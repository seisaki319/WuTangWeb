Four macs, caught a nice sale for four stacks
Yeah, me and my nigga Arafat
Gotta escape but we'll be right back, real soon
Chef cook it up, we got a date with real goons
Telling you Ghost, my connect crazy with the wet
Might know him used to talk to his sister named Yvette
I speed it up, me and the Linx, was getting weeded up
I beat it up, yeah I hit that, but I ain't seed it up
Meanwhile, back on the block, we seen two trucks
Then the windows rolled down, we see these two fucks
Soon as they jumped out, see these tools bust




Yeah, yo, I lit a boogah up, rocks is gone, so we baggin' up all shape
Binoculars, scanners, we all listen to jake
Ran out of baggies, my mouth is dry
Got them dirty joints that scatter, don't act surprised
Nah, nigga the currency rushes like popping a wheelie
Holding a pipe with one hand, the other countin' the billies
You know how it be with the peppermint Clarks, throwing darts at a hoodrat
Getting slow neck up in The Bronx
That's all me, thirty four shines, forty four lines
I just chill like Aaron Hall, writin' raw rhymes
Like, threw Kool-Aid rubies in a lemonade bezzle
When I was twelve in the church, I started packin' that metal
A deuce-deuce, my supplier was Loose Bruce
Ever since I had the drop, my instinct was to shoot-shoot
This ain't For the Love of Ray J, it's for the love of the AK
Cuz you can get scratched like AJ
Cuban Link Dynasty has emerged, this rap shit stop
I have a team of niggas moving my furs

Just like two murders in the hood, I'mma double up
The rap surgeon fix the game up, crack merchant
Everything I sell is well, my shit is that worthy
GATs that come up out the ceiling with the beam on it
Chinese Queen, Parasuco jeans on her
Rock long jeans, known for throwing blings on her
I stay king, by any means scream on it nigga


Come on, let's go nigga
Word up, close the door to the Aston nigga
Yo, get out the, take that shit out the ash tray man


Do you remember a real gang member?
Choppin' til he timber, December to December
Never stoppin', too busy poppin' off lead in the heat
Clownin' ass all around him, they crown him the Dogg Father
Glock hot, crock pot on the block with a chef
Out of bounds on the grounds with a hole in your chest
Invest in back in feedback, gorilla the west
Take a whiff of me, spliff, till it fill up my chest
Convertible with the Cadillac, mackin' the mack
With some Roscoe's Chicken in my lap, imagine that
I'm groovin' down Sunset Boulevard
No harm, no foul, no body guard


Yo, stop right there man
You don't know what you're doin' man
Chill, chill, let them handle that man for real


Chill yo, the movie is scary
Take off the sheep skin shotty
Nigga make a move, and don't dare me
I'm blessed with these million dollar hands, I'm like poker
Niggas screw they motherfuckin' face, so what?
Guns are collected, flips perfected
Boats flying in, every brake's inspected
The clique's connected, everybody wrist and neck lit
Two shots of Cisco, let's slip
Post like Scarface and Sosa with my memosa
All that motion, see my billiongs posted and roastin'
See my villains most of them roastin'
Freshmen chickens get close in 'em
Make one move, she buyin' me the Ghost in it


Pass the dutchie
You know what it do man
We in Wonderland huh


Stealth but get loud like a space shuttle
Catch a case, a motherfuckers got a place for you
And it's 100 brothers like you that's cold with the Typhoo
Slang and things and buck 50 with the jinzu
Draw that line, flip that dime, spit that nine
Homie this Crip on mine
Thought you knew
We cold crushin' bum rush the chef, it's my nephew
The king of the west too, niggas to test you
Let your next move be your best move
Ja bless you
1,2 1,2 what you gone do when we come through?
1,2 1,2






I'm like a 2009 Jordan, known to be sporting
New waves, new uniform on, important
Political prisoner, charisma, got me sniffing money
Regardless, jumping out the V dog with RZA
Hypothetically my joint athletically better be
We safe and in question, nigga, you said it be
Fully charged, new one-on-one in the garage
Large, niggas they chill and bitches they dodge
What's the deal, little homey, it's only real, got tech and ill
I only carry steel out when I'm lonely
Bloodhounds who play the building, buildin', brick at a time
Trying to turn my little dime into a million


It's like back in the days, when niggas used to hustle for this skrilla
Formulate a plan, don't even plot, just get a nigga
But see, we knew a crew of dudes, who hustled a lot, we broke
The opportunities and set up drug deals in the parking lot
Stacking cuz it's necessary, notice how the world go round
See it's imperative, we get richer than rich
You see we hustling across the border (Icewater)
Hurting the town, this money probably got me mistreating your bitch (Do it big)




Wishing I could rap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately Ive been dreaming bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls, and enough money I could rule the world

If I ruled the world..


If I ruled the world, I would buy it all
Im addicted to champagne and buying the mall
Im addicted to living life above the law
How much do it take to live above the law?
I call my homie Ralph up, cause his car stop
Told him bump a new car, come grab the car lot
That way you can have convertibles, and a hard top
Open up a few doors, since we had a hard knock, life
Like, open up, Where restaurants and legs stay opened up
Start a franchise
So my dog can quit wearing a 44 up on his waist like its his pants size
And to my OG locked up bumping Ready or Not
Who was just trying to do it Big, but wasnt Ready to Die
Cop a first class whatever he like, with hoes already inside
Now he can rest in peace while he alive




Is this a dream, well thats how it feels
Sometimes I got to pinch a fat ass to see if its real
I specifically remember, no heat in the winter
Now I supply heat for the winter
Then I skate to the beach for the winter
When it comes to chips boy, nigga get a grip
No cleats Im a winner
Show love to the hoes and the freaks I remember
Hit the club and raise hell all week for the sinners
Meet the young Dennis, the menace of society
Check my sobriety fuck hoes in varities
Shame that these things is the reasons you admire me
But, Im getting doe man these flows gon retire me
Splurging all crazy, switching lanes in the Range swerving all crazy (Swerv)
Style on Nadal, Ive been serving yall lately
Cheddar on Federer
Ball till I fall, et cetera, et cetera




Grey walley black stitchin on a train same slang plain Jane
The strial is crispy
24 Karats gazelles clear..
Im so fly real year
Price so la fill weary
Besides killin gear
Its sniffin plain white lines
But jumpin off phenomenal missions
Yep drugs sellers that was in '88
Learnt how to true
Shoot through my coolers
Escape my Uncle huskie karate nigga
Die who stayed in jail
He did a twenty piece
He came home, block movers still know who he is
To us we was kids he said get rich and love life
Dont fuck with no pigs yo
Those days are hazed
Now we in chronic mode
No more plays
Runnin up a rob a clothes home or what
All we had was us and its sucks
Fly niggas is broke
Smoke coke, weed, and dust
I changed for the better
Brand new Beretta
Slappin a nigga face at the steal give me your leather
Through it all I learnt a lot
Plus I burnt a lot
The chronic now returned the clock






H-A-V-O, I'm iller, rocking over Dilla
Paint a picture clearer than a mirror
I come from that era where everything matters
Lyrics counting for something, careers got shattered now
Everybody's rock stars, who am I to knock 'em though
Daring something, if you do, you fall like a domino
Smoke a little tropical, niggas is so comical
But I been stopped laughing a long time ago
Ain't nothing funny, head knocked off shoulders
Everytime I spit, it's like I put the game to the cobra
Babies to the game it's I'm pushing they strollers
Coming at me sideways, they in a rush to get older
First round is over
I ain't playing with them, no, I wake 'em up like Folgers
I'm a general, believe that, ya'll nothing but soldiers
Like Cee, I'm a finisher, the number one closer


I'm about my business
Don't worry bout me, homey, mind your business
Cuz this is grown folks business
Nothing to do with you, so just mind your business
All day, every day, about my business
Niggas keep talking, I'mma pop the biscuit
Keep playing, have your brain leaking that liquid
Sit back, enjoy, the flow


Yo, we project livers, lick that liver
Run with a bag of cash and flip that wig up
Won't deny it, holding iron, flows is giant
Catch you with nine keys, supplying
Come to my town, strap up
Underground kings with the crown, black down and blacked up
Reefer is the greatest, paid us, Las Vegas, nineteen a pop
Catch me up top famous
Everything on my wrist, Swiss made
Run up in the Gucci shop, Glock warm, give me the Crys' suade
Everybody living to get paid
Everybody make it out the hood, or get sprayed or get grazed
Yeah, yo, my style is trifyn'
Anything on my neck, hands is lightning
Come tear it down, I might sing
Never on a stand, only my writing hand with bright lens
With seal, baby bro




Yeah, beast mode, H-A-V-O
Dudes get popped, snitches sing like Ne-Yo
That's why you always catch me rocking for dolo
Police putting pressure, niggas acting all homo
Can't fuck with em, puff on that piff then they analyze
Looking for what it is, watch for the landmines
Run but you can't hide, lyrical landslide
Homicide, know about you, but I got mines
Grind like the gears on a Porsche, I'm so driven
Foot to the pedal, I'm heavy footed, there's no limit
No gimmick, what you see is what you get it
No skinny jeans, only thing fitting is my fitted
Knowhatimean? Some of ya'll won't get it
I do my own thing, hold to my pivet
Yeah, life can be a bitch, but we live it
To the fullest, niggas just made cuz we chilling





Cat I got to take him off of here, that's right
I got to take him off of here
Cause there's only one, and that's me
You understand? 'fore all that fighting, you understand
That sucka think he good, that sucka think he can whoop me
And I know he can't whoop me, I...
Ay boy, the nigga whole style is chump
You understand?
Let me get mines first
Then after I get mines, you can do what you want to do...


Yeah, scandalous
Yeah miraculous, the arsonists


Yo, kicked down the door in the spot, 260
2L, I heard they had O's for sale
I heard the same shit, money drive a burgundy whip
Keep a low fade, license plates engraved "PAID"
Where's the cat from, think he's from New Jerusalem
Pretty Rick did his thing for him, but he was using him
Boss Sun's younger physical, you know the God
He go with Tip, the one who called Lover of God
Why Equality Self, I know the Master Allah Now
It's time to get the God U and blow like mines
But on the low I heard he got Born Original sent
Back in a drive-through Kentucky Fried shot up his Ac
We got to get him dun, aliens is snatching our bread
UFOs moving in with bigger plans than Feds, yo
Knock on Daddy-O's door get the scope
He's not home, he took Ishmael to Park Slope
There go the the dreads yo, swindle two bags of that skunk
That get you crashed out had you laid out like bums
Peace Kiana, what's up with your girlfriend Wanda
She drive a cream Honda, with legs like Jane Fonda
I just left her, she took Regine to Pathmark then
Jetted to Canal to get her man some Clarks
She should be back in ninety minutes, Ghostface
God forbid she safe, BCW was watching the kids


Two hours later, scheming like DeNiro in Casino
Son better have more coke than Al Pacino
Kiana ain't telling no lies, last year she did a sting and a half
With Tymeek bought him a aircraft
But anyway, yo, Daddy-O home, we need the shotties nid-ow
When we get back, throw you a thid-ou
Later that night, stay mesmerized yo
Go get the green 5, meet you on the corner of Now Why
You ready, you got the E&J and the machete?
We going upstairs, I hope one nigga is heavy
We walked in, both of us, looked like terrorists
Masks on, second floor, dun yo, I handle this
Kick in the crib, the whole shit looked graphical
Natural, fucking a white bitch, actual
Fiends chanting, "Do your thing Chef, handle it"
I shot him in the neck, it ricocheted and hit Carolyn
Ran to the back analyzing, much disguising
Surprise is coming in their eyes and tranquilizing
Bugging, throwing the twin cousins at his nugget, fuck it
Meet shottie waddy slug body hobby
Where the drugs, where the ounces you be bouncing
Fake cats announcing on the block, you lounging
Where the blow at, I ain't got shit, stop fronting
(Yo Chef, throw the joint in his mouth, money'll stop stunting
Bitch, hold that pit, before I push your wig back
Chef stop waving that, show him where the paper at)
Come here Valerie, you know the God he need a salary
Put down the pipe here's two tickets to a coke gallery
It's in the kitchen in the ceiling
(Baby girl kept squealing
Only found a white block of cheese from New Zealand
Ohhh shit! Yo, yo where that shit at yo?
Yo Chef, where that shit? What? What? Aiyyo...)




Did he have hands?
Did he have a face?
Yes
Then it wasn't us


Bernard Goetz Gazelle's on
.45 in the bag, mask a Bourdon
Sacks Willy jury is all really
Rich nigga's paying for the team
Sniff the eighth and feed Lily
Lily is a cocaine Willy
Who got mad connects in a small town in Philly
Octopus soul sister rock a puss
Ghost outside parked vertical
Yeah, the Jakes'll murder you
Four to five hundred bricks
Dicks come in with no tie on
That symbolizes the wire on
All Krylon heat my rings bling 500 feet away
Hit the church steeples in the D
Brand new shells on, a python, a Fisker
Twist from the Astons made for the listener
Or rather yeah, the driver, suicide rider
B bums and Wally's, me and Shallah's colleagues


4 in the morning 


Blow hands, the stove is a roaster where bottles whip in motion
May cause 'drop him in the ocean'
Irish blood gangsters, the roulettes
Cooler moving through Texas, grandmother she Mex-ish, yup
Tablets, krills, bath salts, last call, get it
Drugs flying minutes like a fastball
Smash all, I will remain clean, the status calm
I do it for niggas who last long
Last Don's chill, Kings in the chair, cigars in the air
This the last part with snakes that'll break any mans arm
Which way the grass growin'
We've sown enough and now we're farmers
Who come through with lawn mowers and armor


4 in the morning 


Yeah, I used to move cracks, sort diesel and gats
Runnin' trains on them hood rat bitches up in the trap
We used to blow 'em out
Fiends comin' in hike with they seized bite
With residue stuck all on they pipe
4 in the mornin' when the gates start jumpin'
Dustheads lurkin' and the fiends start thumpin'
And it seems like the fiends, he own CREAM, so they jumpin'
Bean told Cream he stole green so he cut em
Ditch him Star, souflee'd one half of his cheekbone
Now he talkin' out the side of his mouth
But yo, peep homes, stuck
Fly dust, that's four finger nuggets
With plastic stuffed in the Kangol buckets
Dirty burners on, gloves and scanners
Smart mouth, Teymor bitches in the back gettin' sandwiched
After a dick suck accountant
In the wee hours, backing up mountains
4 in the morning


4 in the morning 




Yeah! Come on! I know many boney niggas that knock big niggas out
Force MC's to write more when my pen is out
Indian Gym's pedestal prince sit on thrones
Crack bones hardly pay back loans
Fuck a Maybach I hash back a three G stone
One bitch, four fifth, rubber grip, never hidden it's shown
This is for dirt balm niggas wingworm babies who smell like piss in school
Smoke wombs, rob and tote tools
Jail and poke fools, bash niggas in the head
With forties after thatm shake your hand and get more brew
Please be at ease God, fuck the disease God
You rap niggas front on me, I'm a squeeze God
Headline, man get sprayed by retard
Ghostly thing, he left behind the red clark
His gun bark up big trees
Made his dust with embalming, olivie oil and mint leaves
When y'all bag up your fuckin bottles is empty
We serve glaciers that's why the fiends is friendly


Streetrunner gotta stop runnin sometime

Lord the borough's mainframe, I remain the same chain
Lames play the game to gain cock and aim the than thang (Bang!!!)
I let the thang rang then became the king of caine
Gettin chains slingin thangs no different than Richard mane
Call a order off the water y'all native New Yorker
Caught a case the law was lacin y'all with eights and raw the states applaud
Facin it for sure with just the taste the states and laws
Made to degrade my age limit diminish my cause
Ain't nothin to us nothin move us tightly knitten up and through us
Type of shit the hype the gripe I got despite my life is it
And what you talk is what we walk
And what we up we love this spot
Place none above me of course faithfully yours
I hate when it warms, rapin the law
Came through the door with a cape and cane
Sayin my name wavin the four
Displayin the false aim and then buss claim it was yours
Ain't no team hotter than Team Saga sign the Lord!!!


Streetrunner gotta stop runnin sometime
I'm gonna make you leave, I'm gonna make you leave, I'm gonna make you leave!!!


Who wanna feel the fire from me fuckin with the don
Just save the Ying Yang for Lil' Jon kid it's on

Devious one, and anytime you need me it's done
Some talkin off the yap trip and what they gonna do?
But know they couldn't find the fuckin heart with John Q
I'm hear to warn you, we vouched your plans
My name is sent to 'mounts of millions you get thousand fans
Little fly by night nigga that's about to land
Let me take the shit up out of your hands
Understand, your games won't work can't hide your own jerk
And any technicalities I'm pullin on skirts
Beside the mink jacket that be where the chrome lurks
So make sure my paper write like we checkin homework, come on

Stay strong like old man in dentures
Wintertime rockin the fox, hangin with Bruno Mars, The Lox
Sting, yo, Nas pops
We gettin honeys, Rat Pack clique in my gunny
Blowin two Ls, Ocean 11 this money
Floss stays coolin on them horses
Hoppin over logs, long Polo boots, ownin them Porsches
Maxin king, everything Gucci
Just like the suits I play Saturday to stay in Jacuzzis
Brother Man, Im floatin to mother lands
And came back with ounces of gold, wrapped aside, rubber bands
Hangin in McCormick & Schmitz
Doin my OG thing, slangin some caine in the mix


Ill be flying to the islands when its cold outside
Matching furs, his and hers, got matching black cars
On my life, livin right, baby, love is no limit
Lifes good either way, 'long as you in this



Uh, from bulletholes and graffiti
Being low to exposing money rolls on the TV
Clothes on neatly, cologne switching weekly
Women chose don't need to be told how to treat me
Discreetly used to dick em down just for gp
Freaky, now i worth a fortune on Phoebe's
Easy with em 22s on the shoes
Just chill with the factory feel I'm still cool
Refuel fresh from the era low sweater cold weather
Used to beef if Ra' or Kane flow better
Forever, larry davis live be obliged
For those broads being blessed to absorb a nigga vibe
Reside, in various places some spacious
Others is basic but the facelift escalates it
Persuasive, parle with many but not friendly
Cop a lensi fly versace and rock fendi
Indie, came from the bottom no problem
Nothing surprising niggas try but can't size him
Possum, me and the mrs. gourmet dishes
Instagramin our pictures under chandelier fixtures
Scriptures, straight from the heart my pen's dark
Chess players deep what i peep i pick apart
My wisdom's sharp wine and dine when it's time
Line for line, leaving that crime shit behind
The world is mine, suited and booted so secluded
Leaving em clueless, this is how thorough niggas do this






Bob Digi, U G.O.D, Raekwon the Chef, the Inspectah Deck

The burners and the stash, we 'bout the cash
We got females that got it like that
The golden childs that bone the crowd
See, niggas in the place that bit my style
Well, I'm a singer, dancer, we bulletproof brothers
Wu-Tang got the answer
Cause if I had a chance to do it again
I will still keep the heat in my pants-uh


Y'all be nice to the crackheads, everybody listen up
I shot one of my bitches, the ho ain't trick enough
Word life to big screen Don, tapping dustbones out
With starwriters like I fucked Celine Dion
Stuck everything that's the god's honest beyond
We airin' niggas out, that's the type shit that we on
Official Wu-Tang headbanger
Flood your space with big waves like you did in Sri Lanka


I drink heavy gallons of cru, play the big part
Niggas got squid on the grill, selling kids Clarks
Finesse notes, yo, the Guess on with the vest pose
Yellow swede one matching hat with the grey gun
Niggas be rhymin' for nothing, then my team pull up
We all throw down y'all broke niggas stay frontin'
Lines come digital stupid, plus ain't got no jewelry on
Bet I'm still live and I'm coopin'
Two of my silverbacks run through a pack of your wolves
Front on react, we're sippin' Cognac  relax dude
Know I'm with these cracks dude


Yo, 1-2, Dirt McGirt
Solid tone smith with 6th shots, lick shots
Leave your head like a Shaolin monk with 6 dots
Brooklyn Zoo, Zoo
Brooklyn Zoo


It's the return of Bin Laden, grab your armor
Smash pretty boy niggas, crush their karma
Eat bones with alligators, roll deep with my entourage
My whole crew's fresh out the bars
Diggler AKA the Cab Driver
Drop him off in the middle of fire
Dirty Island, drag bodies to the Murderland
Knock niggas out hurtin' my hand


I remember in the elevator we was playin' corners
Now we play the corners and the cops is stayin' on us
Staten's where the war is
Where the court system's running out of warrants
Where TNT be jumping out the Taurus
For real I can't call it
You see I love Lucy cause she Lawless
Exactly like that 1-0-3-0-4 is
Snitch niggas swallow your tongue
Already know the island I'm from
And y'all don't want no problems with them


We got a history full of lightning victories
Conceptual breakthrough, it ain't no mystery
Long vision from giants in every way
Rap czars, magnificent flows for every day
From the East to the 'ville, from the West to the hills
Incredible rhymes, encouraging skills
From rat packs, the smallest crews were enormous
We hit 'em fast with an effortless performance
MCs start fleeing in flocks
Especially those that's more sensitive to heat and shock


We grindin' down to the bone, my name grounded in stone
I'm Mr. Violence we loungin' with chrome
Mr. Violence we lounge in his home, hit the housing on Rome
Shining like a hundred thousand in stones
Move mountains with poems, got a jones for dinero
1-6-zero my songs we throwin' elbows
The hoes cling, sho thing, we know kings
Only dime dikes with minds right, we choose Queens


Yeah, we wild like rockstars who smash guitars
Yo son split his face with the toast, he ain't ghost
It's no joke iron coat rifle with the stroke
One toke brains float, shot to the throat
Before the smoke hit, witness the killing, chilling crime scene
Body on the block, eyes open from the shock
Of being popped in the neck
Yet he still held a lit cigarette between his fingers
Danger when you step into the chamber with the Masta
Disaster, gotta blast ya cause I have to


The rat pack is back from the island of Stat'
Leave you cursed dust, cause you worship the Gat
The first one to snap drunk off the Smirnoff
Blow the bouncer's ear off, let him floss he the boss
Handcuffed, to the turntables like Wizard Theodore
See it's pure, let it rain pearly ounces
Bang him with the thing that hang from the trousers
You don't want no drama, I'm flaming fast
That nigga jumped up and did the Damon Dash



Abaleya kopala




Wake up... wake up
Wake up...


Wake up, get a hold of your life, go get your cake up
The motto in the streets is you eat, or you get ate up
Straight up, you tired of waiting, go get your weight up
My peoples tired of waiting for reparations to pay us
Screaming Jesus can save us, I, I get the Bentley if I save up
But that's just another trick to enslave us
Push the minimum wages
Put, put our fathers up in them cages
Then watch out when mother struggled to raise us
But, but my ambition won't let me live in this poor condition
That doesn't care about color, creed, or your religion
Priests, politicians gotta listen to opposition
From my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in
From my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in


Allah said to save the babies from the cold
Pour wisdom in the cup so the truth overflows
Still, knowledge is that bread that keeps us well-fed
Old time religion will not bring us satisfaction
Without action now who can disagree with me?
God is not a mystery, there's nowhere in history
That you could show and prove to me
But still you face east and nod your head to me religiously
I'm G-O-D, to infinity, for real


The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me


Poor reparations, the Bush administration
Unequality, martial law, segregation
False hood, false teaching, false education
Now's the time for us to come amongst this nation
They deceiving us, they don't believe in us
They believe in that Cream like Julius Caesar
I'm like Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X with the heaters
Ripping the chains of the remains of all of the leaders
Never worship the image of evil swine eaters
I'm on the back of the bus with two fine divas
We in the jungle of life, but never jungle fever
I'm God-body all day long, spiritual life lessons
That I recite in this song
Trying to wake up everybody, can't we all get along?
For all my people that's out there persevering through the storm
Black fist, Staten Island, stand up, stand strong
Penetrate through the gate and bring the Clan along


The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me


Wake up and realise the times
That we living in the world is getting more iller than ever
Thought we was chillin', striving change for the better
But it was a dream like Martin Luther
He had a vision that could move a mountain
Protect one another, that's world to my brother Malcolm
As-salamu alaykum, alaykum as-salam
We want justice, police supposed to protect and serve
And then they shoot us down like wild animals
The nerve of them cold-hearted killers
With blue suits slaying our black youth
The earth cries from all the blood that's being spilled
We need a solution fast, get InshAllah bill
Let me educate them, translate it meaning God's will
It goes all in together, together how we are
To stand with a plan, provided we down to fall
And that's the Willie Lynch tactics that separated the masses
Taught us all to think backwards




The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me

We gonna change the world (x5)




Aiyo, Shallah, what up? (Yeah, you know how we do it)
(Turn me up, kid, let's get it popping)
Crazy, let's go get 'em killa (Yo Dre, good looking on this coke, man)
(This shit is official)


Aiyo, it's back to business, making them diskettes, pushing sixes
Rocking wild animals on jackets are sickening
Hear me? From here to Rockaway to Cali, we flipped this
Broad day, Chef'll saute, his lyrics is crispy
Now I got Dre up in the kitchen, Rae stuck in position
Bout to flame broil his coke and get busy
What? Politics, pop collars and drive violent whips
Stay fly, hungry and wise, you know the code, honor it
Sit back, yelling it's nothing, unless his buttons get pressed
We don't stress nothing, we only get dressed
Stretched out, moving professional, frying more fish
I heard it in slurs, them niggas is blessed
While we ball to the maximum, give me the floor, for real
I show off and let my money get stretched
Take it to a new level, new bezzle, few rebels
Few wolves with medals on, you know we get test


Me, nigga, me, that's who, Cash Rule
(Hah, better slow it down, niggas'll smash you, homey, uh)
Me, nigga, me, pass through, rascals
(Hah, half gorilla, half ape in them track suits, black, come on)
Me, nigga, me, capsules, birds, whips
Ounces and fifths (no licking the glass, duke, yeah)
Yeah, yea-yea-yeah, yea-yea-yeah, yeah (yeah)
I'm here, so it's there, yea-yea-yea-yeah, yeah


Here comes the, a lethal presentation taking you places you never been
Deadlier than the combination of coke and heroin
I see the weakness in most of you niggas that be hollering
So I toned it down, so these words be piercing your lower obdomen
What I meant to say abdomen, keep on listening and following
While I'm ditecting a German, hateful niggas, chicks be swallowing
And if you look funny to me, and there's a problem then
I put you under an ultraviolet light or a halogen
As if I was busy deciphering counterfeit dollars and
Hoes in like some kind of Biblical figure, King Solomon
Hah, just for the record, what we do is essential
While I captivate the masses and keep the moments eventful
Doc Dre, Bust, Shallah Rae, see the vision?
Most you niggas still in disbelief, just came into fruition now
Pop the cork up off this bottle and you pour it
So euphoric, document this moment, shit is so historic




King of kings spit blood, all on my apron
Wash a nigga's face with the MAC, smoke them like Steak Umm's
Yeah my dynasty's brolic for real, we hunt, eat, catch the rat
Blow his waist, float in the stream
You know we all-pro with it, anti auto-tune
Boom, my flow fire, sit by the stove, hit it
Real niggas, official as listeners, gangstas and visitors
Step in the shit, we all prisoners
Might take the hammer from you, know I'm the animal
Rock a spur fur hat, no niggas in sandals, boo
Everyday get money and dress rugged, these are the times
Keep a nine on you, blow off in public
And I will surely feed my niggas the streets
Cop the hottest things to get, and haters they can eat and then preach
And while it go down, worldwide, this the team, this the theme
Me, Dre, Rhymes, my money makers is mean, what?






Yeah, ah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, ah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, ah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, ah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you know how we do it
Turn me up, kid, let's get it popping
Yo Dre, good looking on this coke, man
This shit is official


Aiyo, it's back to business, making them diskettes, pushing sixes
Rocking wild animals on jackets are sickening
Hear me? From here to Rockaway to Cali, we flipped this
Broad day, Chef'll saute, his lyrics is crispy
Now I got Dre up in the kitchen, Rae stuck in position
Bout to flame broil his coke and get busy
What? Politics, pop collars and drive violent whips
Stay fly, hungry and wise, you know the code, honor it
Sit back, yelling it's nothing, unless his buttons get pressed
We don't stress nothing, we only get dressed
Stretched out, moving professional, frying more fish
I heard it in slurs, them niggas is blessed
While we ball to the maximum, give me the floor, for real
I show off and let my money get stretched
Take it to a new level, new bezzle, few rebels
Few wolves with medals on, you know we get test


Me, nigga, me, that's who, Cash Rule
You better slow it down, niggas'll smash you, cousin
Me, nigga, me, pass through, rascals
Half gorilla, half ape in them track suits, black
Me, nigga, me, capsules, birds, whips
Ounces and fifths no licking the glass, duke
Yeah, yea-yea-yeah, yea-yea-yeah, yeah (yeah)
I'm here, so it's there, yea-yea-yea-yeah, yeah


Yo, I be on the Island, wildin', stallions under the Phantom hood
With the V12 growling like Mike Vick's pit bulls, the last one to die
Probably cried, chinky eyes, heading straight for the dirt
That's how it is in my hood, Compton, niggas put you under the Earth
Four-five bulging out that white T-shirt like a hard on
This block shit is ill, like the nigga that put Raekwon the God, on
I can drink to that, but all the Patron probably gone
Chef brought the Hennessey, we start to get our polly on
Ashy knuckles, taped up veggies in a duffle
Back to back Beemers, Moss'll play me in a huddle, yeah
I pop big shit, New York Knick shit
L.A. Laker paper, Kobe coming off a pick, shit
I'm the shooter, the marble rip ruger
Hard tops, we tell stories like Slick Rick the Ruler




I'm that live little live nigga up in the Lex
Swinging through hoods, ratchets and a couple Gillette's
Peoples is straight, can't tell me nothing, we cake
Rolling lovely, bricks and white shit up in Mercedes
I live by the code, I was never a fake
When it's time to ride, I be in the front with the ace
Lighting blunts, Marvin Gaye shit, bumping them great
Glass of Cru', get a writing hand, wiping the paint
Candy apple shine, all my niggas in the line, pollying
Everybody jollying, and we straight
What it do, baby, Wu coming through in that new Mercedes
Everybody looking like it's Houston, but it ain't
Staten Island hot boys, pushing them hot toys
You gon' fuck around and let your woman get you got boy
Who ripped the fever back in '97, rip the year?
Who came in Cali after west coast gangstas there?






Ayo Kayslay, Papoose (huh)
I finna cook some shit in the kitchen with ya'll niggas
Let's go


Busa Bus and Papoose will come and really hurt this
I fuck you niggas up, see none of you niggas serve a purpose
I hook on niggas like Kareem and jail em like Julius servants
See these niggas powerless on how we reemarges
So deserving of the title, crown it, whatever you call it
And though you niggas was havin fun, see we come to spoil it
Treatin niggas like the shit they are, flush em down the toilet
Bitch see you can't afford it, see I'm advising you to forfeit
Gotta come up off it, homie what you doin ain't that importent
See we don't need what you got plus the street don't want it
Yo Pap come get these niggas and slap them across the face
With some more venomous rap, spike the strappers up on our waist
When we in the place, I know you know he we do this nigga
If you think you new muthafucka, I'm the newest nigga
With the newest money, with the newest album, the newest label
The newest cars, cribs, roll chains, used to call them cable
New commercial landscapes, get me a new stable of bitches
Their thoroughbreds, I'm meticulous and very anal
About how I'm gonna strike and attack you cus I'm able
And give it to you niggas back and white like I'm interracial
And continue to keep it lyrical just to make them hate you
Sometimes make me so cynical until I come and stick you
Stick a pitch fork in em, watch while I come to take them up
To another level, if you sleep, we came to wake em up


See you might get a blister when we give you the heat
Better address me as mister, see me in the streets
Mr. Papoose, Mr. Busa Bus, this is grown man shit
Repect niggas like they born with it
The hood they always talk with it (you hear them talkin about us?)
But we the top rank, flawless in our weight class
You niggas don't really want problems, see every time we come with it
Shit is obvious, you muthafuckas straight ass


Papoose, you can call me Mr. Clientele
My mixtapes make more sales the Nextel
I ain't hard to find, they know where I dwell, hell
Never been a chubby niggas, I'm skinny like twelve 12s
You had that cocaine for so long it smells stale
I make hell sales, my caine GOAT like LL
Rip the smif n wessun with quick aggression
And get the reppin, rip the nigga's neck in
Bang his head in and cave his chest in less than sixty seconds
Spit the weapon through his intestines
Hit the exit, can't get arrested, it's pig infested
Got sick obsessions, for walking in nigga's sessions
I make illest efforts to disrespect em with different gestures
My wisdom threatens these wicked peasants with ill intentions
He said he was laying in the cut, but shit's infected
I got disprefected, I am the sheppard, so spin the record
I'm representin for this profession I ressurrected
I'm giving belssings within the lessons of his intentions
This is the essence of my lyrics brethren, Busta Rhymes is a living legend
I don't know what you acting like you're heartless for
When you know that you're a target like the department store
Cus Justo gave me the crown, and ya'll knew it
My song's ruthless, your bars truthless, it's all foolish
Fill you with embaldment fluid, this is ex con music
I'm like the Van ???, I'll show you how a con do it




Blood on the Chef's hatchet, I'm here for the action
Kill a hundred niggas with aspirins and piss in they caskets
4-5s rip through your glasses, all mine, Mr. Gymnastics
Gimme more time, or visit the blasters
Cus I'm starving, hungry for classy, I'm dead up your lassy
See it's nothing, press a few buttons, the city's diasaster
Ayo anthrax em and axe em with sianide acid
Choke em out, escape in the cold and left through Lake Placid
Stop fronting, know you a pastor, you know I'm a master
I'm like six sixes in traffic, you niggas is taxes, hardbodies come
Through jurassics
It's all about mausberg lugers, loadin them rachets, blow them like napkins
Cus I'm elevated at the top of my flowest power
The m-o stay young, fly, and rish like ?raw child?
With transaction, grandmaction, niggas on the stove maxin
Throw a thousand birds off the road, while my soldiers catch it
Playin all the lobbies, the Gotti's the red Mazaratis
My colleagues will blow something, show you Karate
We know the code, pot, X and parties, the live section
Keep him on his toes, take off them chromes and pass them to mami
Cus the feds around us, watchin us, ?Gottis? is everybody's laundry
We could prbably get more if we hunting, probably
We hang niggas, bang pistols, take a piece of your finger
Same whistle, you better respect it cus my name sizzle






Yeah, yeah, a special guest appearance
From the slums.... yo, aiyo


I examine your diameter, third eye light the camera up
Be careful, I got four ninjas, inside your parameter
Perimeter, flame burst out all sides like Gamora
My poisonous is released, gas from the canister
Raise the black fist, we keep the earth on it's axis
I make a good day move slow like molasses
Welcome to the bee hive, dual processor with the G5
There's not a tape or disco break I can't revive
In this high tech world of fire wire and microchip
We still keep the four-five clip, filled with the spiral tip


I come from the 36 Chambers of danger
With many lyrical swordsmen, that quick to change ya
The difficulty to see closely, is mostly
It's a critical point, when ya rap niggas approach me
Like the blind, deaf, dumb, who mind was left numb
A non B-Boy nigga, couldn't rhyme to the drum
When I started M.C.'ing I entered, the gates of pleasure
Not knowing, I be coming with, too much to measure
With the math of an elder, and the steel of a welder
The path of tray, that I had laid down, to held a
Blueprint, that would draw attention like the Pope
I examine all with the internal mirror of the scope


Supreme deluxe edition, CREAM with a touch of wisdom
Beams that through up the system, spleens, I conduct, you listen
How you gonna tell me no, yo, the fuck you is in
Locked in a four block radius like a public prison
Twenty two year old, dunn, ain't got a cup to piss in
But he got a barrel gun, and that's knuckle twitching
And he got a baby moms and a cousin bitching
Went to catch a body, now he stuck in another prison


When you see it, you better acknowledge, your all swords
Blaze the green hundred fours
Pull out on you, blew you for the cause
And Sudan outst a nigga, seclude you from my Clan
This is water Glock, aces on cameras sniffin' raw
Why try to fuck with these lecturers
I'm so high powered, my electrical structure blew down the floor
You was king for a second, I reigned, came with a different name
The W.T.C. Family and more, one!


They applause when I make my entrance
I move on 'em with age and experience, before I start the sentence
The rhyme was designed to meet most demand
Is enough to compensate, fertilize the land
He blew out the belt drive, M.C.'s they felt vibes
Powerful dart, narrowly missing your whole tribe
Scientists look, at the magnitude and devastation
But the strands of heavy metal seem to have no relation
But it's always potential for large scale disasters
Because the instrumentals, spins a hundred times faster
Many was taken, is at the price of a pawn
And the collective lost had left, thousand of mourn
Them Clansmen, are the nucleus of hip-hop
There's no room for error, M.C.'s will get dropped
Evidence of terrifying threats from heat pressure
Power by strong winds that blew rhymes off the dresser
The words spread through the town from Yonkers to Leffers
And to kill off the slang was a city wide effort
But they couldn't be more wrong, my click was all strong
Fit together seamlessly, til you're all gone


The queen by far, is the strongest piece
Should too, should not be prematurely brought
Into play, during in the opening
Or she will be attacked by wicked pieces
And driven back, it is very dangerous
To make a raid with the queen early on in the game
It is best, in opening, to make but one move with the queen
And that, to a square where she is not exposed
To any direct or indirect attack




(After the smoke is done)
Yo yeah
(Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one)
Yeah, what, what, who wanna do it, what
(After the smoke is done)
Slap fire outcha monkey ass niggas
(Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one)
Word up, big dick, motherfucking house
Whaddup, bench press these cats, yo


Yo, god show these niggas how we get deep, down and dirty
Like Keyon, got his wig pushed back, for 5 birdies
Yo they gotta hit placed on my head, what should the god do?
Max out in Spain and do business with the Jews?
Never that, don't ever look at me out of synch
The imperial, industrial king got weight
Don't give a fuck, like the poor part we watch Hart To Hart
They used to push me in shopping carts, now I'm writing darts
Like Ebenezer, the porno teaser
Saying words like sheeba, ____ rapper valet the visa
My team got rides like Six Flags, plus the Wu lab
Cameras in nine bedrooms we own DATs
Don't touch this crackling hot shit
I snap ya shoulder blade in half, laugh and pop shit
Reader's Digest passed my book to L. Ron Hubbard
It got back that the world government tried to dub it
But devils love it, booby-trap raps cover the track like ADAT
Sharper than cuts laced on Marley
Scratched supreme clientele, my cartel
Willie Stargel passed this shit his piece, where's the Nobel?
Oh well, signing off as usual
The arsonist leaving niggas lost in the stairwell


(Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one)
Yeah, yo, yo, represent my projects Stapleton
(After the smoke is done)
He represent that project Park Hill
(Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one)
You represent that project Murder West Brighton Now Born
Arm banging into that will (ahhhhh), word up
(After the smoke is clear)
Yeah, what, Stapleton
(Delphonics and Wu-Tang still here)
Park Hill, word up, yeah, yeah, New York


The greatest story ever told by me, precisely
Roman numeral IV plus three describe me
My son move like the toad, get drunk, speak in codes
Throw a fiend in the sleeper hold, got beef with the globe
Met my comrade, go half on this lab down in Baghdad
Flipping like a meth's tab, get money like an Arab
The tight niggas snapped six legs on the crab
Now hush, you wanna do what? My clique better bust


Underprivileged, grew up in a Stapleton house village
Where blood flood the water in streets like oil spillage
My front door was blowing, the debt man spotted 55 boa
Niggas was still flowing, voice was echoing
I rise high like an octave
The proctor wouldn't gamble the sample, it shocked her
My ninjas run round like Shaka Zulu, some play peace like Donny the Guru
Others live to be wise and old like Desmond Tutu
Undisputed champion belt holders, shaped and mould us
Soul controller of the lunar, solar or the polar
I blow hash smoke through my nasal, my brain with worth 30 billion
Wu-Tang  battalion was like cannibal weight in Brazilians


After the smoke is done
Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one
After the smoke is done
Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one
After the smoke is clear
Delphonics and Wu-Tang still here
After the smoke is done
Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one
Ahhhhh (Wuuuuuu, wuuuuuu)




Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long, any time she goes away


It started out east New York, where I grew up
Knew how to walk, favorite carry weapon was a 4
Older folks, smoked out stragglers, 
 bust three at yah
Dad fucked up consecutively
Him and some relatives were gangstas, sellin' pussy
Mom  on the spot, smacked me in the knot
Only thing he gave me was a name and a Glock
That shit popped, still that's me still, keep it real
Wasn't for him and the steel, probably wouldn't be 
 out, toned out
Three days away from home, stoned out
Coach 
Son I'm sendin' you home, nigga you foul
 half the niggas I run with










This is the wrong time - but I wish you were all mine
I ain't trying to wait, listen to fate
But what's a man to do?
Said I'm all confused and you ain't trying to choose
Whether I win or lose, baby
Yeah, it's all about you, all about you
It's all about you
Said it's all about you, all about you
Said it's all about you, all about you
Yeah, it's all about you, all about you
All about you


It been about me, I'm a king from the rip
My own millionaire style, my swag on dip
Stay fresh in the freshest places
Flip papers, fly around, Bugattis and yachts
Holding knots, C.R.E.A.M relations
It's like hitting the lotto winning
More money, more problems you gotta be kidding
I'd rather sit up in the Bronx and parlay some shit up
I'm usually breaking down eights and slaying some sit-ups
Boo, it's tight times, let me hustle
Cause everything you want, I'm near with all muscle
Cause when I'm in the streets, we eating, more Ruffles
Then we can play the suits in Vegas, all duffles
Cause you the queen, I'm the king, be a rider
A man with a game plan stressing, ain't a rider
So let me paint picture, stay crisp, we providers
We real, realer than real, word to mamas




Kingpin chef in the town, keep it 100
Ice on his neck and his arms with more money
Jump into the 250 , getting blunted
Pockets carry more than a stack, we all frontin'
Rich black African, dons getting cheddar
Shorty knows  better, let's blow, bring the Beretta
Showing off the vault, you walk, nigga, you're welcome
Or you can stay here and be rich with me and help 'em
I'm just crazy, fly slick intelligence
He play high, on the strips, and flip pelicans
My whole clique is in this bitch, 10 elephants
Who stay fresher than us? That's irrelevant
True, yeah, nothing but a G-thing
Whoa, yo, they be coming through, peep game
Boo, I know it's over baby, keep playing
Oops, I'm out of energy, street king






Straight up, c'mon Bub, I need you dun
Yo, Straight up y'all
Yo Ghost I love you man
You know how we do this right here
We do this for our family
See you soon kid


The greatest thing a kid could have
To chill with his family, sit back laying on his Dad
Props go out, next thing you know Pops roll out
Moms cussed him out, "get the fuck out"
Couldn't understand it, feelings turning to hard granite
Now she a one single parent
Growing up on welfare, she might need healthcare
That made me feel no one else cares
Moms is a part of my life forever
Getting drunk that's her business guess that's stormy weather
Fish and grits, twelve o' clock midnight pissed
Stop crying Ma take a kiss
Take care of ya brother and sis
Something happen to me I miss ya better be offic
She meant that shit, every mouthful accurate
Took me to school be emaculate
Taught by the best, remember stress
A ghetto agenda that's how we rest
Don't let 'em play with your emotions
Lotioning me, little money in my vest
Damn, Mom going through it, still holding me through it
Sneaker money fucked up, yo
Yeah when Granddaddy died, I know you didn't see me cry
Held it in, it hurted Ma a lot
Remember, Bucs had me in a tux
Went to beef stake Charlie's had my first pay cut
Yeah, loving you always
Screaming on janitors in hallways "It's my son" always
Caught me in the crib yo, smoking
Sat me down heart broken
Hoping the phase had me open yo
You like, hey yo, for real
You like loving you for life it's only right
Strong yourself we make it
Weak minded you naked
The pain and hurt I can't take it
Plus my Uncle in jail, that's your brother go see him
He look forward to it like mail
You my ace, you the lady in the place
You ain't a waste, we just trapped inside a low-life place
Trust me I'm gonna work hard
Tattoo my body, throw it on top where I got scars


See it son, start crying


* singing til the end *




 hills driving in your own four wheels
Mansion on top of hills blow chrisp chronic billows
As high as the guest house on 
Flow nasty that's disastrous, pussy wet call me a catalyst
Gymnastic when flipping packages
All in my head, give me head back
Exactly miss dap me sister no doubt
The kid is rich, hard as rich, art is rich
But still I'm gonna walk away the week after
No love unless it's whole love, hoes no love
You get the greatest hugs in the world though, hold up
Like Frank  schooled Max Julien
This how you ride pimpin' shoot from the side, Kwon


Oh baby not tonight
I don't want to fuss and fight
I just want to make it right
Oh there's work to do
I wanna get real close to you
I wanna get you in the mood

All the things you want to do
Just relax and I'll take care of you
And anytime you want me
I'm saying that I love you everyday
And I know that you love me
Baby admit it

Give me all your love and don't stop
I love waiting when you reach the top
(All night long)
Come into my bedroom hun you
What I got will make you spend money
(All night long)




Yes, I got you started, yes, I got you started
All over again


Uh... yeah..
This is on some Can It Be/C.R.E.A.M. shit, right here, too
Yeah, word up, take it there for these niggas, you know
Word up? Yo.. uh-huh, reminisce, nigga
Word up, nice sunny day, rainy day
Preferable for you and yours, let's blow, yo


Who would've thought I would've made it ya'll
Ten years later, still in the gid-game, the Clan, we was one the greatest
We did platinum back in '93, we painted pictures you could see
We was living who ya'll tryin' to be
RZA had a vision, instead of cookin coke in the kitchen
He told the God, hit the booth and start spittin
At first it was a dream to me, Ol' Earth buggin
Put your gun down, screamin that the streets is gon' be needin me
I did the Knowledge to the Wisdom that you spoke to me
The Wu became us, the world enbraced us
A new day, a new life for the God
Got a hood thing, watchin "Ice Water" evolve
Destined to build a mountain - niggas is doubtin my work
Black millionaire, check what I'm worth
I gotta thank y'all for takin in Lex, I appreciate it
I apoligize for keepin y'all waitin


Yes I got you started all over again (x2)
(Word up... let's go back... finish up)


Growin' up, we've been through hard times
Life on the streets, just tryin' survive
Plus my niggas got mouths to feed
We sold to crack fiends, coke, ice and money machines
Shootin' at cops, them maggots tried to stop our C.R.E.A.M
But it won't stop, can't stop, my niggas locked down in a box
I feel your pain, I know you're tryin' to come home
All that weak bullshit, I had to leave it alone
Heard my mom's cryin' at night, we rap on the phone, I love you
Never meant to stress you out, do you wrong, yo I'm workin
Then move you from a block to a home
We came from nothin', seein' how the world is so cold
Some niggas comin' out of churches sellin' devil their soul, yo
My neighborhood is crime central, sort of like prisons and cops
One on lock, instead of tryin' to defend you
All that bullshit we've been through, time to draw the line right here
Got to stop now, time is the issue


Yes I got you started all over again (x2)
(One more jewel... one more... move... let's go, let's go)


It's time to rebuild, teach our seeds, that guns don't kill
It's the nigga behind the trigger that will
Society's ill, blacks support seeds for their mills
Mentally brainwashed, time moves on, we stand still
I seen life through the birth of my son, I seen it all again
A soldier stuck in these streets, hopin' it's war within
Too late to fall now, I'm on now
Niggas is born now, we doin' good, we on tour now
Elevate your prosperity, I'm seein' shit with clarity
No longer on the low, pa, I couldn't handle thieves
Too much to live for, I just wanna poly and grow
Stack ones and watch my little dun's blow


Yes I got you started all over again (x4)




Continous
Yeah, youknowhatI'msayin?
Wu-Tang
Aiyyo aiyyo, come on yo yo yo I'mma shoot over here
On that AIDS thing
YouknowhatI'msayin? I'm gonna just slide in the studio quick and get this done
Yo, yo


When you're sexually frustrated, plus waiting for a long time
You both had strong minds
Combined with feelings, she seems appealing, for each other
Discreet lover, no longer keeps rubbers
Smothered under deep covers
Erotic programs, Moet and slow jams
Enough to make you hold hands and plus you a bold man
You fall in a manhole, where the forbidden tree grow
And bullshit ego, of fly negro
Her garden sour, polluted with a dead flower
Months later, he's layin on a respirator
Depending on a generator, to keep his heart moving
And start losing sight in his right eye
In weeks he might die


I know this dope-fiend cat, word up, his name is Javier
Part-time shooter sharing needles in the stairs
Wise guys disguised as a fly guy, you getting high right?
Weeded up with red shit in your right eye
You's a menace, your brain cells finished
Begging forgiveness, calling that up top shit syphillis
You know what you was gettin into
Try to guess on what I've been through
Fuck shorty raw then she scared you


AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from the Wu, it's real
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from my crew, it's real


My nigga Chuck, he loved to fuck
Everything exotic bitches down to ugly ducks
Like Nancy, who liked the fancy tickles so he put popsicles
On her nipples to make her sex passion triple quadriple
Until she bust
Overcome with passion, big ass want lust upon him
But nigga he forsake to grab the condom
Fuck it, he said AIDS, was government made
To keep niggas afraid so they won't get laid no babies be made
And the black population will decrease within a decade
German warfare product against the dark shade


AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from my crew, it's real
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from the Wu, it's real


Caught by the gravitation earth rotation
Six in the sex is deep, when you can't see clear
Through the sheer brassiere, toke back
Smoking a spliff, sippin cognac, God
You know my two love songs, Bobby Womack tracks
Got her fat ass layin flat on her back


Yo, as she lay, she wore a silk gray neglige
Alize pours, the radio play, Marvin Gaye
What's Going On? As she screams Sexual Healing
Couldn't fight the feeling her legs hit the ceiling
Hitting all positions dipped in for quick love
She's professional, she does this shit in strip clubs
Flied in June until she Acquired Immune Deficiency
Now misery is the syndrome


Oh shit, God that's wild
Damn, that's some cherry flavor shit going on though kid
For real, knowhatI'msayin?
What about the exotic type
Caskets is waitin for brothers
Word up slide on the joints baby
Before you go to sex take protection
Word up

AIDS kills, word up respect this
America Is Dying Slowly (4x)

Yeah, word yo, sliding up in this store right here
I ain't even playing that man, for real
Dig it
Respect how I'm living kid
Here forever, word up
Lubricated joints, ribbed joints is bangin
But they still playing the hotel door man
Word, you know how that be though, you know how that be
Yo, just gettin to be too old
Chick over there lookin like Sonny and Cher
Over there
Yeah
America Is Dying Slowly
Surely
America Is Dying Slowly
America Is Dying Slowly

America Is Dying Slowly
Wu-Tang, Syndrome, be the resident

Noodles, Bobby Steels, Lou Diamonds, Killer Priest

Sunz of Man, Gambinos, forever...
Keep it safe!
Ol Dirt Schultz, word up baby
Protect yourself!
Keep it safe



Verse 1 : Bore Balboa

Uen u kafi sa devetkon , stavi pare na stol
Dobit u 50 000 ako domain zabije gol
Prestat u repat, ne da mi se vie
Uvik u svom filmu ka antwon fisher
Ovo sranje je tvrdo , tvre od dijamanta
Non stop dilan uto, zovu me fanta
Ako prednjai za respekt dobiti e po glavi
Mirien na novac, smrdin po travi
Prestali smo brojat pare,baci automate
Sad ih vaemo,100 kila eura,50 za me, 50 za te
Reci lavu da su kuje poele lajat plavcimat
Triba im zavezat jezike i drat ih na lancima
U konobi inox bilog,crnog i opola
Pien mafijake scenarije ka francis ford coppola
Svrbe me dlanovi, past e neka para
Pauci u stanu,past e suttra
Jauci u mraku, gansi u kvartu
Skansi u ministarstvu
Nosin parku u parku
Vozin terenca, u gepeku 20 kila kokaina
Svaki obrok, bar 100 grama proteina

Refren : Raekwon
Yo, Scarface gangstas, criminal niggas up in the trenches
Army coats on, playing the benches
Getting paper, sly, thats the motto, intelligent goons
Inside a hundred thousand dollar whip, follow

Verse 2 : Ghostface Killah
Yo, we in the back roasting marshmallows
Bottles of Krug
The dialogue is the big chain niggas is rude
Law library scholars, potatoes over the thirty-eights
With bald-heads, all live wires
Eleven homes, six trust funds, came home from doing a dime
We just left Uns, straight up
And we standing over the stoves, in denim Gibaurds
Brought a Dairy Queen to Queens right next to Lowes
IMAX Theatres
Astoria Waldorf
Philip Drummond suite, pretty young thing suckin' my balls off
Bubble baths, hash, zooted up, eyes closed
Silk drawers, fronting in my key-lime pie Wallo's
And I still got a half a ki indeed, Frank Lucas shit
Hid it in coffins, flying over seas
And if you ever try to ruin my knight
Ima make sure my best pawn put like three in your kite
Shot caller, laying in big lofts
Rock of Gibraltar, my pinky joint, killing like Orca
Daytime hawker, a nasty street author
Me, Rae and Rick, uzid out in the porches
Case we gotta Warner bro, like Malcolm-Jamal
Ima Falcon, Seven Mike Vick with the ball
Cause I can hut-one, hut-two, disrespect
I hunt you down
Aint a muthafuckin' crew we cant run through

Refren




A metal rock hit his face with a rush
They pistol-whipped him, shot him with his Dutch
He lost all his trust
Smoking Dutch, choking in his lust
Living out his lies, so one day he stole a pair of nuts
Tried to go hard, thats the wrong song
He shouldve just jetted, Moet in his mind up was wrong
He couldve made it but he waited, hesitated
Laying on a bitch, they caught him right in front of his Moms
They did him extra dirty, stripped him, tied his hands to his Vans
Them old school niggas left a victim
His blooded waist, broken arm, cut him in his face
I heard the chants, he dont deserve life, let him lamp
Choking him, poking him, hitting him with all kinds of knobs
Left him soaking, ?? all in his mouth
He was out, they broke him up, knocked him out
Three times then threw him in a slouch
They took his sneakers and his beeper
Wheres Theresa? Snatched the reefer
That bitch is next, catch you on the sequel
Swollen eyes, his face was pulverized
Trying to be a hustler, two ounces he want to mobilize
Dumb dummy, no team, he barely had money
Flying around, old ass Jag, buying blow from me
Ski mask robbing, jean wearing ho sweetass




Uh-huh, uh-huh, motherfucker, uh-huh
Yeah, I see that, I see that
All y'all fake motherfuckers up in the joint, huh
Stealin' my light, huh
Watch me, duke, watch me

Yo, check these up top murderers
Snowy in the bezel as the cloud merges
F.B.I. try and want word with this
Kid who pulled out bust a shot up in the Beacon
Catch me in the corner not speakin'
Crushed out heavenly, U.G. rock the sweet daddy long fox minks
Chicken and broccoli, Wally's look stink
He with his man straight from Raleigh Durham, he recognized Kojak
I slapped him five, Masta Killa cracked his Heini for him
Everybody break bread, huddle around
Guzzle that, I'm about to throw hair on your back
Since the face been revealed, game got real
Radio been gassing niggas, my imposters scream they're ill
I'm the inventor, '86 rhyming at the center
Debut '93 LP told you to enter
Punk faggot niggas stealing my light
Crawl up in the bed with grandma
Beneath the La-Z-Boy where you hid your knife
Ghost is back, stretch Cadillacs, fruit cocktails
Hit the shells at Paul's Pastry Rack
Walk with me like Dorothy try to judge these
Plus Degrees, sessical, rasta fiends
Getting waxed all through the drive-thru
Take the stand, throw my hand all on the Bible
And tell lies too, I'm the ultimate
Splash the Wolverine Razor Sharp ring, dolomite
Student enroll holding it


A-yo, this rap is like Ziti, facing me real TV
Crash at high speeds, strawberry kiwi
As we approach your hood, the Gods bail
See Staten Island ferryboat, cats bail
Fresh cellies, 50 deep up in the city
We banned for life, Apollo kids live to spit the real


A pair of bright phat yellow Air Max
Hit the racks, snatch 'em up, son, twenty dollars off no tax
Dream merchant tucked in the cloud, stay splurging
Rock a eagle head, 6-inch height was the bird
Monday night Dallas vs Jets, dudes slid in with one hand
Two Culture Ciphers, one bag of wet
Heavy rain fucked my kicks up
Wasn't looking, splashed in the puddle
Bitch laughing, first thought was beat the bitch up
Moseyed off gracefully, New York's most wanted cheeba hawk
Seen the yellow brick road, I stole the pastries
Same Ghostface, holy in the mind
Last seen Manhattan Chase
Withdrew the six-eight digit in the briefcase
Rawness, title is Hell-bound
Quick to reload around faces, surround look astound


We split a fair one, Poconos money
Gin rummy with glare, spot the lame, bit his ear
Yo, and taste a teaspoon, 300 goons, stash balloons
Locked in lab rooms, hit with the Glock, stashed in Grant's Tomb
Clocked him like a patient, his stocks fall, hustle invasion
Knowing now, we copped the block off, the chain tri-color
Freezing in velour, icicle galore
Gas station light gleaming on the wall
Cop WiseGuy jams, James Bond vans
Niggas flipped Timbs, rock boats under water, watch clams
Pose for the stand-off, mad timid
Hoping that the gun fall, guessing like lottery balls, yo






Just to let you know
Sometimes it takes a rainy day
Sometimes it takes a rainy day


A-yo, your skin color's the shit
Bubble when your back look delicious
My strawberry queen, Nestle quick, slide through Geneva
Switching gears on me, Imma leave her
She driving her own shit, she a keeper
Then clip jury on, live in the woods
Whats good? No Hollywood, whole shit, yeah, you good
Sipping drinks, rocking minks, come visit the shrink
Check crib, its bigger than Liv
What you think? Im just a part time romancer
See me in the club, Im a ransom
Time me up boo, I go against you and I queen that I want
She gotta think like a king, respect mine
Boo stay in line, do your thing and we can meditate, do yoga
Chilling on a sofa and my lofas
Youre making that bread, I play golf
Imma stare case baby with a train, vision it
I know Im living it with queen




I did you wrong cause I was fucked up lost
They caught me in the Porsche, go crying divorce
A-yo, my jury look tough, when you was sober their lost
And then you did this to me picture me cross
And you was never there when I was grinding and just flossing
And I had you in school like daddy be bossy
And now you wanna cry sober, it exhaust me
But keep the wheels right here, then jet to Georgia
Im a chief on em, no, no, noble extortion
Yeah, take it or leave it, acquire losses
She did this for capital to ball like a boss
So hold the fort down, protecting what's yours
Hey yo, no more remorse, cut endorsements
Fuck that, go back home, jet to Boston
Barking like a full grown pit, take caution
Im just wanting the shits, this is spot shit







I did everything that I said I would
Just in case I never had the time to
Asking God if you got me in his plans
In case things don't go as we planned to
I cheated death made it seem it never happened
Knew what I believed never had it tatted
What I was going through you couldn't fathom
But when you chasing greatness none of that ever matters
Set the pace my team watch our dreams come alive
Watched Soup make his move and Ren beat the odds
Never planned to survive, we plan to arrive
And what you did in ten years we handled in five
So watch what they all say now, I don't play what they all play now
In this life I'mma never lay down, treat the world like it's my playground
Had a foot in the grave no I never cried
When you make something timeless you could never die



It was all a dream, but I see it now
Used to be the prince, now I want the crown
Got the will to win, so it's going down
This is



Peace and quiet, no speaking I need it silent
Demons in my dreams so I won't sleep or ease my eyelids
I sick of always striving just for borderline surviving
I've been keeping to myself like I've been in hiding in confinement
It's me and the  family, vanity is causing my insanity
This is not the man I planned to be
A dollar and a dream, a couple grand is like a fantasy
All is fair in war, I can't plan on people sparing me, shit
This world is so cold, everybody plugged in, and ain't nobody got soul
They don't know they own bro, I'm doing as I wanna do and not how I've been told
And to me that more valuable than gold if you ain't know
It's the will to keep winning, the will to be different
I'm sticking to my vision even if nobody gets it
I gotta use my voice even if nobody listen
Cause I know that they gonna hear me in a minute



A-1 kosher, the chrome roadster
Son pulled up, heavy smacked flames out of his soldier
He wasn't dressed right, no vest
The war was supposed to pop, two weeks before the election
This is stressing the boss cause he might take a big loss
He used his voice to run the hood right, they shot up his whores
Lester was a well known investor, he lived in with Joyce
Her brother was connected, pa, he poisoned
Breaking china, stepping on glass
Juicy sweatsuits, her ass was lopsided, the bitch was just trash
One seed, La'tone Naeem, fourteen, he would walk mean
And grow up like the dad he never had, poor thing
No family morals, this is a small thing
But one day, he would get large and ball like Spalding
Take the hood by hood, I sat back and threw a couple jewels at him




Word, I miss you, I miss the God
Word... a powerful brother, man, he was live


He was a powerful general, the smell from his breath was Ballantine
I think it was the year '89
He stayed the freshest, Polo boots, wallies with them colorful 'Lo gooses
Coming from Medina, we boost
We up in A&S, slipping and dipping to Bedstuy
Native, he used to beatbox, thousands'll listen
Yo, that's before, the Wu got on, him and Allah Just'
And RZA came to the Island one morn'
A nigga could dance to slow music, outdrink any nigga
On the benches, while we hitting reefer, he sold loosies
Five foot seven, a legend was born, Russell 'Ason" Jones
I know him for his braids and lessons
A wise man with knowledge 120, kept a flag on his chest
A right hand, you quick, serving you Remy
Yo, let's toast to the fallen, lost forgotten
Aiyo, if niggas could hear me, then roll up some broccoli
Ason, the heart of a lion, a purified mind
The way he did it, with a mic and some wine
I would never forget the days we used to sit back
Days I be all up in the crib, listening, holding, align him and yo
I just miss this nigga
And now I understand the meaning of love, when I kissed the nigga


My name is Ol' Dirty Bastard, youknowhatimsayin?
I don't hide nothing back, I barely, I mean, I come from a family, man
Of poor welfare, youknowhatimsaying?
When I came out my mother's womb I was on welfare, youknowhatimsayin?
So so so it's like, you got to keep it real, nahwhatimean?


He had a heart of gold, intelligent soul from day one
Loud as the ferry, best friend was momma Cherry
Sweet lady, BK baby, she taught Dirty
How to cook, clean, singing the songs, say the
Old school dances and O.E., Ballantine, the wine
We sip, while we sat with the O.G.'s
Knowledge of self, good health
The fortunes that came with the game, had my brother insane
It's like wealth ain't enough to live for
But if you got love in your heart, just believe in yourself
That was the black man rap, baby Jesus in the black Land'
Few jewelry pieces with his gold fangs, his fam
(Brooklyn Zoo) you know my brother was ill
The first dude to say, "Yo, keep it real"
Yeah, the lover, the father, the hustler, the rap professor
Now he with Allah, that's a blessing


See, it's like, ok, where I come from
In my neighborhood, my people know me
Youknowhatimsaying? See, if I try to come any different
They ain't gon' respect me no more
Youknowhatimsaying? Because they -- you know people
Got their thing about themselves, you know
If you come from the neighborhood, youknowhatimsaying
You couldn't, you couldn't get out the neighborhood
But you could never take the neighborhood out of the people
Youknowhatimsaying, but if you try to like jump and crossover
To the other side, people won't understand that, and they don't like that
That's why they don't be buying people music
See, we keeps it real, and we always gon' keep it real
You can't knock what's real, youknowhatimsaying? We telling the truth, man




There's no coke
What?
You heard me you dumb fuck, there's no coke
What the fuck do you mean there's no coke?
I've been up and down this ship
I've been in every fucking room
There's gotta be coke
There is nothing, nothing

*heavy panting*
Help PLEASE!
*panting continues*
Help me!
*gunshot*


It's assassination day, I stalk


I move through the Third World, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I live's a 25 to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
Cream is short, Cee Cipher Power stalk, plus the fiend talk
3 Gs the cost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen goal but it fail
Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter
Devil's poisoning the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened
Trapped in deep water, gasping
I clash with the titans for my half on the action


I stop producers careers, the weak spot was the ears
Scorpion darts hits the mark, pierce the heart with silver spears
You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still feel this so you're living build tilted
MCs upon their axis, their body hazard tactic
Lactic acid, desert dry cactus, practice
You can never match this invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice
The mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches
Unforgivable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects more livable
Interchangeable, caution: flammable
My chamber is 99 plus 1  unnameable angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
We creep through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare


First of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don
Spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurging, merging in the suburbs
Using this just like an adverb, action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aiming like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pa
You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Holding like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high, yo Bobby
You hear how I'm shooting it like they blue tops
No, you won't play me like your lady
Pay me 380, spit it at you like a baby, final destination Haiti


War's extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take things to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MCs to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue death than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in
Murderous rhyming, constantly inclining
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain then absorbs the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback






Let's do this shit, man
Word up, let me get this dutch out
Yo look, stupid motherfucka got bagged across the street, look at him
He a fucking clown, I told that nigga, man, damn, man


Ayo, son a asshole, he just got bagged
Tried to fuckin' tell a nigga, yo, he just laughed, I smoked me a bag
I felt bad, but yo, I had still had to call up his dad
Yo dun, your son got rocked with thirty one cracks, he just spazzed
Dropped his corn beef hash, call granny up
Actin' like he hear me, "Yo Rae, call us a cab"
You mad, you not getting me to go with your ass
Trying to walk up in the preacher with your smoked out ass
We got there, nigga scratching his beard, yeah
You got it from here, I'm airin', I won't be the victim you flash
Picture this shit, this dumb ass
Get to pointin' niggas out, talkin' whoomp, whoomp, whoomp, I blow past
White cops staring at me, by then, they threw the fare at me
I was just a dare, Mr. Woods, ear tapped me
Yo, holla at me, Priest surrounded me, then popped collars at me
I was on some bullshit, laughing
Questionin' the size of me, shorty, pop singin' like the Isley
He all high, and his eyes won't lie to me
Yo ride with me, yo, you wildin'
Cops is on the floor out of it, I'm like a child in a robbery
Yeah nigga, popping your shit, keep poppin' your lip
That little white crust, fell off his fit
You just an asshole, fuck you Rae, fuck all them niggas in the building

Not the frame, Rae, analyze the picture, you'se a bitch nigga
Your son, your life, they all gon' get ya
Let's talk business for what? Get off them niggas
They don't respect you, I'm the cat paying ya bitches


Niggas that be snitchin' on the block, kid
Son, you gotta just be watch your move
Niggas don't be having no respect, kid
The'll try to knock you off, off
Taking it right to your mom's apartment
Jumping out on the front of your whip
So many niggas all in your business
Now the system on your dick, quick




Yeah, this your brother Raekwon right here
Rozay special, what up?
Fourth floor, no doubt, corridor
It's filled with all kinda whores
(Maybach Music)


So addictive, so addictive
I'm addicted to V-12 Benzes
The rush of audio meth it comes instant
Every breath I take I'm paid interest
So addictive, so addictive
I'm addicted, canary yellow diamonds
Chinese AK's that shoot silent
Most gangstas choose to die violent


Diamond'd up Eagle G, diesel weed slingin' needles
Heroin drawn from my cerebral
Paint artist, lace you with scars, and tarnish everythin' on you
Take you out your jewels, now undress
New York savages, hunt scavenges
Son, get his address, mac and a Jag, the nigga asked for this
Play low, my killas, they say go
Catch him in snake mode, bite him, then jump in a gray boat
Dope verse fresh in the blow store, comin' out heat first
So when we meet, it's a deep thirst
Winners take winners, we invest
Keep it on the up and up, just like Khaled, we the best, nigga


So addictive, so addictive
I'm addicted to V-12 Benzes
The rush of audio meth it comes instant
Every breath I take I'm paid interest
So addictive, so addictive
I'm addicted, canary yellow diamonds
Chinese AK's that shoot silent
Most gangstas choose to die violent


The Maybach parallel, seats caramel
Fly as airmail, Killa Beez parasail
The luger black, the brick white
The boy brown, good night
Coupe red, streets dark
Scare snakes out the grass when the tree spark
Backwoods, no white boys
Movin' white? Better look out for them white boys
Got a white Beamer,got a white six
White man's world, can suck a big black dick
Got a nigga down the street down to murder somethin'
Couldn't have nothin', shit now he work or somethin'


So addictive, so addictive
I'm addicted to V-12 Benzes
The rush of audio meth it comes instant
Every breath I take I'm paid interest
So addictive, so addictive
I'm addicted, canary yellow diamonds
Chinese AK's that shoot silent
Most gangstas choose to die violent
So addictive, so addictive
I'm addicted to V-12 Benzes
The rush of audio meth it comes instant
Every breath I take I'm paid interest
So addictive, so addictive
I'm addicted, canary yellow diamonds
Chinese AK's that shoot silent
Most gangstas choose to die violent




Word up. La The Dark' and Chef
(True, let's get it right.)
Aiyyo. Fourth
(Let's get it right like white.)
Burning that ass. Sniff it up
(You know how we go, kid.)
Like a hound on dope
(Yeah. Yeah.)
Word. Word life. La The Dark'
Big up to my many Buck-Buck
Don't sweat that
(What up, son.)
It's all good
(Check it. Check it.)


Yo, yo, yo, yo
Aiyyo La, what's up son
Aiyyo, you read the papers
2 Columbian niggas hit these moneymakers
A heavy routine, Chevy, Yukon green
Had crazy coke up in that piece by all means


The kids was mad flonting, Rae', it had to go down
Killers be coming for your neck, when you wearing a crown
4-5's and AK's, kids ready to spray
The cats got nine lives from around my way
Timb boots and overlord, two techs by the door
So, when the po-po come, I can take them to war


Same subject, techs and royalty checks
Plus marketing the drugs, equal mad respect
I gotta get mine, blast mad nines on a regular
Fake competitor or player,will meet his maker


Who's the rap mayor, it's me, I be the slayer
The dark's in the realm, you contemplate your prayers
Meteorite of clips hitting in the 9-5th
All you yapping MC's, like pancakes you get flipped
I got a thirty shot clip at the grip of the hip
A mad av. warrior, young tale from the crypt, kid

 (x2)
As the world goes round yo the same is the same
(Same junkies on the corners shooting shit in their vein)
But still, black man must rise up to the top
(Representing Darkman with this real hip hop)


And you don't stop (and you don't stop)
Yeah! (and you can't stop) and you can't stop
(Word up! word drop that style)


You only live once, execute your dreams
A third real triple beam, weighed out my scheme
For the cream, I sold cracks, never could relax
Now build with Wu-Tang, spitting lyrical facts
Young black mad bastard from the concrete street
And I never leave the land without strapping my heat
Keep peace and don't beef, word life Tariq
I stole the million dollar show cause I'm that dark thief
Part Dark part spark, ready to rip you apart
I was born with a gold shield over my heart
So, don't start none, it won't be none
I'm dominating the screen, my reign just begun
I got raw and uncut for the kids doing bids
You can't figure my physical like a pyramid
I'm that wicked dark star, may La now rise
I switch to warp space 5 like the Starship Enterprise






Light is shinin.. beauty sunshine
Here comes one-time.. the ball was so fine
Heat is blazin.. the kids were playin
His partner was shady.. tryin to save the babies


A-yo, they didn't know the cop was crooked
He had blow out in Brooklyn
All this while he let the fiends cook it
The baseheads stirred it up, plus they got to blow it up
Dropped it off in the PJ's and they bigged it up
Then one day, shit jumped off real crazy
The middle of a bathroom they find an old lady
No clothes, half of her tongue, ear missin
The killer had to be mad smart, he wore mittens
Even though her leg was bitten
Crackheads point the finger at Detective Slick Morris Gittins
Paleface cop who done popped the best
And got the chop on his neck from when he knocked Celeste
It was a slug, drug, he pressured everybody on the block
Some niggas know him as the Godson of Gotti
And his black partner, he was scared to speak
He saw how they planted weapons on these kids in the street
He saw like over fifty bodies in like fifty-two weeks
He saw his colleague pick up money before leavin his beat
They call him desk duty, Robocop
Younger dudes call him Freddy Krugs from the way he walk on the block




Heard the disturbance out the window, oh shit they got my son
Pulled over his Tempo, Brenda dropped the endo
Had her little nephew with her yo she didn't care
They always harassed her, until she blew the captain with a razor
His partner turned red in his waist, maced her, smacked her
With the walkie, yoked her then slammed her on her face
He bugged on her like she was drugged, plugged one in her
The fifth relaxed her like a big thug pistol whipped her
Heard she was dusted, must've been the way they threw the cuffs on her
She broke the shits, went and rushed the kid
Wavin her hands, she had a half an axe, all in her tracks
He grabbed her by the hair, she broke his jaw it cracked
More cops arrived, they both bloodied down by the five
Wildest niggas just smilin cause it look live
They gave her forty years in New Orleans, callin me wodie
Shorty was young, by three days had a great bid




You're just worms in the worst part of the apple that's rotten
You squirm and you turn from the right, still plottin
All slimy cause you stay grimy, petty crimey cat
You sometime me, don't need to remind me about
Livin in the core, with the scramblers in front of the store
The bum holdin the door, the mugging no one saw
We played ball in the alley where dope was shot raw
And the school they kept flawed, plus the lowest test scores
Small percentage determined to strengthen they position
Transformation from critical to, stable condition
But it still be obstacles on niggas that's optical
Watchin you like salt-water sharks that's tropical
The money was the root and it's the instinct to make it
With they pockets and fridge naked, many aim to take it
Whether - hold up, set up, stabbin or a wet up
Just to know it was the kid next door fizzucked your head up
Once he fell short, frequently visit the courts
And for some, another way out, is music and sports
That's why I, keep the rhyme just as fly as a shot
That won the championship, with just oh on the clock

 - repeat 2X



"It's true - the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang, could be dangerous!"


Uh-huh, Mr. Biggs, Trackmasters (woo!)
It's a Wu-Tang official right here y'know


Yeah, the employees of the year yeah we're back to work
We took time off, while other rappers got jerked
Shit's bout to change now, it's a shame how
Things ain't the same but I'm back in the game now
And as we step in the door, we cause panic
Yep, the usual suspects, we at it
Vet status, y'all went a week with the belt
Few chicks felt your style, now you feelin yourself
Meet your maker, I dropped you at eight years old
I got stock in your flow and crops to sharehold
Crops with the prose where cops won't dare go
Got top centerfolds too hot to wear clothes
Still me - always have and will be
Ill G - it's silly to hate but feel free
Hey - hear what I say, they gotta pay
And my return is like Christ, declare the holiday


Back in the game now.. copped me some weed now
My people bout to eat now.. shit's bout to change now
Back in the game now.. all my niggas in the hood now
Better catch up now.. shit's bout to change now


Uh, y'all see I'm in the street strugglin
Young dumb and thuggin, give a FUCK about nuttin
Stuck at rock bottom, tryin to come up on somethin
Pumpin from sundown to sun-up, we hustlin
Vision my nigga now get in where you fit in
And see prison, as just the high cost of livin the life
Ante up cause if you blow the dice
On that O-Z, Dorothy ain't goin home tonight
That's on e'rythang, put it on the kids and the wife
Been buryin my folks ever since they raised the price on the coke
Searchin for a quick antidote
Mo' money, mo' problems to cope


We were at the same table when the chips were checked
A gamblin +Rebel+ who +Inspects+ the +Deck+
Just when you thought we would fold our hand
Against all odds we raised the bet like we changed the plans
It was live on air but in between station breaks
I was holdin a pair and just made the table stakes
Split the demos, put insurance on tapes
A safeguard against the crusaders in capes
If I double down they say the Gods are sharks
If we win against the house they thought the cards was marked
We draw hit after hit from a royal flush menu
While the dealer promoted the full house venue
A spade in the club with the heart to wear diamonds
The high roller who got credit upon signin
They look puzzled when I shuffle, most of 'em stunned by the hustle
Recourse of bluff game's your muscle

 - 0.75X
 Say what? ("Shaolin shadowboxing!")
 Shit's bout to change..


Aiyyo, on rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich, coolin with a mean ill Jamaican bitch
Banana coat matchin with the ratchet
Lil' black weave sweatpants style, air force is actin
Jump in the 6, kicks look crisp, talkin bout the bird
Flow through your hood in the mean tints that's giant
It's like the family that flipped on you for lyin
Buried you alive, left your whore cryin
We on your floor look more doors
Dey ain't ate either, I hope y'all niggas is armed
And when we get there, all my niggas in the mix
Yeah Shallah Lex, Diamond got me buyin Louis Rich wear


Most people say the Clan was missin since I got dropped offa radio
Overnight your whole style was bitten in the process
Everybody switched they names like
Whatcha call it, any fast (?)
It was the Gods that repped that, sharkskin dark skinned bitches
Clarks from Digi left the game dizzy
Ooh got busy, that dancey shit slid through
We had to stay hood cause that's who we been through
RZA came through, mastermind got the cash and power
Proof that power plastered divine classical lines
Mathematical rhymes, the style is unbearable
Now niggas with the radical shines
It's Ghost-Deini, every coast need me
We back motherfucker that's right, it's the W.T.C
World Trade Center, Wu-Tang Clan
We brought so much heat that we was givin you tans an' shit



{*Ron Isley ad libs to fade*}

Smack that emesole, wanna diss soul principals, blaow, blaow, ghetto lynchable

Bust guns for fun, under the sun, it's a ritual
Third eye visual, forseein' the critical
Fake mic fiends, ready to smitherins, it's pitiful

Blow your game out the frame, thinkin' they kissin' you
Bitch ass niggas, I owe you niggas nothin', what you got your hands out for

Playin' my square; talk halves only; bitch, eat a pickle
I'm melted up with Guess jeans, Champion sweat hood on
Philadelphy hat; two  blings
The Aston is dynamite red
Double-pipin' with the wrist lightning white
I shit on the hoodlings
All we hold is pedico and Eagles, Diesel weed
This time, I'm a shit rhymin' for kilos, yo
Who dare wan' test us? I flip the accent like Jamaicans
Kid, one stare, we shot your peoples

Bugged out, Bugs-Bunny-money niggas
Plus my hands is licensed; that's right, shoot up some dummies
Dare niggas; it's gon' be hell up in everywhere, when we find you
Plus we chopped off your mother hands..


And packaged it up, and then mailed it to your brother's house
We want that coke, nigga, every last fuckin' ounce
You fuckin' with the wrong team; I'll blow meat off your shoulders
Got more than just thugs, I pack heat in my Crown holders
Louie Vuitton Wallos, keep a ox in the gummy sole
Chain so big, nigga, it look like dummy gold
You funny, though; fuckin' with some savage my niggas
That'll kill when it comes to six O's in the figure
Gun clappin', have 'em ready to bust they triggers
You's a goner, gonna find you slumped in the river
With a Cuban Link purple tape stuck in your face
I'm a ghost, choked out, no prints to trace
No leads in the case, got a secret identity
Throw loose change in the game, son, peep the documentary
I know ya'll motherfuckers like the back of my hand
Fuck around with big Ton' and get stomped by the Clan, asshole!




Yeah, yeah, just dropped that Lost Jewelry too, man

Ayo, ayo


Liquor all in his he ready to fuck somethin'
Up in the Bentley truck rollin' a blunt, stuntin'
The trainers right there is a G
Had the neck game for free, sweats on, Rolex for me
I like the sex cause, give 'em jaw suggestions
Drunk in a penthouse with drawers on, excellent
Listenin' to Commodores, blue magic, holdin' a new clapper
I shot the masseuse, who tappin' her?
A whole lot of character, check out the big man
Jewellery game hardheaded, check it in this land
I got the seeds with me, plead with me
Don't wanna catch no bodies, don't dis me, believe in me
Up in the Ritz high as Hell
Kicks cost twenty-seven hundred, them shits came with bells
I'm more flash than the president
So ether your favorite rapper - he can wear the suit while I black up
At last meet the greatest, his clique Canadians
Look around, yo, and keep debating, huh?
Money bags, we rock the certified
Word from the murder guys who don't fuck around but burglarize
Tax bracket is ill, shout out thankfully
I've got a fish tank that's spanky, thank for me
Hundred floors up, the doors, it ain't no key
Put your finger on the angle and blink to me
Yeah, relay, he in concernt, holding' it down, sir
That's Wu in the flesh, he a monster


How can I love somebody else
If I can't love myself enough to know?
When it's time, time to let go...
Sing...


All I really want is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet


I ask for the sign from the sweet Lord above
I know the answer is in front of me
But when you think you're in love
You only see what you wanna see
And all I see is me for you
And you for me
Oh I cannot hide the way I feel inside
(No I don't know why)
I don't know why but every day I wanna cry
If I give you one more try
To there rules, will you abide
And if I mean anything to you
Would it make everything all right?




I just wanna be so, so, happy
But the answer lies in me
I do believe that we can be happy
I said I wanna be happy, yeah, yeah...


Life is too short to be tryin' to play some games
Now take some time and think about
If it's really worth losing me
Why must it be this way?
Why do you have to play with my mind?
All the time...
Help me sing it
All I really want is for me to be happy
Oh, just help me sing it
All I really want is for me to be happy
Yeah...
All I really want is for me to be happy
Oh, you know I wanna be happy, yeah, yeah


I don't wanna have to worry about nothin' no more

I mean, it'll be alright with me
Won't you help me sing? Just help me sing, yeah

Aucun problme
Dans la rue ma pute charge  bloc se prostitue pour moi
T'entends Booba ?
Dans la rue ou dans l'industrie le Roi Heenok est poids lourd
T'entends Booba ?
Tu es dans la mme catgorie que De la Hoya
Je te donne au moins cela
Mais d'imiter les ngros du Queens
Camoufl sur du verlan et un accent arabe
N'est pas suffisant
Tes clients sont insatisfaits et ils veulent des vrais
Mais t'inquite, ton rve s'est ralis :
Le Roi Heenok, le rap franais officiel du Queens
Excut par des ngros de la Rive Sud
Des super-hommes
Qui s'expriment en plusieurs langues, et qui profitent de la drogue
Qu'importent et exportent l'hydroponique et des tonnes de briques
Du Qubec  Paname
Booba : bel emballage sans le contenu
Rien  cirer que tu sois sur l'tiquette de AZ
Ou avec qui t'as dj collabor
Rien  respecter que tu aies laiss tomber Ali et le 45 Scientific
Pendant qu'ils aident la cause en Palestine
Que les vrais ngros font les vraies choses, jusqu'au Qubec
Au concert de Mobb Deep, suspect, sur leur pnis
Ayant la frousse de rencontrer Havoc avec ta chaine et ton mdaillon
Bien camoufls
A l'intrieur de ton t-shirt
Cachs du regard des gangsters, tatou comme un tueur
Faux voyou on t'a  l'oeil
Performant sur scne pour des Blancs de moins de 18 ans
Drespectant ton ancien clan (Raekwon: Word up !)
Pendant qu'ma popularit grandit dans l'92i
(Raekwon: Know what I mean?)


Dgaine mon arme
Tiens mon fusil, tire avec mon fusil
Les ngros de la Rive Sud sont ops

Drugs, villains, murder
Your wig'll fly right off from your crib
It's all true talking
We kill niggas like you hawking
Put your hand on my stack I saw shit
Chop arms off of snakes, leave em dead on fire escapes
You tryna wile out? Fryin apes
Ballin niggas in pits, makin niggas sniff white dust
All of this is based on bricks
True scenario, bury niggas on home terrio
Black shit, cruise through nothing but strapped shit
????? of rap, gangsta rooms in the four building, fantastic
War platoon, this is Lex the check writer
The shit I sell ?????, don't come sideways with that
Animal thug murderer nigga, rats in his casket
Goldchurch 21 karats in Paris
Heat pop, check the raw section of the street Ak
This is Chef




Yeah, uh-huh, yo, yo


Portable DATs, Sony headphones
El Dorado's, thousand dollar bottles, get blown
Diplomat Willie's, Millie Jackson chicks, dusted out Blondie
Slide me, we wrote the bowl, we take the magnets
Man handling mics, wool scarves, Evil Knievel bikes, I like eggs in my rice
Circus money, read the Staten Island funnies
Eighty seven, Shallah rock, lotto's and the gumby
Tri-boro, fly negro, rap for Glaciers
Do it for cee-lo games, cases, battle for bitches
Million dollar cribs, grandfather gamble those wit ribs, yes he did
Life is wonderful, fly living rooms, brass brooms
Catch me in the city of Watts, dusted out with Doc Doom
Slide you, thirty six to the hip, you need Neo
Sock it to me G.O., the block we spot V.O
Live at the handball session, white Wimbledon's
Send them, my throat is the top session for men
Rap graduate, seen through the needles that was used by dopes
Fuck around and get rocked for three notes
And fuck your bitch ass alligators
When I see you on stage, throw out the gauge, my man's dough made us


Aiyo, elephant guns, mad ounces, colorful whips
Slapped up bouncers, pouches
Ball like a unit, fly fragrance, faceless
Rarely out of spaceships, many fakes got lynched
We all pornographic, taylor made mortals
Leanin' on suede walls, leather's on, ballers
Maybe Benz lenses, sprayin' out of sixes, Christmas money
Vicious consolidated drama rip bitches
The rich version of black, skyscraper paper
Wu belt makers, show & prove that all my shit match
Tri-colored diamonds, foreign color five
All kinds of iron, Swiss cheese, yea, big boy, we giants




I went to jail over hard crack
Then made a mill off of hard rap
I'm trying to feel what's beyond that
So I put my faith all in God's lap
I was lost, couldn't find me
So how the fuck I end up in Ferraris
Just a young nigga in Huaraches
Now champagne spill on my Versaces
Buzzing off these alcoholic beverages
Passed out barely know what day it is
Running but the pain coming quicker
That's why I put my life at the hands of these strippers
Think the devil in disguise
Swear I looked the devil in his eyes
I walked through hell and survived
Then I found heaven right between her thighs
Tell these niggas I'm a rider
In the courtroom drunk, finger to your honor
Started from the bottom, had to battle with pirhannas
Now it's Sunset Strip salad at Katana
Handcuffed to a cell for old warrants
Bailed out now it's back to world touring
Fast cars, party hard the same living
Wake up in hotels with strange women


If you think tomorrow won't come
Heavy on the streets like I weigh ten tons
Chasing this money for the paper I run
I could tell these niggas ain't on we on
Homey you can bet that
Yeah homey you can bet that


I brought killers to my dinner table
Then brought dinner to the dealers' table
Hard to breathe when I'm killing space shoes
Staring down the barrel tell me who you pray to
Caught up in the moment hope I see tomorrow
'Til it's over tell that waitress bring us 20 bottles
Trying to tell these kids find a dream to follow
Don't follow me I'm caught up in caucasian models
Swimming in these bitches off of television
Condominiums with elevators in 'em
Coming from the ghetto that's a hell a way to live it
Bitches see the lights, diamonds hella dripping
Caught up in the life I'm trying to make better choices
Pack street sweepers in back of the Rolls Royces
Nightmares waking up screaming I'm hearing voices
Spinning right back into jail with all my poisons




Yo, yo what up yo God body is hard body
Flying through the hood in Maseratis and large bodies
Moving through the town and  papi
Gangstas and God got me
One man can take down the fam copy
Sysco in my glass, learn how to hustle, rock and rustle
In front of the children throwing cash
Neighbors ain't like that
He kept flexing on us young
Old ass  and we dyslexian
What it did, new fly crib
New bank book, new ratchet, new whip
New flip, new bitch, new kicks
Two to three bricks, few trips
You speakin' fly niggas see the dicks
Yup, we all bezeling up
Battle any creature bring your casualties up
And ain't nothing moving but the money what
Don't get stuck






We used to do the smurf together and bump
Hit Macys up and do {?} all down in the trunk
Aligator blazers and three fingers, playing the boat
Holding that thang, you holding my mans
Like a westside flick with a fly shorty
A bunch of young live niggas want you but their money is corny
What it do lady' Kiss your man hand and let him through sweetie
Watch it, she got a man, it's the remix


Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't deal nothing overnight
Cuz a love like this takes some time
People start off as a phase
Said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom
They see that we did that (yes)
It's so true that (yes)
We've been through it (yes)
We got real (cencored) (yes)
See baby we been


Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home (cus I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby


I got a question for ya
See I already know the answer
But still I wanna ask you
Would you lie' (no)
Make me cry' (no)
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is only your love (yes)
I'll be faithful (yes)
I'm for real (yes)
And with us you'll always know the deal
We've been




Ayo I heard you in the hood like Hilary
Expensive boots and bags, bullets holding mad artillary
I been seen it coming like an all red, this was the date
Your whip change cus you wanna be more {?}
I blessed you with half my tolernace
Copped you the R5 and you went and crashed it up for following
And yeah, you let dons be dons
The chemistry so sincere, I'mma show and prove it's on
Fuck hanging, I need luck slangin
Plus when you got a real nigga in the cut, what, that's bangin
Kissing your head, getting bread, trying to avoid plagues
Chilling at your momma's crib, kissing they boy legs
Cus when I ain't home, you holding it
If love got it fucked up, tell the truth, ma you stole it
And don't take it personal lady, cus I can't (be without you baby)

One tough challenge, rough 'em up, bring out his raw talents
Money maker, send them to us

I want you to tell them
Statik Selektah


Lets do this man for real
We smoke big blunts, cigars, it's us
It's obvious, kids, we regulate up shit moving through brush
The beats is grim, the ambiance plush
The speaker won't bang, the sneaker won't lust
Snitches wish dead, the eagle gon' bust
Catch you in the wrong spot, you dust
Statik ill, bring the havoc, this is magic
Fake niggas flee out, fly out the mouth, I get you gatted
Sports cars, reendorsed yards
Everybody four stars, Rae like forty, jewelry gaudy
Your creature game corny, I eat your dame, you hop up on me
Head off the rip, grab the whip, rest maturely
Hanging around the vets in the sweats
Since '97 we was rolex-ing the extra
Fuck around a hundred Tecs flash
Flex, cash, drugs, money and sex
Dumb check smashing


Watching the game from a bird's eye view
They say it's hard to keep trust so my third eye grew
Chakras open, binocular scoping, sour smoking
Hoping my best buds ain't only in it for the tokens
Cause they say it's who you joking with, tokin' potent with
Tag team and strokin' chicks, the ones that do some bogus shit
Act cool on the strip, but want to put two on your hip
Macking jewels in your whips, booming your hits, screwing your bitch
Froze under my toes, bitches where my penis is
Kicking it since the womb, now you see what the fetus is
And what the fetus is? Would these niggas feed us shit?
Rob a nigga for his number 2's to put my feet in, shit
Flow slippery, rise to the tippity top
I'mma make hot drops, make snakes history
Dreams of living civilly in Sicily
Laughing with a fan like


It's the elephant in the room
Created by a collision of the sun and the moon
My sonogram was an image of a gun in the womb
That was soon to be doper than heroin in a spoon
I'm astonishing, honestly my future looking promising
As my skin tone and a crystal clean onyx is
Darker thoughts let the beats break like a Amish's
I'm a stroke of genius like Mickalene Thomas is
Hip-hop and body rocking and doing it dude
I am the living definition of improving the groove
I use the same tools to shoot that Kubrick used
Take your hero to the river, give them two b-rick shoes
Who lose? If you really ain't nobody till somebody love you
I say you ain't nobody til they speaking highly of you
And what I'm sure you wouldn't want is any kind of trouble
Unless you got a crash dummy or a body double
You got a couple homies down to catch a homi- for you
Well I'mma fold niggas into origami for you
The most notorious, Poet Laureate
Whole story is glorious, stoic warriors
And I got my eyes wide open on you quasi-
Haters still smirking like the gators on an Izod
Lacoste, y'all tomato head niggas are
Imposters, long drawn out process
Triple OG's got a worn out conscience
Reminiscing to when we was all out monsters, on
Our Sierra Leone reigning tyranny
I strike fear in their hearts, rappers stear clear of me
Black Sankofa, Ayatollah, Range Rover, games over
Bill folder, give niggas that Ebola virus
Huh? You got me chopped like Miley Cyrus
Naw, I'm on your block with Somali pirates


For real man Statik man, what's good?
Yeah you know I gets it on
I ain't playin', I'm truly the worst
I was born about that

Raw like fuck kid, represent

Half animal, whole lotta love, black God

Grip the splinter, shoot it sideways, nozzle on, pip-it
Ready to hit somethin, pop shit wit somethin
Blow blimps on the mad rubber grips, big lips on it
Rollin wit top rank medals, hands is like Greg Neddles
Bright link, purple heart, swim bezzle

Trash, three hundred thousand in cash, guerilla mash
Brass this gat, TNT niggas on my ass
Play for real, Lex will, I suggest still
Clear my own shit, let the press ill, let's bill
Make it to the UN, doin bout a thousand in the blue Em
Frogmen, repped out cluein
Left all the American Express cards
Left the passports, time shit, shit up on in Escort
Bail 'em, bustin his joint, Chief O'Heara
That old, Louis McDarren, see the waves through the mirror
Spot that, hop that, through the top back
Ready to lock somethin, down for the cause, stop that
You play the king, I play the pawn, who the king of the Swarm
You wrong, where's the evidence, watch the firearm
Where a tunnel of fans stand, I knew I had little bits of love
Hopin it'll be fair, he watch me, heavy roxy scene
He clean though, American Cream Team let him leave
See the moral of the story, feelin me like
Mordon and Glory when they came for me
Had fifty on the line, look at mine, all dressed down
Handlin lines, know the time






Burn something kid


Yeah, youknowwhatImsaying, let me tell you something man
Through the man's mind, God
He see his elevation, God
See through his mind, he see his elevation, God
See this where he begin to know that where he come from
See some people don't have no direction, God
Because they don't know the science of they self
See the signs of life is the signs of you
All the elements that it took to create you
Everything that's in the universe, God
That's created the universe, God, is just within you
You see what I'm sayin?
And that's the mind that you can't see
Don't you know if a man could take and flip himself inside out, God
He'll fall out and die if he sees the shit that goes on...inside?


So you mean to tell me I'm the creator of all this right here?


You the creator of all this
Because all these things must happen, it must take place
See people go back in the day, God
They say: one man, one woman, Adam and Eve, there ain't no such thing
Everything you see always has been and always will what be
Regardless the womb or what, it's got to be


Hit me, hit me, hit me, I don't wanna hear nothin
Word Up
Got to pay
Yeah, it's like that right?
Blow his back out, make his shoes worth


A-yo, this shit be off the noggin rock it
Whatever cock block it
Cat get blown, who own this street corner
Foreigner hesitate to rock a Hummer
Navy Seal top runner, rhyme this summer
For real, marinating nigga's skating
Debating waiting style flowingly relating
Fine line switch it on ya, like venetian blinds
The mission is mine, fabulous king I divine
Titanium Hydro collide though
Yo dun dun polly this conjunction, son one
Slang doctor, medicated kids pay it
Say it, these niggas in affect dun, stay rap related
Cassette rhymer, 5-G consigner, line for liner
Poet designer, sharp like Linus
Mic of the year award, fly gear award
Them niggas over there be analyzing with one sword
Get bent, pay the rent, plus still we invent
Nuff shit to get your whole team crazily sent
Now all I need is a half gallon of weed
Proceed, to bust this mic dick and make three seeds
Then max out like two Ac's inside the parking lot
Son bark a lot and get his team hit in the dark a lot
What now blow, clicking like a calico
Gold, Maximillion, one love keep it real yo


Yo, hit me for these Tommy Hill, ice-rocking niggas
Peace, this summer's mines, I blow the biggest
Back up off me, while I grab my dick and hold the Heini
Park the Blue 600, Wally kings is right behind me
Tackle clubs, never rock Lugz, I'm way above
These mics is like the Golden Gloves verses spark plug
Its like the pennant, seminar's the play-off
Start the J off like Cochran got OJ off
This specialist who eyeballed your mistress necklace
Perpetuous, this curly-head kid's treacherous
Let go the eggo, so we can dip dip dive like Lego
Throw on can-can, eat that plus this instrumental
Ah shit say Stark-ologist
Starks-ologist, fried fish halibut
Pull out the bull horn, let's celebrate like Kunta was born
We elbowed our way inside Loud and got on
I played the building, burn a branch and get filled in
Like Pilgrims G-in' Pepridge farms from out of millions
Who wanna rhyme, who wanna challenge the swordmans
That rock that fisherman hat like Gorton's


I hold down the place, no shots to the face
Elite Special force no religious style faith
The melting pot boil gun shot drama soil
Gamble when I scramble handle hot pots of oil
Manhandle pain killing erect my hidden
Streets made me potent put your 9-6 bid in
Vampire curse disperse on each verse
Swim in black water, act slaughter through my earth
You're hit by my element Great Wall of China
Mountain peak holds the globe like vagina
Measure on my mic stand, molecule and strand
Finger rolling rhythm ride the horse one hand
Golden Eye, Spy vs. Spy, guilty of suspicion
Chess boxer, mic in dead body position
40 oz. Ciga-art, three verse invention
Divine universal black man representing
Similar to pure, rhyme blowing out the pore
Battery in the back, keep me charged for the raw
I'm bred type thorough, pistolero gun hero
Renaissance rebel chatter-boxing your barrel
Fully woven Beethoven, hit you on a humble
Hard enough to hurt you, chastise my rap styles
Lock down, for this curfew




*sounds of fighting*
Stupid fool, you're forcing me to kill you!


Yeah, you know how it go
Fresh from the stationary hall of justice
Real rhyming, real movement, real life
Word up, we just chilling, ten bottles of Krug on the wall
Youknowhatimsaying? Straight up, for real
Yo, RZA, talk to these niggas, man, let's go, man, for real
Yo, Rah, what up? Let's go, yeah, gangsta shit, groovy shit
Raw shit, secret indictment shit, yeah
Secret indictments, be careful, niggas
For real, let's go


You better get that money, no matter, what you do
You gotta get that money, and represent your crew
And keep it true


As reaper stay sprayed, still niggas is smoked
Four in his pocket, a diamoned up chain and some coke
Champion hood, the goodies in a brown bag, by the radiator
Near the cookies and the bundles of dope
Fishscalers, I live in elevators and gross
All this paper, profit make her lay there and post
With them Adidas that Bruce wore, stay in the juice bar
All I know if you saw me, you thought I was broke
Black, yo, I been hustling since niggas was busting guns
And scuffling, and jumping niggas over some coats
We play the S&S rooftop, Latin Quarter, Polo popes
Who hung out with all the Eighthers and GOAT's




Yo RZA, you crazy man
This that Black Mozart shit, right here


Yo, I used to scramble hard, radio strapped, to the handlebars
Fifty deep, in the lobby large, rocking camouflage
Dark Caesar holding my nuts, played the building front
Fifth of Henny, throw a little snow in the blunt
Just growing up, schooled by O.G.'s, holding O's and up
Daily new drama unfold, they popped 'em over, what?
It's so rough, nobody know him, so what?
Aiyo, the money's close by, homey, show me the stuff
Borough hopping, copping bricks, bags, burners and kicks
City slickers, circling the strip, working them tricks
Like friday night cruise in the Coupe, new valor suit
Fruit flavored kicks, taking flicks out in 40 Deuce
Farmer jeans, hammer swing, tucked in the loot
How they hit Miss Fisher, they was busting at suit
Up in 54, underground, parrot and Q
Made man with the grey shams, wrapping the boo
Stay flam, every day, fam, stacking my loot
Eighty grams in the cake, bam, packages flew
Sipping passion fruit, Alize, in back of the Ooh


We soldiers, boy, we soldiers
Bake cakes, hundred dollar bill holders
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers
Bighead, I thought I told ya
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers
Bake cakes, hundred dollar bill holders
Bighead, I thought I told ya
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers






Ayo seven and a half ounces of brain cells, brain well
Frames, fiery flame, the smoke great well
Bounce, the blacky black khaki shit
By Supernat, you know the deal cousin, come through your town
Snatch me, Muggs shit, thug shit, grenades that strap to they chest
Dukes Of Hazzards be jumping over the rest
Yep the beats bang, we slangin trees lit, leaves lit
Other than that we don't need shit, you eat shit bitch


The spit boxer, the hip-hopper
This shit's cinematic to me like a black opera
I never smoke back woods if they not groomed proper
Me and Rae dropping bombs from the helicopter
The rap scientist, with skills that are truly legendary
Chef cooking up some shit, teaching me the culinary
Crazy, colorful, supernice with vocabulary
I'm getting this paper now by any means neccessary


I got bars, you got bars
Put us together right now you'll get sixteen bars
Standing behind me is sixteen guards
Bruised, battered and scarred, but their styles are odd


Ayo lace something, spray something down for my nephew
This what Lex do, a hot pot of grits in his left booth
Fast speed and shit whole clothes, we ain't gotta beat em
His head gon pop, hus eyes filled with semen


The spit fighter, the rap scanner
I smoke the Incredible Hulk, they call it Bruce Banner
The style ultra, but they say the flow gamma
I'm catching a body and then jetting off to Indiana


Ayo Brooklyn, Shaolin
Shorty lookin at me, flashing with her style on
It's nothing my mami she let me whistle thousands
And gave me a vision to write about a ?child on?
Fouls is long, album strong
A hundred thousand dons come through when ?isles? get on
Trials is on, them cowards is on
Who got the power cat?
Me and Supernat, what's the problem pa? You're wack


If I got problems then I'm calling the squad
I got more on the phone then I started calling the God
Said "Don't worry Supernat, we gon do our thang"
I'm a let this bang like I was Dr. Strange
Half of these cats nowadays is crooks
Playing characters inside life like comic books
See I spits the rhyme son all day
They call him Lex Diamonds, I'm building with the God ?call braid?
When I think, I connect like a Cuban Link
Half of these cats is wack, and they whole style extinct
Yeah, and when I shoot, I go straight for the heart
Touching you in the mental with the verbal darts




Stolen down man, this ill ass fucking beat right here man
Ayo Muggs, good looking out, see what I want, one
Hold your fort nigga, you know how it go
Word up, ayo Shane, whattup nigga
Keep it official, know what I'm saying?
Word up, the Clan nigga, Shallah Raekwon, Louis Rich
Supernat, hold it down, word up, niggas know about the kid
Word up, hold it down, the fort nigga you know what I'm saying (fades out)




Yo, Kane, let's get 'em
I'm talking blackout
Put lives to an end, fuck a tapout
All in together, we gon' wipe 'em
Wax in revenge mode, time for some action


Yeah, relentless, murderous intentions
The henchmen's garments is all black, that's the winners that pimp this
Caught up in my spell, smell exotic, blunt from different trees
Black gloves, bullets will fly when the 9's squeezed
Ghost and I thick as thieves, robbing the whole globe
Black polo, hooded, with Gucci robes with a nice grip
So when the blood hit the floor, I won't slip
Dynamic with my dialogue, you faggots is hog meat
Crack your cranium like crab claws if you cross me
Raging Bull in the booth, Mr. Kane is so raunchy


Death Row shit, fuck the lethal injection
Execute him and chop up his body in sections
Clean-cut butcher knives
X their eyes out
Nail 'em to a billboard
Let 'em dry out


Let me show you what crime about, I'm blowing your minds out
If you ain't ready to throat a nigga, then sign out
Nickel-plated 40's are blowing your spine out
Old-school Caddies with coke, come take a line out
Stingin' niggas for their jewels in their stash house
Snatch a nigga up by his butterfly, sing him a lullaby
Closed-casket, make sure his mother cry
You fuckin' with grimy guys, tunes are suicidal
And now we ain't homies, they call us the homicidal
Get ready for the mayhem, just call it my arrival


Bash him with a disco ball, it's the 70's
Drop a set of the Daily News so they remember these
Black bastards, ruthless killers


Watch me thrill ya
Party killers, we won't die
Hard-body, bitch-made cats is gonna fry
Solidify we're champions, youngins, we're bona fide
Wanna swim with the sharks, be my guest, go take a dive
The name of the game is Bloodsport
You won't make it out alive
I see what you trying for, so give it up
We terrorize shit, Kane and Ghost, lit it up



*sample repeated in background during entire song*

"Guess who's the Black Trump" 

 (Raekwon)

Raise the roof is what we came to do (Like hash browns)
Blazin through, blazin through (Pass that African black gold over here)
Raise the roof is what we came to do
Blazin through, blazin through (You know how we rock)
Raise the roof is what we came to do (Smiff-N-Wess-N-Lex set up shop)


Attack mode, time to strike like a cobra
Poisonous venom into your system killin you slower

My brother's keeper but I put my brother to sleep
If my brother try to creep up
You know my son, show respect when I'm rockin the podium
Steam-rollin on niggas, my team straight blowin em
Got em Throwin they Gunz In The Air like Onyx
Chef and Smiff-N-Wessun crime shit, New York's finest

Blow ya ammo, Shallah seen the god fly commando

Seems luck, chain around my neck, bought it from E-gypt

Come out your shirt, buckle knees-up
This Casablanca rap nigga throw some cheese up
Let's poly, slow-mo status, bring the keys up
Wonderin, runners is lookin mighty fees'd up
Right stupid, FBI sell em ? guns


Make this money, niggas hold up guns
Armed full of licks, plus your dick, drop your ones
Baby need new shoes and a outfit
I see you stick-up kids, you came wit the dick lick
You see my set of twin-hitmen from Bushwick?
Two chicks wit the twenty-two tecs, bitch
You heard about em
Now open up the circle so the dice can breathe
Pay you double, if you triple, if you push you pay me


Gotta poly wit ya crew to stack ya loot up
Get your weight up, big up, pull ya boots up
If you step into the club wit your guns up
If the tension's on your mind then raise the roof up
You gotta keep it in the fam, stack ya loot up
Get your weight up, big up, pull ya boots up
When you step into the club wit ya guns up
If the tension's on your mind, then raise the roof up
Raise the roof up, raise the roof up
Never before we came to raise the roof up
Raise the roof up, raise the roof up
Still in all we came to raise the roof up

 Minolta flash
 Gun in the stash
 Rollin for mo' hash
 Tek, why you slap fire out em, hold fast
 These niggas gotta pay the hard way
 Three the hard way
 Allah swingin on em like a San Diego Padre


You heard what the god say, let's start this
Professional marksman, swimmin like killa sharks
We lethal and heartless
On point like a dart, bitch
Bomb your camp if you want this
Connect wit convicts on some Don shit


And spread the camouflage cats to get the money in Stat
Go to war like Saadam if he pushes you that
Keep his movements discreet when he out in the streets
Had to stash built to high heat for those who creep


Ha, peep the ghetto bastards
Run in your crib like two masked men
I run wit a Tek, and we ain't askin, we blastin
Chef brought the extra cannon from Staten
Rhyme official live broadcastin, makin it happen


You gotta make power moves, black guns and cash rules
Hold my eight straight cuz I been payin dues
Wave king from way back tryin to make a mill stack
Miami money cats that leave you layin down flat

Chorus
*Replace "When you step into the club wit ya guns up"
W/ "When you layin in the cut wit ya guns tucked"*

*Steele chanting "raise the roof up*


It's on again
Word up, put your hands down
Word up, this shit is multi
Y'all gonna see it, word up
Smiff, Wess, Lex
*Steele chanting "the roof, the roof, the roof is on fire*
From the projects, phony projects

(We don't need no water, like the Cocoa B's burn)
(Gotta poly wit your crew to stack ya loot up)
(Get ya weight up, big up, pull ya boots up)
(When you step into the club wit the guns up)
(If the tension's on your mind, then raise the roof up)

Raze da roof up, word up


Guess who's the Black trump








Right, uh, same shit every day, homie
Lord, please forgive me for all my sins
Yeah, nigga wake up to the same shit every day, homie
Walking in the valley of the shadow of death, no rules, right


Washing my sins off in hell's water
Feel like the Bible told me lies as I pray to 'em
Kneel down, put my faith in 'em, will you answer me?


But if God won't help me, this gun will
I swear I'm gon' find my way


Uh, four corners
Cat and mouse chase, got cheese to catch
High on on some drug, I'm Space Cadet
Dreaming I don't live up on the block no more
Trapping, trying to make it out this obstacle
Life on the edge, hell a block away
Pretty Snow White turned eight today
Selling that base, no Dr. Dre
Uh, guess who in the building?
Bucket hat with a strap like a pilgrim
Uh, kneeling down with some questions to address like
Why the ones who commit the worst sins live the best?
The Ten Commandments, I can mark five checks
But I sense flaws, the Bible preaching blind threats
Streets held me down, got faith in a Pyrex
Faith in a four-five, I call it the clarinet
Sewer full of drugs when the toilet digests
From the cop raid, all can relate from the streets
To the wall from niggas to compadres
When the sun go down, I'm predicting a heatwave
Forecast your whole body, heat on, room full of homies
I just pray that the Lord got me




Mic check, mic check, mic check
La-la, la-la, low-low, la-la, la-la, low
La-la, la-la, low-low, la-la, la-la, low




Aim that, shoot that, pledge allegiance
Kill mine, kill yours, make it even
Soul need saving, Mr. Preacher
I know I only come around when it's Easter
Funerals, Thanksgiving, Christmas time
When I'm in jail or when my card declined
Uh, will you answer me?
Take me out of hell and make plans for me?
Misery loves company, ain't a surprise
It was just me and my niggas, we was trying to survive
But we would never make it out alive
Shit, we living to die, oxymoron
Hope to get to heaven 'til that day arrive
Running through the ally, hope the bullet don't collide
Car window shattered, glass on my right side
Dogs bark in the backyard, root for me
Out of shape belly, courtesy of 40
Spoiled only child, baby boy Jody
Same jacket on from back in the day
Praying that the Lord come and take me away




Ayo, tuna fish sandwiches bread, dry and stinking
Black Lincoln, burgundy Mac, I clap a king-pin
Caught me in the airport dusted that I was thinking
On how to stay rich and get bills with my acquaintances
Yeah, money is the issue, I diss you
It's no problem at all, yo, the bunch on the pistol
Cause I'm a suitcase king
Cooling at the gambling spot with a screwed face grin
New Beige Bent, we stay winning, play it again, yo
Put the bone in your jaw, now say it again
Round nightfall under the tents, coming to rinse
Get out the way or let the shotty dispense
Revenge killers who make the events iller
This is more realer, snatch you right up out of the Benz
The Wu wheelers who huddle up, coupes knows the truth
You know the whoopty-whoop, solo or group, I kill niggas

Slammin
Drugs got me wakin' up in cold sweats
Sometimes I'm slightly off my rocker, but I'm on deck
Got 2 and a baby off my bitches student loan check
She hit my line to get that girl, I call it phone sex
Robbing like my problems ain't gon catch up to me later
Bitch I'm mobbing like OG Bobby Johnson, split your potato
At the table, cooking, shaving and touching base with them basers
Bet they try to make a play for the yay' as soon as they taste it
The evasive black American Gangster, sinister, corner hugger
Cuz seeing this nigga shine been annoying me like a muthafucka
This busta owe me, now he act like he don't know me
Forty fo' my closest homie, kill cockaroaches like Tony
Got Montana money
Newport 100 dipped in fluid, yo, I had to smoke it
Pupils dilated like silver dollars, now we loc'ing
Call it devilish how I do bitch
Fuck these niggas talking, I leave they thoughts on my shoestrings
What?



Rolling
Pockets all swollen
Set the record straight, that FNH is what I'm holding
A busta that we know got 15 'bows, bust it open
We came bandana'd up, divide it up, now what's the quotient?
A split with 4 niggas, since I'm a go getter
I think these suckers pussy, I'ma merk the whole litter
Told my girl to leave as soon as I hung up the phone with her
Man, I heard you rob the robbers, look Freddie a cold nigga
Got an ice maker for a heart, made nigga from the start
Life is like a movie, all I did was play my fuckin' part
Cheffing up the crack, the heroin, and weed a la carte
I call it Fast Freddie's, I should own a fuckin' restaurant
Cuz back when I was 12 threw some bells on a scale and I got a pager
We broke them down and started selling nickels to the neighbors
Eventually the penitentiary gon' see me later
Kiss my momma, told her if I die, then it was part of nature
What?


28 days later we all getting fresh
Got the heart to die for something, flesh to flesh
The Lambo, got her outside, it's a stretch
My bitch half Mexican/Afghan, I'm blessed
From living tough times with rough lemons, a gorgeous watch
My team on a dreadful level, yo
Yeah, we still getting money right
Long as the sun come out, I'll hold these twenties tight
Getting fresh, just cooling, my bitch on my dick
Ba boom yo, you live with your moms, just get a grip
Clip in my pocket, my rocket
I think of the Dips, I need Juelz and Jims, with rough licks
Trips to Africa, shorty tear Saks up
I'm out in Bombay, rebels here actin' up
We real, all G, 75-hundred of us
Up in the Sprinter bus, fussin' "we need more heat"




Wu Tang will survive, no no no-no no no
Wu Tang will survive
Cause every time they flip a party
You know the party screams and shouts
Cause you... DAMN! Aw, TC that was the bomb...


Get all my peoples, get all my peoples headphones
All of em
Lay em a death warrant
Aaaah, yo, show it off, kid, show em, what, what
Let em have it, bust it, hey yo, hey yo


Blend wine, who want to win mine
Shorty get a ten-round for floatin
With the richest, huh
Flexed out, Flinstone style
Your crimi-nal pen pal kidnapped Loud, jetted the
Mosyin, posin for them niggas up in Poland
Rollin wax style museum, G 'em
Them richest niggas bless this
Like Russian cut VVS's
Slide the hatchback, black were finessing this
Them niggas over there know, Gazelle goggles
And them Lottos, 88 style, throwin' bottles (bottles)
Scenario rap, rap imperial, material (uh, yo yo, yo, yo)
Murderin' cats is like that real


Yo come do me somethin word to Michelob peep the Land Rov'
Sleeper hold club faggots lay your dome on a stove
It's like space kid, the whole world is pitch black, granola rap
Dough got smaller famous team, walked up in Fotomat
Black down, numerous rounds, boots is brown
Getaway driver, this white bitch from out of town
We love horse races shakin Jakes and high-speed chases
Porno stations, drinkin violations, godly nations
90 minute Maxell tapes, instrumental breaks
Bangin earaches, lay my verse down in two takes
The speaker pops, the Winchester rifle's in the kitchen
Murder the DJ's eyes twitchin, woofer hissin


Yo, he's strong armin, manipulatin niggas, scrapin niggas
Takin play from niggas, hate fakin niggas, yo you hear me?
The whole shit's like wrestling
What you dare me? Back the fuck up kid, we flexin


This rap shit bust yo' gums, and leave you stunned
Pull your plug, now you can't function
There's no to-tal or sum to this equa-tion, you fro-zen
Many may come but few are cho-sen
Pretty niggas want to play the war po-sin
When the ruckus come, they be the first to get their shine stolen
Do or die, it be I, Meta-physical Man
Holding court from my Wu, indivisible clan
I see your thoughts and your hand reachin
It's getting deep in this mud
Cats heat seekin, for one blood
Nameless thugs been aiming slugs, shootin at these stank bitches
Less he gon' bring this above, I make switches
From the lamp I grant three wishes
Johnny be parlayin, I Blaze britches, then I roll
One hundred percent mind, one hundred percent body
One hundred percent soul, individual
Assholes tend to run
From this PLO extortion to the one
The next chamber, you fuckin with the star spangler
To the dawn's early light with this head-banger
Boogie, represent this shit fully
Like I'm constantly at war with the town bully
Who want that pressure, about to get smacked silly
Like a fat bitch in Spandex, free Willy!
We on some milli, check the joint, engine number nine
Niggas wastin time worryin about me and mine
Get your own shit




Wire cell frames on me, good Nike, yeah
True, alotta chains on, this is how we do the thing, enlight me
Clubbed out, bugged out, this is what them thugs bout
Bust off shotties, knock niggas mother's out
Rolling in them renters in winter, too much bones get bent up
The saw'll eat up, your chrome for dinner
We tasting VS's, very special Cognac since G.S.'s
Now we leaning Louis sneakers and C.L.S.'s
I'm far from your average rapper, yeah Shallah, hit with an actor
Cutting through your time, then slap ya
Yo, you see me on them Smack shits, all of my Skittles on
In black whips, living comfortable in some glass cribs
Word to Jabari, my junior, only two years old
Swimming with the sharks, I'mma feed you tuna
Your pops been a whale since jail
Was taking niggas out to Brazil


Where carnivale mamis is ill
Take me to Paul Wall, buy me a grill
I got groupies, buying me Gucci's and exclusive Nike's, it's real
I stay biz in the kitchen with the Chef Rae-Kwiz
It's easy five mill or I'mma have to take they kids
I figured out how to rape the system, I made more than your album budget
Off of a freestyle, on this mixtape, a hustler
That understand dollars and cents
I get blowjobs from runway models in France
The rap Burt Reynolds, when I married the world troubles
Producing earthquakes, turning ya stone hedge to pebbles
The life we chose, the path we lead, ain't none of us'll
See heaven, that's our own guarantee
Never, rat on your friends, always keep your mouth shut
The back of the Benz, put this in your mouth, slut
I saw, I conquered, I came and I'm out
Laid it out, all on the tonsils, then skeet in her mouth




"Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu-Tang sword style. If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous. Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?"
"En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style."

My Glock burst, leave in a hearse, I did worse

But yo, my Clan rollin' like forty macks
Now you act convinced, I guess it makes sense

A mudhole in that ass 'cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creepin' up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin' through your back *swish*

Something new from my real live raps and so catch this
While I kick a verse like chapters
I'm all of that, proceed with the militant act
With the rugged Timberlands or with boots that's black
But on the real, I'm cold like blue steel
Out to catch a hit and make a mill, chill
Maintain yourself Black, you're strapping all of that
But you ain't got shit in this shack Jack
That's my word, I'm used to beef and I can eat it mad raw
And pick it out my gold teeth
But yo back to the subject, Wu's trying to get wrecked yo
Pass the weed thru your shit god mic check, need a little meth yo
True, back to me flipping you and your so called zoo
You got nothing on a nigga from Staten
A drunk monk, smoking mad skunk and stacking
I didn't need rap shit to get me on, I was a crimey
Driving a Benz hearing my man's song
And when shit gone broke out, everybody got smoked out
And cops drove the wrong route
Don't act evil and possess to hurt me, forty guns be flowing in your face
Who wants some

My Wu-Tang slang is mad fucking dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Chopping through your back

Heh, do you know any other styles?

Are you ready?

Uh, down on 40 Deuce, when I was a shorty duke
That's when I first got the Nauti' goose
Now I come through in a sported coupe
I know what you better do, stop talking bout what you outta do
My crack spot is still portable
Funerals are still affordable, I'm better than all of you
I'm in the hood scraping 'em, Jadakiss, Rae and 'em
Ya'll lame niggas, come uptown, spend a day with 'em
Bigger ones, bootleg liquor runs, blow something, nigga
Let the Earth smoke hit your lung, get your guns
The economy is down, so you already know
It's gon' be a lot of homi's in the town
That's why I'm still bringing the seed back
The sneakers that I can't pronounce, that cost a G stack
Niggas in the yard, got this on repeat, black
Fuck saving hip hop, we bringing the streets back, what?


Player spit snipping, different color wallies on
Bliffen had to take 'em off, they fucked up the soles, flipped it
I'm forever zooted, crushed up glass, I'm just flashing through it
Nine times out of ten, suede down at the Jumer
Maybach bloomers, playing rumors, card shark
Getting cash money, take a loan, hit this tuner
We onion head niggas, the gun gooners
Put us together, he run sea, I run land, with one ruger
Stop playing, you know we run rap, you know we done that
Stop fronting, son, put the gun back
We came with the containers, besides having the flamers
My Mexican mans is famous
Running through the streets, the bulldog
Conehead hoodies on, eighteen five for footballs
Maxed like I'm under a good wall, good G
Good recipe, good status, a hood broad


I used to move brown rectangles
Roll you a blunt, then smoke you with death's angel
Chrome trey pound is making your neck dangle
Blue trey eight is leaving your chest mangled
It's math but the gun could kill you at all angles
Leave the toast home, I'm leaving you all strangled
Louis loafers on the Jaguar, gas pedals
You got the cops with you, you ain't even half ghetto
(Not even half) We neither here nor there
But if, you was over here, you would of been got aired
(Been got aired) Like a pair of white Nike's on a summer day
Pointing the gun away, I could kill you niggas a hundred ways
Minds in a place that yours ain't, so I'm wearing war paint
For the day that I see the Lord saint
Blowing the purple haze, playing The Purple Tape
Fuck with Chef or the Ghost, get left with a purple face


Too bad, your courage will be the death of you
*sounds of fighting*




I flip the bronze e, watching King Kong in the palm
Smoke alotta cheeba, chilling, cuz it's all about marketing
Hold the mic, I'm hogging it, handle the goose shit
Word up, mixing the true shit, my niggas'll shoot shit
Trees lean, we get it tight, we get fucked right
We up in the telly, lighting up with the crack light
My mind calculation, attract like I'm counting peso's

The bling swing, a many mansion, a break phantom
Floating through the town on some old new improved shit
Swerve coming through shit, vandals in coupe shit, yo

Smokin bud' I'm outta control wish death on the feds
Cup spills with Grey Goose watchin snuff films
Laughin with dykes that wear patent leather with spikes
My cheddar is right, Miami beach playin it low
St. Barts rent a house and a boat
Two hundred thou' on my throat
That's only half of what my wife ice cost
Phonecall, hearin another boss got his life lost
Well, wipin' sand off of my toes
Read a book called "Catcher in the rye", I chose
Some Bob Marley then I plotted a scheme
To make me and Bump Knux more rich
Then I got me a team, he got 'em a team
He tryin to buy G-force with missile launchers
Tired of walkin' around with beef, with that pistols on us
C-4's better I'm callin up some B-More killers
To come and bleed you
As sure as the sun's in the sky you'll surely die
You washed up, fuck your people

Sons jump in front of them bullets, push me up in the bullet
Stay cool, I got shit, where ya weapon?
Hurricane slammers, earthquake clips and cannons
Back of the building, with the jammers
Live well, eat well, Welcome to the Terrordome, sleep well
Who don't like beefing? Keep shells
I flow with the souls of sharks and criminals in they heart
Play parts of this in detail
Well carried mannered, blampers, ninjas black down
Pop up on spots and vanished ("They say he's a swordsman")




Get down, Lord!
(They say he's a swordsman!)




My nigga give me a few dimes
Going up the block to bag the eights up


Congratulations young nigga now your gun game's grown
With no respect for your elders I'mma mail y'all clones
Y'all been fighting but no change came
Mami just maintain, sick lessons from Rae, we dated in Spain
Eating good foods, he's a good dude
Word to your pops, they had a beef, Rae shot him in his twat
Wisen up shorty pull up your Evisu's Weisel

White man with regals, pull up to the crib with a fucked up joint
Fly laugh get to the point, peoples
Y'all get to here what I say
I'm the invincible to y'all non-lynchable is Rae
Just give me my paper I'mma meet Shaq in Jamaica
And close down the Bally store, them bricks made me wake up
The police they swore when they catch me they would snatch me
And bury me alive with some old dough exactly
Stocks and kangos quit fucking around, don't slip
Sparking every leaf, I slang those mangos
Bag of zigs mind your business, while establish my businesses
All I get is money flying them sixes, uhh
My blood pressure off the meat rack, come to the lab check the heat rack
A few silencers, fours, my doors they swing like whores in London
Stertchpants and stripes, strangling jaws
Dick sucks on weekends, smoke cheeba in the beacon
You know my nigga Keyon and leak friend?
Slick talk this weed *inaudible*
The hardest wool legged and sheep skins

Sirens, cant help you now


Murder by numbers in Monaco
Me all fresh to death, big white thing go kinda slow
Got my elites in the suites, my stones is roughed up
Camouflage pants, my gold cheek

Whatever is said, its still combat boots on the door
Still get a million a week, got the lions in the yard
Barbeque and breadsticks and chic
Fly generals, international, rational raps
Who kill like ten percent of these rats
My team thumpin in the crunches
We fucks with the hard, not anything else just hard




Tiger claw scar on his neck, rockin links
Mad Bull PTS riles and minks
Soldiers and gorillas fall fast in the paint
Protect the projects, intersections, and inks
You still prove gooses are we mooses?
Ears and eyes, mad jury on that blare like acoustics
Kill, kill, kill, kill, yeah more, while she's dying to feel
Soldier ceremony, we gon' go with horses
Nobody dying tonight, cause I said so
More gold chariots, fly back, we fly home
Sit back blinded in the cabin, General Bang
Hundred medals on his chest, neck and stab him




(Revolutionary) What is it like to be helpless?
When you're laying there hungry, yeah
Feel the pain and you're half dead
Not a game, no contest
And no matter how strong you are
Thought that you could be
You listen to me (hey)






You know how we do!


Yo, what's the deal Goldilocks?
Ain't nothing I'm just hibernating, love that watch
Pour me some Scotch and cold Courvoisier
No doubt, have a chair Boo lets get to pollying
Who you with? Me and Molly and some trick who's Yugoslavian
What fabric is that? It's only wool and Rayon
Lipstick crayon, fly Fahrenheit spray on
I'm getting tipsy, I hope she read cocks like a gypsy
And transporting bricks stealing many fifties
Fuck negotiating, is you with me is you waiting
Sweet as carrot cake, faking plus you don't eat turkey bacon
I don't get down like that, I don't get down neither
Cuban links skeezer, why you acting like a rap teaser
I'm like the jewelry exchange plus a range
Nigga you small change I only fuck for figaro chains
Analyzing Miss Clairol, Fendi down, mascara on
Assistant manager in Paragon


Socializing, vibing with my eyes on Dot
She this book cover lady that be blowing up the spot
While my heart was racing, like the hands on the clock
I step live I think she see me putting out the pot
Peace Dot, I'm so happy to see you at the rendezvous
How's life today your hands are softer than Camay too
Your hairdo way more class than Halle Berry
Caught visions of me and you riding on the ferry
Plus your daughter Kiki talk to my man Merry
I order me a Sex on the Beach with the cherry
I order her a Vermidi on ice, sounds nice
She elegant, pretty eyes, glasses, intelligent
Whispered in my ear that she's celibate
Whispered back to her ear we don't have to go there
As I grab the hand set her politely in the chair
As we stopped to stare at one another
Black sister to brother
I'm thinking all the time how she could be my lover


What's happening brown sugar? Say you look so good today
Ankle bracelet wrapped around your leg

Bartender, Chevalier Chateau at table three
Luxurious rings, eyes sparkling

Sometime a black woman just need to be loved
Quiet and shy, baby girl my gift got you high
Made you wanna hit me with the keys to that five?
Just joking baby, I have a sharp sense of humour
Wish I would've bumped into your frame a lot sooner
What's your physical degree, thirty one, thirty three
Half Hawaiian with a slight touch of Chinese
Seen you working at a law firm, on Fifth Avenue
Three blocks from the Gucci spot is where I trapped you
Yo, I'm all into older woman, who's happy living
Love kids and, keep all our business in the crib and
And not afraid to die with me the God on your side

Should have left my Wis' a thousand times maybe tonight though
Yo you sexy motherfucker, damn what's the recipe?

Baked macaroni, turkey wings, a nigga starving

Dance my ass off, paper chasin' Captain, America
Fly high , live as a drive-by
Team of live wires who catch you outside we fire liars

Move! Let's go. police, come on son! They right down the block, nigga
Ya'll got that? You check the train station, one son (Good!)


All of our fathers is bank robbers, holding techs
Eighths of heroin, shooting in the steps
In the 60's, niggas was poor, check the revelation
Now we rock six fifties in the snow
AK's, AR's, wire jaws, say ours
YSL frames in the rain, Marvin Gaye on
Goose bubbles on, stuck in the huddle, trynna transform
Every gram action to a sandstorm
Fly through my block you live, make a bitch stop
Have your shit cocked, yo, niggas might dive on you
All we wear is Filas, Guess, suede fronts, beehives
Bally sneakers, big jewels, Levi's


Back to slinging every 45 minutes
G's fleeing, fiends is in the building OD'ing
The drugs is in the ground, burners on the side of our legs
It's gonna happen so you know we low keying
Yeah, can't sell in here, yup, I said it
Yeah, can't tell in here, they won't credit niggas
Just a lifestyle, the holders with the drugs is dreaded
Just a typical day to get wiped out


Broad day jungle, living with the rodents
The goons'll run through, blow a bag and hunt you
Always flaky, calluses hands my mans
Come through the avenue, Swiss cheese patrons
Blood that flood the hall, every head'll drop
Jump in the Maybach, switch the station
These rap niggas is wash, hang 'em on the pole, no head
Pajama top, handcuff with a gosha
We realer than the Spanglers Rep Posse squad that's dangerous
Take it back to the Lee's and Wranglers
Take what we want, explain this
Famous for my kitchen knives, rings and the fifths are stainless
Gun down your trooper, grenade your coupe up
Plain and simple niggas is poo-putt
Fuck with my crew, what? Either you shot or you cut
Real nigga to real nigga, man, you know how we get down, man






Hey, you know, everybody's talking about the "good old days," right? Everybody! The good old days
Well, let's talk about the good old days!


Know what I'm sayin'?
Take you on this lyrical high real quick
1993 exoticness, know what I'm sayin'?
Let's get technical; where's your bone at?
Get up on that shit, a'ight? Yo!


Started off on the island, aka Shaolin
Niggas wilin', gun shots thrown, the phone diallin'
Back in the days, I'm 8 now
Makin' a tape now, Rae gotta get a plate now
Ignorant and mad young, wanted to be the one
'Til I got (Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!) felt one
Yeah, my pops was a fiend since 16
Shootin' that "that's that shit!" in his blood stream
That's the life of a grimy, real-life crimey
And niggas know that habit's behind me
Day one, yo, growin' all up in the ghetto
Now I'm a weed fiend jettin' to Palmetto
In Medina, yo, no doubt, the god got crazy clout
Pushin' the big joint from down South
So if you're filthy stacked up, better watch your back and duck
'Cause these fiends, they got it cracked up
Now my man from up North, now he got the loft
It's solid as a rock and crazy salt
No jokes, I'm not playin', get his folks
Desert Eagle his dick and put him in a yoke
And to know for sure, I got reck and rip shop
I pointed a gat at his mother's knot
(Yo, Rae, don't do that shit, man! Don't do that shit!)
Fuck that!


Dedicated to the winners and the losers
(Dedicated to all Jeeps and Land Cruisers)
*Can it be that it was all so simple then?*
Dedicated to the 5's, 850i's
(Dedicated to niggas who do drive-by's)
*Can it be that it was all so simple then?*
Dedicated to the Lexus and the Ac's
(Dedicated to MPV's: phat!)


Kickin' the fly clichs, doin' duets with Rae and A
Happens to make my day
Though I'm tired of bustin' off shots, havin' to rock knots
Runnin' up in spots and makin' shit hot
I'd rather flip shows instead of those
Hangin' on my livin' room wall, my first joint and it went gold!
I want to lamp, I want to be in the shade
Plus the spotlight, gettin' my dick rode all night
I want to have me a phat yacht
And enough land to go and plant my own sess crops
But for now it's just a big dream
'Cause I find myself in a place where I'm last seen
My thoughts must be relaxed, be able to maintain
'Cause times is changed and life is strange
The glorious days is gone and everybody's doin' bad
Yo, mad lives is up for grabs
Brothers passin' away, I gotta make wakes
Receivin' all types of calls from Upstate
Yo, I can't cope with the pressure, settlin' for lesser
The God left lessons on my dresser
So I can bloom and blossom, find a new way
To continue to make more hits with Rae and A
Sunshine plays a major part in the daytime
Peace to mankind, Ghostface carry a black 9, nigga
Word up, it's all like that yeah)




It's like this, I'ma start from the top
Inspectah Deck, he's like
He's like that dude that'll sit back and watch you

'Cause he the Inspectah, that's why he the and
And also he the Rebel I.N.S.
You know what I'm sayin'?
And Shallah Raekwon, he the Chef

Basically Method Man is like
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it
And then Baby U, he a psychopathic

Ghostface Killah, you know what I'm sayin'?
He on some "now you see me, now you don't"
Know what I'm sayin'? And and, the RZA
He the sharpest motherfucka in the whole Clan
He always on point, razor sharp
With the beats, with the rhymes, whatever, any DJ


And the GZA, the G is just the Genius
He, he's the backbone of the whole shit


It's self-explanatory, Genius, word


He the head, let's put it that way
We form like Voltron, and GZA happen to be the head
You know what I'm sayin'?


Yeah, yeah, that's cool
So what's like, I mean what's like
Your ultimate goal against in this in this industry?


Domination, baby, fuck that


Can I say this one? Can I say this one?
Right now, right now, we still, we still
Feel like we ain't get what we want yet
When we get, when we get, when we get a little props
And really really get the way we gotta go
That's when you know it's on
You know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause right about now, I ain't braggin' or nothin'
But yo, the Wu, the Wu got somethin'
That I know that everybody wanna hear
'Cause I know I've been waitin' to hear
You know what I'm sayin'?
But straight up and down, 'til we get the goal
We gon' keep goin'


Yeah, 'cause we tryin' to do all this
We tryin' to make a business outta this, man
We ain't tryin' to-- know what I'm sayin'?
Affiliate ourselves with them fake-ass A&Rs and all that
We tryin' to make our own shit
So that when our children, word
So that when our children, all our seeds and whatever
They got somethin' for theyselves right there


We ain't tryin' to hop in and hop out right quick
Know what I'm sayin'?
We out for the Gusto, and we gon' keep it raw
You know what I'm sayin'? (Word)

Niggas try to assassinate me man



Yo, check what happened out of state
I'm knocking off a half-a-cake cash rule, flying at a fast rate
I smoke the black dust, kept my hands clutched, I'm falling in lust
Spoilt plush I played my hand like a royal flush
Baggy jeans, Wallabee Clarks, pretty women
I put it in 'em, shot up in 'em, deadly venom
I hung around the big time bosses
Illegal force exchange thoughts, showing love to all my sources
Spades tried to bag me, like Cagney and Lacey
Chef had that bitch Stacey slippin in Macy's
I doze off, catch a flashback on how I got trapped
And got licked like Papsy in a mob flick I got hit
Stumbling, holding my neck to the God's rest
Opened flesh burgundy blood colored my Guess
Emergency trauma, black teen headed for surgery
Can it be an out of state nigga tried to murder me?
I should've stayed in Job Corp, and now I'm a outlaw
Rae continue to carry a .44 nigga


Dedicated to the Gods and Earths
Dedicated to babies who came feet first
Dedicated to Up North and down state
Dedicated to rich niggas who sell weights
Dedicated to projects with black kids
Dedicated to man who build pyramids

I think it's time to bless them, word up
Bulletproof
First chamber
Yo Chef yo


It started off on the Island aka Shaolin niggas wilding
Old folks scream stop the violence!
True. laying up yo, watching these crack niggas
Playing nuff crap games for what, see
Back in days, crime pays in mad ways
Sporting Tommy Hil with caves, 360 waves
And no searching for loose ends, now I flex 300 Benz
Mad Timbs with mad diamonds
Now that's the life of the good life, sometimes niggas act trife
I paid the price throughout my hood life
Remember I got blasted, now that's in the past kid
God forbid I lay in the casket
But now I'm all about G-notes, no time for weed, mixed with coke
I wash my mouth out with soap
And got my act together, Lo sweaters and better
And phat leathers, so whatever, bring it on




Yeah... yeah... yeah (Let it go... let it go)
Yo, that's right (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (That's right)
Oh, yeah (Check it out, tell 'em, dunn)
Oh...


Y'all niggas can't fuck wit the niggas I fuck wit (uh-uh)
Really don't wanna fuck wit niggas I fuck wit (uh-uh)
Y'all niggas minor league in my eyes for real
Y'all niggas wanna pop shit? See me when ya get a record deal


Yo, if I sat at wrote a verse for all the niggas I hated
Most definately, if not you, kill somebody belated
Sound foul with a subject, dunn, no women or kids
Dump you up under a bridge in a cardboard box
I'm like nothin to do wit it, believe it or not
I'm washin my hands to get bent with Henney or rock
Up in the rep bangin my chest off, pealin my socks
Niggas do it to death, I sleep with my 6 cocked
Like Henney rock, one sip, ya love it a lot
While you sleepin, I'm creapin wit the intricate plot
Cuz picture me up in the morgue, way before my time
Picture you tryin to get my while I'm still tryin to get mines
Asshole, have ya brain lookin like Castro
Dunn, I heard you wanted me (be careful what you ask for)
Bitch, if I buck you, damn Short snitched
The nigga just mad cuz he can't cop crisp




I observe the dread, winter time, big shot in my leg
Blood barrels, a big thick Benneton keg
Razor glass full, salute all teflon, shoot wit the left arm
We sleepin wit nukes, the blood is shed warm
High-voltage guns, nuns wit jums in the gums
Razors, lazers, bulletproof blazers
Yo, remind what the team chanted
They bought the jewel from a don wit a king-sized hat on, slanted
Kangol wit Bentol, ya mental, mid-war
Spill Hen' in the store, that's for the own'
Blaze wit a bent 4, yo these laws is your's
When we pour gasoline all in ya pours and draws
So decievin, flow speed change, lay him down, empty breathin
Instead of these leaks, we leave the weak weapin
Operation: apparatus, spray shots through ya grey Stratus
Straight up status for maggots




Soldier boys stay on ya toes, be on ya P's and Q's
Keep ya eyes bright comin out ya buildin, duke
You might bump into a bullet or stumble on ya death
Niggas slumber, I put 'em in a deep coma
I keep guns cuz it's like that, you figure it out
I got an arson for niggas tryin to figure me out
You ain't a killa, you just talk more, runnin ya mouth
The type of nigga, we'll stomp out and bloody down
Look, we a Mobb for real, don't let the LP's twist it
Cut me a cheque cuz I don't talk business
Drop anthems worth millions and spend millions
Take trips with my niggas to the Keys on the weekends
Serious jewels, pissy off the fruits
Dunn, we move like the marines, move when we come through
Seduce bitches dizzy, half they friends and they moms wanna hit me
Y'all know my stiggity




Yeah, yeah...




RoadsArt waddup
Let me tell y'all a story, man
Listen man, from here


I'm tired of fishscale wars stayin' in all green
New Balance sneaker, white wranglers on the scene
We was youngsters, 80's babies getting in shit
Stolen cars, fell from monkey bars, flippin' and shit
Little thieves fresh out the P's
Broke heads is sled,slidin' through, two' five in my sleeves
Eggs and cheese, young niggas, by any means
We was saved watching Malcolm and Martin
Hold them things police, freeze, niggas is jettin'
No time for off track bettin', we was wetting niggas
Take these gunshots, sippin' rum shots on the roof
Hibernating blow with ease
Better needs, the father seeds, cutting school, dippin' but truancy Ds
Influenced me with trees
Blue and cream, sat back, all I know is how to dream
Check the theme, watch the playboys run with kings


Now it's all about good livin', raising my children
I done seen the flames, escaped from the hell storms
Credentials of a high chief, blowin' on that potent broc' leaf
My old earth got a chance to see a black man run the white house
She shows her bright teeth, oh what a beautiful sight
But still some livin' strenuous through the struggles are unbearable
To ease the pain and eagerly seek the preacher for parables
To stop the rain and hoping somewhere to bring some sunshine
I'm livin' proof that it's possible, any obstacle, you face it
Can be erased son, don't let it conquer you
Throughout my journey had some snakes in my past
But I couldn't let 'em strike me and catch the Devilish germ from them
But the lesson was valuable, yeah, I learned from them
If they ain't godly, they wicked, there's no concern for them
Know in a good space, more connections with more cake
Before I let somethin' come between a nigga I burn some'


Aiyo, burn some', kid
See if a man can flip himself inside out par
He fall out and die if you see all this shit that's going on man
It's real




My uzi weigh a ton, son, carry it
My uzi weigh a ton, son, carry it
My uzi weigh a ton, son, carry it
Ton, son, carry it, ton, son, carry it


Check his vital signs, strike his vital nerve
Threw a viral curve, the rhyme tempest
Like lightning bolts being thrown down from Mt. Olympus
Beat on your head like a Travis Barker cymbal, crash
I splash beyond measurements
I tour you back to a cast, arrest your development
Overthrow your whole settlement, this is beat embellishment
Burn the house, the one Hansel and Gretel went
Unorthodox fly rhyming fox
Wu Killa Bee appear on your body like the pox
Keep rivalries like Yankees and the Red Sox
I'd rather see it in the ballpark, then see it on the block, nigga
My uzi weigh a ton, son, carry it
Chocolate bunny on the run, catching Marriott
Sword in my hand, watch me parry it
The weight of the truth, can any man carry it?




Feel the wrath of a soldier when his wings is up
We like the air force, generals with guns when rainy up
Take it from leers, the stadium, the fans, the beers
Titty shots from the bitches in the stands, we clear
But we pop guns, live so wild, it's like banging a guitar
On your face, all jacked in your mouth
See the medals that I wear is honor, from the hood to Bahamas
Back to Ghana, New York and Compton
All my peoples get wilder than a mosh pit
Roll even bigger, this is getting me riled
Tattoos, I'm a destiny child, I'mma floss
I'm a real muthafucka, stop stressing me out
Cuz I play hard, go hard, smoke bongs, this is the most strong
Collaboration, me, Trav and Ra
Old legends, we gon' respect 'em, drop joints and perfect 'em
Chef is the Jon Bon in Led Zeppelin




This is deadly dark dangerous, Wu-Tang slanderous
Mosh pit bashing, watch 'em all bang to this
Energy, energy, energy, energy
Buzz Lightyear, boy, from here to infinity
Two guns on my side like Yosemite
You sick of that weak bullshit, here's the remedy
Jack Daniel Tennessee, mixed with the Hennessy
Turn into a Chuck D, boy, Public Enemy
Or Flavor Flav, Johnny Depp, Wild Tennessee
Poetical Emily Dickinson with the similes
Metaphor whore, I puzzle like the jigsaw
You stiff like the rigor mor, I be the sycamore
My uzi weigh a ton, son, carry it
Chocolate bunny on the run, catching Marriott
Sword in my hand, watch me bust and parry it
The weight of the truth, can any man carry it?






Yo yo yo! Word to ride nigga, yeah


Aiyyo we four or five niggas with furs on
Up top gated up, big tables got the reserves on
Blowin on saxophones, the band is rough
So much ice on looks like my wrist been cut
And we just made it back from Beijing
Seen my jeweler, told him melt the bird down to eight rings
And the music stopped, Jada stood up (yeah)
Before the speech, he had everybody raise they cups
He said, I been in spots where I can't even mention it
"Don't drink the Cris', Ghost mighta pissed in it!"
Romanian dude, black down, pourin the saki
Face slumped to the side like Rocky
Then Strahan came through, with his bullshit ring
He said YIKES, when I pulled out my monster bling
Don't be afraid of the New York street talk
I switch gear all day bro, like you do on your peach porch
The chairs is suede, the walls is velvet
Marquise ballroom, so live I felt it
Fat asses in fishnets, shakin they pelvis
Playin with they pussy, middle finger drippin, I smelt it
Poker tables, crap joints just for rap niggas

Sam Cooke writin hand, all of my lightning, damn
Used to rob niggas in Sam's, buy shams
For my dude's baby shoe or booster baby, rollin with steel
Eatin Jamaican food under the wheel
You know the deal, book somethin then blow
When from a O to a low, little apartment in Brookdale
Gold was my motto, lotto numbers is what?
Had it in me, rolled down coolin with coke
That's the 90's, Chef era take over America
Bag Ugly Betty up, make her Ms. Guerrera
Pinky wench in sweaters, cortex burnin the mic booth

Cashmere and suede cargoes
On top of the beige Wallo's

That I'm Only Built 4 the Link if it's Cuban
I'm a pioneer, I'm not a vet (uh-uh)
"Last Kiss" is a French one, it's not a peck (uh-uh)
Movin powder, piff and a lot of wet

Sort of like time share where crime, sport it like I shine yeah

Higher learning burning
Ask Vernon got a bed set bought a black jet
Bitch large percentage on her rich motor lodge
Lost her arm, shot with a AK up in the south
Paramedics rocked her
Said she had connections out Anartica
Barrels of juices from Florida
Can't forget live dusthead centerfoldin
Out in Club Med butt ass laying like she dead
Wise guys fell for her ambiance
Pull it together, black renaissance Queen Elizabeth aunt

Yo only on the strength of my man
We ain't hit him with the strong hand
Gun him down leave him out in flatlands
He backhand smacked her
Threw her on the table jacked her
I broke out in laughter fifteen minutes after
Police knocked on the door
Looked out the window of my room

Wise niggas wake up




Shake them niggas


Scary hours no money out, smash the Guinness Stout
Play the outfield, Lucille, switched cracks on shields
She's a rich fiend sacrifice her fam shift them niggas
To Queens
Guess jeans she charged thirty-five beans
Hit the cell phone, regulate with well known Tone
A Wally kingpin who also slam the strike edition
What up? Corleone smoke the bone, Tone phone me
What up? He tried to slang there, address him with chrome only
Grady with the gray beard, transporting for him
Rocking Nike Air, Rastafarian bird, piping that
Switchin Benzes, ten carat nigga with gold lenses
Fronting like he's sitting on a lump, he's sitting on junk
You wanna pull a heist, draw guns and robberies
You wanna rock rep, step in yellow Wallabies
Names arraigned, they're Century Fox, little Glocks
Them niggas with stocks, ______ blocks
Rich lifestyle, spoiled like an ordinary white child
But right now, Sun it still shine, shed light now
Breakdown, liquidate God, fucking grab the nickel plate
'Spenser: For Hire', tension when we mention Dryer
He's a slave cop, behave pop
Isuzu Beige Top will blow that cat at the Purple Haze spot


I remember sticking fiends at the one-six-ooh
When we was starving, ducking five-oh, paying 'em dues
Times is hard in the slums I'm from, they got us barred in
We warring and cage dodging, ripping and robbing
Got the NARC sabotaging, slipping cracks in
Your camoflouging, now you snitching on the squadron
That's something niggas can't pardon
City overrun by young gun with bad intention and Wu-Wear garment
So I see no need to mention, the potency
Of a sting from a killa bee, kicking the battery
Out the back of them wisecracks
Distorted for your get high, you hijack
These friendly skies ain't for you, they for me and mine
This the year of the grimy nigga, ragtime
Keep these niggas on the run, peep my Clan emblem
Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from


Catch us swimming with these sharks now, you rap villains
(I feel the same way you niggas feeling)
We feel the same way you feeling, let it be known (let it be known)
What the blood clot you niggas dealing, you crash dummies
Cash rules, still don't nothing move but the money


Aiyyo strongarm that kid right there with wavy hair
Billy Johnson snatched him out his whip in Times Square
Took his Pumas, nameplate, dude lost weight
Summer '88, started a fight, that can't wait
Ask Dorothy, same kid pussy up in Marcy
Blazing that Ted Rossi up in The Marquees
He lost like a hundred ounces, Jake rushed his houses
Had him on the porch, ass no trousers
This souped up, individual stuck, the new stuff
Same kid crying on the stand with Judge Cuffner
Kissed him with odd numbers three to nine style
Before he left he flashing his face like Denzel
Richard Dale took his Beaver, underwall balling his whip
Mussy dropped and split his wig with the heater
His shape-up was all fucked up, as he had me laughing
God you see how he was laid out in the grass
With dirt in his mouth, Slim woke him up told him he wild out
Blood leaking from his teeth he smiled like he gummed out
Big bolo, stacking his shit, financed a Volvo
He copped his shit from a small coffee shop in SoHo
He still pussy, he sell his dust up on the Lower East
Posing like he rapping out...




Where is he?
Concentrate on the job, don't disturb the doctor


Yeah, word up
Who said we ain't the definition of exclusive shit?
Real rap, you know
Yeah, this is multi expensive rap here, brother
Word up, time to recreate the power
You know what it is, man, nothing but gangsta shit, baby
Let's go Doc, I need that prescription
Aiyo, aiyo


I grew up on the foul side, nickel bag vile side
Purple tops, two for fives
I had seven grams, outside with my eleven mans
On the corners with a pocket full of contrabands
Running up and down fire escapes, NARCs coming
Jump in the window, let your Nikes fly, hide the flakes
Guess up in the Hill it was real to me
What a nigga would of did if you steal from me
All my life around drug niggas, villains who want millions
Niggas with them hoodies on, with techs in the building
Mad fiends, bags of green, Gillette razors
Fly neighbors, all live blazers, designer jeans
That's why we live, niggas need shit in they crib
Go broke, you gonna rope you a vic'
It's just full-time stragglers, niggas try to take your place
And smile in your face, but still and all backstabbers


I was trying to get home
Leave a couple mil' to my kids when I'm gone
Nigga, that ain't cologne, it's the smell of this money
I was trying to get home
Cuz I don't know when my karma gon' catch up
I don't know when the toilet gon' back up
And put me in some shit, that I can't get out of


Come on, bags of money, trying to stay rich and fly
Keep it cool, silks and dungarees
Crew glasses and food, grilled salmon trying to make a move
Those who knowing they be dapping they dudes
How it do, blow a lot of cruise, stay in the cut
Pacing, from here to L.A., and Hawaii and Cuba
Blew new uzi too, serial numbers is brail
So when you rub against it feel all twos
Now I'm with some special niggas
Next level niggas with rubble bezzles
Who drive Exeleros with jewels
Brolic boots on, olive Goose, calamari soups and noodles
That spell out, ya'll niggas the truth
What it is baby boy, reclining in the big Benz
La-Z-Boy, ends uped, lenses on, chips a'hoy
Shipping triple, niggas try to stop the issue
And cock blocked but can't stop the official, what


I was trying to get home
Leave a couple mil' to my kids when I'm gone
Nigga, that ain't cologne, it's the smell of this money
I was trying to get home
Cuz I don't know when my karma gon' catch up

Compliments of my niggas, yeah, yeah, Dre
This is powerful, baby, we gon' take 'em there, man
Locomotive, bulletproof fly shit, let's go




I must tell you that the Clan is a danger to the public
But still for many men just to hear of the name
Fills them with hate and loathing
But why? They've never harmed anyone
I'm afraid they did
*beat drops*
In the past there's something that they would like to forgive
First, I'll tell you about their style, planned techniques
The main style
"Shaolin Finger Jab!"


Yo..
*sounds of fighting*
(Uh-huh)


We are watchin your whole group
You been busy here
Around the clock, all we need is your orders to move
Met a lot of crosses last night
Young and old!
You been busy here
I respect that!


Yeah, (Eh yo), yeah
Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in (Yo)
Come on! You know what it is
(Thou must bust shots all the time, kid)
(Eh yo, eh yo, eh yo) We're back!


Peep The Jump Off, ain't nothin sweet, get dumped off
Frontin like you won't get deaded and bumped off
Drastic son, master guns that'll run up in plastic ones
And then go, crash in the slums
One tight army, few good men that'll rep
Invade you strongly, Prince of Wales swimmin on feet
Props'll sell, all yellow L's, cops sleepin on nails
Niggas get realer than real, yo
Flash the brown, last time was crowned
All navy Woolridge, Wu kicks, movin them pounds, yo
Last on niggas, great adventures of my niggas
And Castro pictures, sendin a rash out the kitchens
Like the wind, invite the grin, watch niggas rewrite the trend
Wu niggas did it again, yo
Unhighly, octane, die cast metal frame
Lame, let another man with heat handle beef


Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in


Yo, spark the intro, relevant info
Load up the keyboard, 105 tempo
Most heated battles, I've blasted MCs
Some said that the bullets flew by like angry bees
Wu entered on the level where we would wait and listen
While one flashed metal, eight calculate position
The world snapped, once we combined our rap
Drastic measures, priceless treasures on Nap'
Our swords swing, windchill Mount Aerie
Native plant standin' on the tall-grass prairie
Snares and kicks, off the project bricks
It's no act the producer played the role with drumsticks
The warning came unnoticed
It's like the shot on the dock of the bay
That slayed Otis, the Nine-Lotus
Each one adjust to his own environment
Formulate this great LP, a hundred rounds spent
Niggas bent on the fruitless search for nourishment
They long for this proper guidance, encouragement




It be the Lost Tribe, 7 days locked in the dungeon
Foamin at the mouth, mad dog in this production
The uncontrolled substance got me spittin up bars disgustin
The last temptation of the son of David Ruffin
Hold my mic sideways when bustin
On Judgement Day runnin through Hell, yellin and cussin
At MC's in my circumfrance, y'all niggas hand-cuffin
These hoes and ain't read them they rights or nothin
Keep lustin, yeah and I'ma a keep hustlin
With Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in
You know me, everytime you kiss that ho you blow me
You blow trial trin to walk a mile in my Sauconys




We just touched down, Wu shuttle, private jet
Stepped off the plane, the world wept
Roll with the Witty Unpredictable
Talent All Natural, rock with the beatles of hip-hop
Mathematical imperial manifestation of greatness
Make wiz's scream and shout at the top of their breath essence
Captured on tape is precious
Bless mic pure deafness, awaken from you sleep mistake
When the God bring rain, hail, snow to the earthquake




You've been busy
Are you mastered?
{*Repeat 3x*}
You've been busy here..




{*people screaming*}
On the floor, now, NOW! Do it, do it
{*gunshot*}
On the floor, now, NOW!


Oh shit~! It's on huh?
(Aiyyo sit your boney ass the fuck down)
(We not fuckin playin in here)
This is a stick up, nobody move, get on the floor
Get on the walls, take your sneakers off, take off your drawers
Cover your dick, bitches be quiet, don't say shit
You move - I'mma make sure I clap you and ya clique
All my gunnies is squeezin
Listen to me, before you die, just leave with my cheese
I ain't playin I'm sprayin, off top, doors is locked
Fuck around, try to run around, you greasy
Don't even dare - put your cell phone down dear
Before I put my gun in your ear
I'm not a new jack, an Iker or a jerk with a pump
I'm straight sober, I'mma feed my ratchet and hunt
We kill Willies, still hillbillies don't call us nuttin else
Might have to melt your Phillies
You old man, sit down - tie up his hands
And yo smack flames out him, get more and then blamp him


Don't move! Don't fuckin move!
Put your hands in the air, put your hands in the air
Get 'em up!! Get on your knees
Get on your knees, GET ON YOUR KNEES
Gimme that fuckin bag man
Gimme that shit you're my fuckin wife man
Get the fuck out


This bitch started blowin me in the safe
Her fantasy to fuck a bank robber so I blew a load in her face
I knew her from Canarsie, used to work at Chase Manhattan
Smiled when I walked in wavin the ratchet
An inside job, the best kind, the rest I rob
Stay on the ground or you'll be laid to rest by God
I seen big face hundreds and bearer's bonds
I also see cameras on, I'm glad I wore my ski mask camouflage
Listen to "Lamb of God" while I packed the bong
While I studied how to disable a bank alarm
We got three minutes, handle the job; I'm standin on top
Of the counter with the chopper barrel starin at y'all
Why you pussies bleedin all on my money you fuckin up my hundreds
Don't get your fuckin head kicked on some dumb shit stupid
We the future of this bank robbin industry
Kidnap the judge and get a hundred years conspiracy


Everybody in the vault, get out, move!
{*screaming*} On the floor, now, NOW, do it, do it
On the floor, now, NOW!
Let's play a game Mr. President
It's called spin the dial



New Chef Capabilities for Automated Infrastructure Testing, Container Integration, and an Analytics Platform Bring Benefits of Web-Scale IT to the Enterprise

SEATTLE  July 15, 2014  Chef, the leader in web-scale IT automation, today announced strong business growth for the second quarter of 2014, demonstrating surging demand for its commercial automation platform. Chef also today released new enterprise product features that expand the Chef platform, powering speed, scale, and consistency for enterprise companies who want to accelerate time to market and delight customers through web-scale IT strategies.

Web innovators like Amazon, Facebook, and Google have changed customer expectations about on-demand digital products and services. To meet these expectations, enterprises must adopt practices of the web innovators and make their infrastructures more agile and resilient. Research firm Gartner estimates that by 2017, Web-scale IT will be an architectural approach found operating in 50 percent of global enterprises, up from less than 10 percent in 2013.

News Highlights:

Chef has examined the practices of hundreds of its customers who have successfully implemented web-scale IT and found that they all use automation to achieve a consistent infrastructure, follow DevOps practices, have comprehensive insight into IT operations, and actively encourage innovation. With new product offerings for each of these patterns, Chef is the only automation platform that gives enterprises the capability to operate at web scale.

Strong Business Growth: Chefs sales continue to accelerate, with the companys incremental recurring revenue growing 182 percent year-over-year (YoY) in Q2 2014. Chefs customer acquisition is also surging, with new Global 2000 customers growing 100 percent YoY in Q2. Chef acquired a record number of new customers in the second quarter.

Test-Driven Infrastructure: Test-driven infrastructure ensures maximum IT safety and consistency with programmatic and automated testing of the entire stack. Chef is the first company to offer its customers commercial support for test-driven infrastructure. Chef has also created a single installation package  Chef DK  for the open source tools covering the entire test and development workflow, from the workstation all the way to production. Rally Software is among a range of enterprise customers using Chef for a test-driven approach to infrastructure and applications (see separate release).

End-to-End Container Workflow Automation: Chef is the first automation platform to deliver end-to-end management of container workflows. Chef Container is a build of the Chef Client that integrates with all Linux containers (LXC), including Docker, to enable seamless management of container resources. In conjunction with Chef Container, Chef is also releasing a Knife Plugin-in for Docker integration with Chef Container, enabling users to launch, configure and manage Docker containers. Together, Chefs new suite of container tools and content fully automate the creation, management, monitoring and testing of containers, making them versionable, testable, and repeatable within a production workflow.

It advocates DevOps, the use of open source software, and adoption of continuous delivery principles  and automation is its foundation.

Rocket launcher out the window, you shoot


Got killers in the Benzes
Canine senses
Everything covered from the exit to the entrance
Dedicated goons understand it's high stakes
Life out a nigga 'til his eyes dilate
It's a cold world
Surely weather with the V bombs and leathers
With the fur on the collar
We 'bout major dollars
See the hoes, they holla
When they eat us and swallow
Cause we them dime dadas
Get them top shoppers
Eyes on us, death to those that lied on us
And love for ever for all my soldiers that cried for us
I put my mind on it, relax, get high on it
Y'all niggas ain't built, I was designed for it
Lame niggas fall back in our presence
Bow down to the king, when you see me, nah mean

Fucking dog crying, ever seen a grown man scream


You tacky like head rest TVs

Smoke stack lightening, coming out the crack black window
That's us getting high, letting things go
We getting it, the money don't stop
Beef don't cease, the drama gonna pop
Soon as we step in the spot, shots on me
Line 'em up, kill every single bottle they got
The drama gonna pop like the pipe bomb
Hyper, the son don't chill, Allah

Will I die before 50, tried to get my palms read
I'm dead through the eyes of a gypsy, bloodshed
Survivors move wise through the city
Word to mother, only a few alive off of pity
High ride, and a five palm clutched on a blinky
Other hand, pull up another dutch that I twizzy
Soaking a C.I., slow look out in the street
Few goons, singing the same tune walkers on the beat
Little niggas that's try'nna put Jordans on they feet
O.G.'s that's try'nna get to Portland, where's it's cheap
I move with that Indian hustle in me
That fat cat, that world, that black jaded Bentley
Got bucks, but I'mma trynna get "moore" like Demi

With them big elephant guns, and fly 'Zito's





2 tablespoons of cinnamon
And 2 or 3 egg whites
A half a stick of butter
Melt it

Stick it all in a bowl, baby

They're packed full of vitamins and good for you
So suck on my balls

A quarter-cup of unsweetened chocolate
And a half a cup of brandy
And throw in a bag or two of sugar
And just a pinch of vanilla
Grease up the cookie sheet
'Cause I hate when my balls stick
Then preheat the oven to three-fifty
And give that spoon a lick

Say everybody have you seen my balls
They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick-me-up
Just stick my balls in your mouth

Suck on my chocolate salty balls
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em
Suck on my chocolate salty balls
They're packed full of goodness, high in fiber
Suck on my balls

Hey, wait a minute
What's that smell?
Smell like somethin' burnin'

What are the true keys to being a ninja?
Dressed in all black, perfect vision, and that movement is in silence, ah
What are the true keys to being a ninja?
Dressed in all black, perfect vision, and that movement is in silence
This is Shaolin (Shaolin) this is Shaolin (Shaolin)
This is Shaolin, Shaolin, Shaolin
This is Shaolin, this is Shaolin
This is Shaolin, Shaolin, Shaolin


He threw a kick at me, I back-slapped him, I pulled out the mac
He kicked it out of my hand, how real that?
Yo, a place where niggas get it on at
I think it evolved around three hundred raps, thirty stacks
He had black on, yup, I was dusted, with all of my bangles on
Two rings clustered, shorty black
He was there, this my nigga, check the bullshit, he jabbed China Man
He threw a sword right through his wool shit
Now he throwing stars at the kid, I'm jumping over my car, yo
Trying to get to my glove box and shit
Got the door open, gash in my caesar, my sneakers got red on it
Know that's blood, he threw a piece of a chain with a long blade on it
And a nigga was buckwild, I'm ducking and dodging
Trying to stick 'em with my little blade, Rae in some trouble
I got to the glove box, I threw two shots, he disappeared




I stay there like it ain't nothing to face fear
Flowers by the grave of the niggas who say where
I'm straight tear, tell them don't play fair
Then retalliation, I'm a shake 'em just for scraping my suede pair
He told me "Yo, wait right here, son, I been there"
Rip your pockets off plus nut in your dame hair
Broad day, even with jake there, serious
Last time you saw me I was rocking the same stare
Do or die, you or I, cousin, I pray for you
Forgive me for my sins, father, this is what they made me do
Nonsense cause me to slay the fool, rather than play the fool
I resort to waving the gauge at you




The year of the bullshit, why me? The nigga had Asics on
A three hundred dollar pair, B
You don't scare me, wiping blood, hear me?
He laugh with a sinister grin, the sun went down, this is grim
Now I'm sweating, still repping my square, you probably under a chair
Black hood on and sporting a gray beard


Respect mine, or there go your head line
A nigga got caught up, and left naked sporting a necktie
Skip town slide to west side, CSI riding on my hides
So I'm out til next time




They can find Saddam Hussein in a fucking hole
But you can't tell me who shot 2Pac?




Woke up this morning, smoked some sticky green to get me started
Choclate thai, all in my eye, I'm never broken-hearted
Bang us in ya cars, bang us in ya Jeep, bang that shit retarded


(Bob Digi) Sun Zeini
(P. Sunn) 12 O'Clock
Two On Da Road on this (12 O'Clock)
I love my brother to death
(That old hip-hop, catch this)
(Hot Nix', you know? Big tits)


I love my brother to death, nigga pussy to the rest
Shared a pair of Guess and an Eddie Bauer vest
A bitch named Celeste
I met her when I was goin to cash a Def Jam check
She had some big ass breasts
I had to catch her like a shortstop on the Mets
A nigga high off a dime from Gates and Best
Remember grandmother live on Louis and Lex
I remember Dirt Dog crashed his white Lex
I remember me and Meth won a dice game against Ghost and Deck
Remember Portland had Clyde Drex'
Remember 12 O'Clock is a vet
Big Dogs we put 'em to sleep, keep 'em on a leash
I move like days in a week
Niggas don't know the face and names on my teeth
Niggas carry a cold piece, and separate the heat
Ain't scared of the motherfuckin police


Yo, yo
Guns jammed up, I'm cramed up in my lab
Six niggas, six bitches, two fifths and eight bags
One toilet, three weedheads, an alcoholic
And two niggas hooked on pussy
And in the corner, was this brother who would study his lessons
And learned how operate the Smith and the Wesson
Still cut class and played hookey
Threw freshmens in garbage cans, gave 'em nookies
Rolled the, back of the bus with a gun in his socks
Big forehead, had ears like Spock
He was mightier than a truckload of gats
And bound to make a bitch cum in six minutes flat


What up kid? Stay livin
Seen you look good, you look live in ya linen
And you survived ninth innin
The hood got us off the prop without women
All my niggas that ride that provide to the end of this


Ain't nothin but the real, yeah
Ain't nothin but the real
Ain't nothin but the real, yeah
Million dollar deals, rollin on Chrome Wheels


Yeah, uh-huh, yeah (Ain't nothin but the real)
This one's on P. Sunn, word up? Yeah, uh-huh


We gamble the dice
Remain humble, scramble through the jungle of life
While the we rumble with the foul and trife
Shots fired on the block in threes like Glen Rice
Made men think twice about the sacrifice
Black on white, write it for the world to hear
Write it for my fam who not here who do care
Glance and stare, why when you can't compare?
From the bottom of my feet to the end of my hair
Move rear, cop the blue steel bare, groove to the snare
Bass and drums, see my face in the slums
Pedia Brown, media surround my sound
When you see me in the hood of ya town, respect my sound
Sample with black, criminal, mechanical rap
Assemblin hat, laced in a suit from Phat
Two On Da Road, got them bitches screamin, "Who Dat?"
Two with the plaques, two with the gats, it's like that




Two On Da Road, Bobby Digital
He's a gangsta, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no
Live it up, live it up
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no




Bang us in ya Jeeps
Shaolin! Bobby Digital
Uh-huh, Sunn who?

Shout in pain
Uh-huh, yeah
Weed blazin, cocoa hazin, cocoa hazin

Word up man some big things been happening but shit
You know what I'm saying?
I just want to inform niggas
Word up man come get this bread too man word up man


We at the  blowing on piff
Got the spliff barking my wrist glaring up
Blazing cold shark skin dicing with Tyson and Sugar Ray
Burning up a lot of ones cooling in the sauna all kind of Asians
Introducing my connects Lexis automor bed
She shot in the room and bought out the checks
You never know if there's cameras in here
I said in low tones flashing the gold phone around with begets
Yeah for you it's a big come up good looking out my nigga
Ninjas like you I ride to the death
I just stared nodding my head said it's peace soldier you just hood clumsy
But always kept it real I'm impressed
I ran a  like I was the best
Feeding my whores I gotta ranch spot that's killing up techs
The pussy $9.95 only cash no exceptions they all ill with ass injections yo


Anybody get it, everybody killer
Heights like, trife life drug dealer
A legend never seen like a chupa cabra
CNN, stick up shit, we on that ra ra


Homie creeping out the lobby, hot as wasabi
I bet the doctor's party couldn't see as high as I be
I'm on the second floor with the .44, watching the entrance
While you pat him down Glock on the benches
We on some cab takin' shit, racist Jamaican shit
Put his shoes and money all in a bag we raid him shit
Yeah I know this Taliban, Afghanistan Pakistan
Tell him, "make a wrong move, then we blast his man"
Then I bust off, yellow tops like duck sauce
 cut from a different cloth
His moms is Miss Jones damn why you shoot her Pop?
Fuck everybody could get it there's no rules in guap
Then 'Pone told me, he was close to him
I felt bad, I just put the toast' to him
That's minor collateral damage granite, I stick up the planet
Take you with the left squeeze it right handed


Anybody get it, everybody killer
Heights like, trife life drug dealer
A legend never seen like a chupa cabra
CNN, stick up shit, we on that ra ra
Anybody get it, everybody killer
Heights like, trife life drug dealer
A legend never seen like a chupa cabra

Still peeping out the project window, 
Shorty with the fanny she bimbo, it's simple
(She fuck whoever slanging that crushed glass)
(Setting niggas up get em stuck while I'm pushing they mustache)
Yeah shorty do her 
Got some niggas trying to come and hang me
That shit only got me angry
That shit ain't never happen captain I'm right here
I'm just involved for the action, now you know my niggas won't fight fair
And 28 days later, Al-Qaeda, Noreaga
Killers from Haiti to 
Bringing more machine guns than guerrillas, Navy Seals 
Obama kept it real he fuck with us
And then 'Pone told me, it was his own shorty
They cut school together back then they drank forties
 strawberry and vodka, Russian knockout
 I had his ho in my chopper fuck


Anybody get it, everybody killer
Heights like, trife life drug dealer
A legend never seen like a chupa cabra
CNN, stick up shit, we on that ra ra
Anybody get it, everybody killer

Seven joints, see the lady with the grey hair? That's her man, he stay here

Walk slowly, follow the buscuit
You try some tough guy shit, you gon' kiss it

Tuck ya head in the phantom, say good night
Come out them Air whites, you know we got mink in here

Dressed in all black, lowerin' my glasses
Half my arm crossed, bulletproof draws from last year


I said I'm probably in the buildin'
In the lobby gettin' ill and
It's a hobby just to kill 'em
Catch another slight feelin'
Stash the bodies in the ceilin'
If you ridin' then I'm willin'
I say we blaze 'em cuz they hatin'
Since they braggin' 'bout they cake and
That's a reason just to take it
Cuz we should leave 'em in they basement
Have 'em bleedin' from they faces
Cuz we gotta see these papers


I heard... (click click, don't move)
Rae already had the drop on 'em but I'm the goon across the room watchin 'em
Rae I told to follow him, a dude that made that move I had to hollow him
That son almost fainted from lack of oxygen
Rae loose and just laughin' 'em
I took him from the bar to the car to the fuckin' garage then put a shot in him
But not before we got all that info, caught him for ten notes
And told him baby Macey was kin folk (yeah you remember her, right?)
Been choked, move coke, he got lift Volks
Went broke cuz dude owe dough and he went ghost
He dipped and he got rich, now he's on that strip
And got bricks, tried to shit on niggas that he got pissed
They found him with his top lift, lookin' like a bogie that got lit
Then got clipped, niggas think they hot shit (Nah)
They not shot, I don't pop shit I pop shit
Bop shit, leave 'em stretched right next to they hot whip (BLOAW!!!)




Yo, I heard... (click click, don't move)
Everybody in the spot thought I was a chick
I played it so cool, sippin' a Martini with a wig on
Holdin' my drink but that wasn't the only thing I had a grip on
Little did they know I was a goonie with a hammer
About to make a movie, no camera
Then I seen that gold phantom parked outside and Rae walked in
With a ratchet on him big enough to take off limbs
And said... (click click, don't move)
The first to flinch'll get it the worst, my killas is old school
The chrome tool had my palm sweatin'
Rae give a signal and P.C.'ll give niggas a hard lesson
The bad boys, you nah wan' test 'em
I leave you all restin' in a peaceful place from my weapon
The fifth'll disect 'em, nigga, Paulie got the papers
Donnie got the bricks in a bag, I'll see you later...

Aiyo Clientele Kidd
Layin in the crib gettin' ill money, those who 8 hours get gig
Got rugby's on and 4/5ths
Attractin' them niggas I go against, the money was his
One nasty unit of murderers, all type of Goons'll watch
Then four minutes later they burgulars
I heard from the grapevine mine made it
Elevate the name up, this gift gotta reign and his game went up
And now he's stronger than ever, Nike jackets and Classics
Go against it and it's instant vendettas
He run things, gun down Kings, check the joint the kid flyin' in
Crib in Africa with two lions
Somethin' like the Prince of a jewel thief, so smack the millions
Came back wrapped it up, too sweet
The game is missin' somethin' unique
I put too much to fall back on, I rather just sleep


CHEF! We designin', rhymin' with Diamonds

Very rarely you find me without the mini-shotti
Just waitin' for Rae to give me the cue and
You see about 100 Puerto Rican niggas shootin'
Get down, lay down, we don't play around
I don't know what you heard but, we don't play around
It's cooked coke, but look, but what the fuck happened?
How you leave the dope game to persue rappin'?
Already knowin' that ya shit was trash
Breathin' hard on the mic when yo' click is ass
All we tryin' to do is bring dignity to rap
And you kiddin' me? I'm literally the epitome of that
Uh, we much better than y'all, Terre-error the Squad

Whether Marcy or Comstock, triggers 'pon cock
Straight punch in ya lung and you niggas gon' drop

Yo yo yo shoot him in his mouth.. (nah)
Fuck him, get the gasoline tell Terry to pull the Ac' up
Bring him to Rae warehouse, hang him from hooks then skin his ass
As lame as he look he ready to cook (yeah)
And he pleadin' for mercy, bleedin' from his dome and he thirsty
The first week we made him eat shit!
Videotaped his wiz and I fucked his bitch
Made him watch me on the couch havin' fun with his kids
So what hurts more: is it me showin' love to ya fam?
Or you in the box laid under the floor?
Or keep you alive blow torchin' ya balls?
My murder chainsaw, ya bloods on my Scarface walls
Not even Ajax can clean that, Jack

Onion stretched, vice grips twisting ya legs

Let me bombard he, little ass chain, only a car thief
Moving like the lords, what up?
Blow a Dutch dude
Parley with the pushers who wear Clarks and Bucks
But still a Gucci slayer, word to my five year old
Salute me baby, daddy got money we blowin' out in Haiti lady
Choppers, Bulgari watches, rums, and copper
Blue wraith with a steel face, yah I'm a popper
Hundred niggas with me, some guns hittin' in Bentleys
Rock Csonka shirts baggin' bitches move about discretely
 ready to fight but it's a Monday
Everybody dressin' it up, let's flip the runway
Tax time, seein' 'em run through, yo that's mine
 daddy whatever baby bag me

Every time you are near
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky?
Every time you walk by
Just like me, they long to be

In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Just like me, they long to be
Close to yo

The D's knew, flew him to the south, had 'em in the barn
Arm all shredded out, vex, forget about it
His lady, Baby Blue Eye, she kept a mack in the refrigerator
Yelling how she hate me with eyes, when they bumped her
Found a Louis bag in the dumpster
New blue uzi that ripped her fronts up
She leaning, I start dreaming, damn
Niggas shot shorty in the mouth, then slid in the Lamborghini
Eight days later, they weight her, found heroin
All in the bitch arm, trick from decarter
Her girl durell nails, nigga, that's who you could say tell
Anything and everything, the nigga's in the jail, yo
For Filas, she need, need, come to, to cry
This a live bitch from the east, fronting since junior high
But let's continue to peep it, Steve, the nigga been through
Mad situations, since he crashed his Benz station
All the FBI and 'em, hide 'em
Waiting for the right time to blow a nine, right through a spine
The grind was getting serious, the coke scarce
Only niggas who live can get it, if they gun game fierce

Coconut oil, smooth slide through the vintage
Spot that we used to rock early in beginnings
My head used to spin then
A small crowd trippin on me, flippin
Now the family expand in London, in Brixton
Smoking winstons how my lips burn to touch mics
95 grey nikes
Feel the re-release of beast, middle east
Ain't not saving um like day light
Arab? Muslims? All of um my cousins
Beauty brown skin might
Bomb on a nigga
Ain't nothing to do wit Qurans
Ramadan for the figures
Cheddar
Come night we all eat together
Kings and Queens accented with gold leather
Royal
Sippin Royal, smoke like two letters
Two Ls, swell
Blow up your spot, never
Underestimate the plot, my flock stick together
Shining on you daily, no matter crazy the weather
Glimmer like diamonds in chains
Pain a pleasure, in time, if it help me do better
Promised my mama, said Imma get you whateva
You just dream, 9th gon keep the swing
Opposite cream, we gon ride all black living better
I brought it back, like I told yall, forever
Culture, keep it focused you cant sever my ties
Im always gon ride Jamla till the death of me



Your face feel like suede, body is a 9.9
One more time, a diamond on display
Tiffany goddess in tennis wear
Staying a dentist, all that white on
Dro mixed with Guinness
We flew to Milan
Cherry Range Ro on the lawn
Boo, where ya Quran?
Its right here
Weird palaces in Mecca
We dressing, less filming she cryin
All praises then extended both arms
Laid on the rug, thought about like life style
Hugged my lady harder, regarded
Regardless pardon Miss lets flow beyond
Palaces where blue water just flow
Coolin wit a bong
The ocean was talking to me
Stay sucker free, be gone, love your enemies
Nights may seem you wrong
Lights, camera, and wealth a song
I sat up for days before legend status
Now we be born


Its that
Its that that black sand talk right here
Word up, yo Raps what good
You know your brother got you
Damn, I hear that fly shit going on in the back
9th Wonder you remarkable nigga
You like a flooded ill magic marker

For them gangsters
Sniff your brains out all my Al Capone, Al Pacino nigga's
Yeah, let's get it, Yo, hey yo Bill represent nigga what up, what up


An eight ball of coke will make Sara smile like Hall & Oates
Line it up, spread it on the table like Torah scrolls, homie
But if you Len Bias, you're a goner
Now put the money in the bag before me and Rae pull an Osama
Square biz, no plots or schemes boy
Hit you with 50 shots like them cops from Queens
You're on a cross with a crown that bleeds
Resurrect you with a speed bump and trumpets that sound like screams
Shoot the bitch in the trunk of the Buick for foolishness
Killed for losing bricks, this is Only Built For Cuban Linx
Lord know I got mouths to feed
So my heart is ice cold to anybody outside my team
Fuck you, pay me a million dollars, matter fact, make it a billion
Fuck a condo I'm taking the building
Posted like the Freeway Ricky Ross in the Porsche
And hosted by Manowar's Ross the Boss at L'amours


Sniff your brains out all my Vinny the Chins and Joe Pescis
With coke recipes and hoes on ecstasy, La Coka Nostra a brand you can trust
Catch me in the bathroom stall handing out bumps


We blast shottys off the roof, strapped, trapped in a coup
Living like this, duke'll have a nigga bidding in boots
I swear to my seeds, daddy gonna buy you the V's
But instead I got trapped and started buying them keys
I went from rich kid, selling under the bench to lynch kid
High power money nigga living in Richmond
Wore a few beefs, ran through hoods, ordered new jeeps
Pull guns on police, shot up the four seasons
Then I got clapped, yapped, thought I had it right
But I was wrong then, now I get it on when I write
I rectify this, you live by the sword and get fried by the board
Cause that's the only way we got to get on
What it is nigga, get high, remember the grizz
And play the tape that resemble the great, that's Raekwiz, nigga
Stay real, history's ill, don't stop til you cash in
Catch me in the Aston with Bill Pill






Fix your face, when we rhyming, we been crazy
Throw mad bullets at you, jumping in new spacely
All my goons is frustrated, groan at they P.O.'s
It's obvious, we do this, we bust haters
Yo, gun selectors, dumb detectors
Chase my niggas, talking slick, where that Lex kid at?
You know we cool and we Darth Vaders
Always in black uniforms, rocking Clarks and sharp gators
Can't tell me nothing, I've been shaking
Pull out them slammers, regulate the streets, I bake Satan
How many of us it take paper and start a war
It's like starting up a store that sell aces
All my colors and bad brothers, rag coverage
Black gloveses, leathers and glass lovers
Introduce these leaders, wanna take money
These dick beaters, and strangle something up, go get Jesus


Look, the coke, the coka, the cocaine
The C-O-K-E, it's coke, man
They lift the weight up in snow plains
You sniff an eighth up in your brain
The coke, the coka, the cocaine
The C-O-K-E, it's coke, man
The prices rise like some propane
The nicest guys become so fame


Illegal transport, son, I throw bombs back and forth
It's a contact sport, get your arm cracked off
Yo, I blast like I'm task force, stashed in my dash board
Exercise black thought, dance on a catwalk
Grew up on the asphalt, trynna get my grams off
Watch for the hand off, I'mma get my plans off
Like you and your mans off, everybody huddle up
Twenty cent dime pieces, watch the water bubble up
A piece of the puzzle, son, pieces, crumble up
My old righteous troublesome, now I'm into major things
Made it this far, kid, the God got on angel wings
Everytime the flavor bring, tons of coke, mad gross
Two cuts of lactose, I'm underground like railroad
Mad low, son, in this hellhole, an animal
Friendship be flammable, no shame for some to blow
Brains out for fun, over cocaine and guns




Ever since a little youth, I've been bent on stoupes, sipping gin and juice
In the booth, fill the dope game, shooting on bent up hoops
Roll around in stolen cars, nah these ain't no rented coupes
Grimeys behind me, they all grimey, ninety percent of controlled
Lying in the booth, put the ashes in the pipe
Blowtorch to the crack, my fire is winter proof
Old thoughts of black and white pictures, now they developing
Skeletons surrounded by archangels and seraphims
Telegram packages distributed through the whole hood
Tell him this racquet is bad for him but it's so good
Are you a fighter? Real life scuffle, no dirt clean
Plus a muthafucka had to hustle since 13
I got my mind in focus, where you never been at
How you think I made a hundred grand, from where my pen's at
Fuck the fortune and the glamour, I don't need no fame
I piss whiskey and spit fire, I bleed cocaine, muthafucka




FREEZE! ROCK!
FREEZE! ROCK!
FREEZE! ROCK!
FREEZE! ROCK!




We do have to fear him, the Shaolin faces a crisis
And one of the factors will be the Wu-Tang Clan
I just wish he was there... (damn)
So we must all be prepared


Them niggas over there, man (whooooa)
Feds been on them niggas all fucking year, son (What I'm gonna do)
(When it's cold outside) Look the nigga's in a bag right now (Haaaaaa haaaaa)
They zipping a nigga off, son (How how... oh oh oh)
Right... (It's cold.... oh oh oh oh oh oh)


When it's cold outside, and the rain turn to ice
When it's cold outside, and the rain turn to ice


Said mama's out here flipping out, shots just going off
Somebody laid out, little kids smoking weed
Drive by's, every day wondered what's going on
Me outside with my motherfucking AK
Ohhh ohhhh... what I'm gonna do when it's cold outside...
Hoowww howwww... ohhh ohhh... it's cold... hey...


Religious with hammers, fakes get jammed up
Cakes get battered, coming through to get it, them transactions
Blood stinking fiends, machine guns, cannons and teams
Baking sodas, gold Rovers and gophers
Land in every project, sex, lies, murderous reps
Back to cassettes, vets dying on steps
What's really taking place in them hoods?
Heads get clapped for trap, don't fuck with my mind, I'm strapped
Off with ya dome for fronting on me
Last two L's, I seen visions of dead male and more sales
Real life stories is made, and candles got blazed
For little young soldiers shot by them strays
Pigeons and goons surviving in prisons
Cause divisions, they separating, laying cacoons
And they can't wait to come home soon
While bodies get found in lobbies, chopped up, decaying in rooms


They found a two year old, strangled to death
With a "Love Daddy" shirt on in a bag on the top of the steps
Police blowing niggas, NARCs and judges
Me and son had beef, I had to merc him, we supposed to be brothers
Cause he came home fronting, feeling like that I owe him something
Cause I'm getting money, drive a little something something
Renee got AIDS, with five kids smoked out
House is brick, bills haven't been paid in days
A Brooklyn man's a molestor, court case and the crime's raising
Swastikas on the church, they Satan
Holiday season is here and I'm vexed
Who the fuck made Christmas up? I'm fucking broke, it ain't making no sense
Newports are $7.50, a box of Huggies is off the meat rack
She's back, thirty days, she relapsed
Our troops need to leave Iraq
And rap niggas need to go on strike so we can get more cash
Cause...







"oh yeah yeah yeah "
"i'm gonna thank you"


Yes man
Fuck that
Yeah
Yeah
Hey yo
Hey yo
I smoke on the mic
Like smoking Joe Fraser
Holding a blunt with a scope
And blaze shit up
Much more harder to those
We like barbers and hoes
Flow is like
Hard shit
Yeah
I'm unstoppable the rhyme is hollow tip
Throws while i post it
We gotta hit
While i take shots at
Chat Fiend
Its like selling poison
Upside inside the mind
Nigga anything Raek says goes
Limp Bizkit shit
Mix together
You are convinced
It's frozen
When the hit store
Mix together metal and rap
Can't you do better than that
At one of our shoes
But on the other hand we like you
Don't bring your clan or band
We fight you
You might get a gunshot
Rock and rap ready to rock
Putting more on the map


I terrorize with these eyes
All you players on the sidelines
Get victimized
Ain't no mamma on this planet
Who won't cry
When you see the baby boy sucking thumb and
Licking crumbs from their eyes
Switch on the blade
Pay the price pull the pin
What this hand grenade splash
I think i warned you again
Take another route
Devils waiting for the handshake
Better sell me
Cuz i'm gonna lead you to the gate
Unforgivable
Got shot
You invisible
Typical
Ridiculed
Motherfuckin' pitiful
You don't know the half of these bitches im going through
Bullet proof
Pull a tooth
Spiting juice
Take a shot
Naked absolute
When i'm through
You is through
Speaking all that i know is true
Blowing through this revenue
Something you can never do


I all I want
Maxin' in the wind
Sweeties that match the black bed
Stay relax in a black tent
Roll runners gunners that throw hundreds
Soldiers get so blunted
Flex and drop bombs code wanted
I all I want
Maxin' in the wind
Sweeties that match the black bed
Stay relax in a black tent
Roll runners gunners that throw hundreds
Soldiers get so blunted
Flex and drop bombs code wanted


Oh!
Got you haters feeling like we do
Oh!
Got you feeling like we want you to
Oh!
Got you haters feeling like we do
Oh!
Go you feeling like we want you to
You got that right
Raekwon on the show
Limp Bizkit 2021
Mathematics on the beat
I could listen to this all night
All day
Everyday
Just rewind it




I mean yeah, nigga! It's feeding time!
It's getting warm outside, these niggas, like to put they earrings in, and pull they chains out and shit
(Put the bibs on these niggas!) Let's go!


Nah, you don't roll enough
Louis duffle bag don't hold enough
Drinking the brown liquor for both of us
Rose on table, Jesus head with the cable
Gun shots is fatal, my bars is prenatal
I kill little niggas, up close, peel little niggas
We the hottest out, still, little niggas
I'm better in my prime
Spitting harder, looking better than ya'll little niggas
And I done been here a dime
Your opinion didn't matter since Big heard me rhyme
Little nigga and Puff, or caught a spot with a nine
Hand all sticky, my tires is all Mickey
She kissing on my neck, I'm too black for a hickey
I'm still down with Kobe, got a feeling he could make it
If Miami and Oklahoma don't take it
Your face found up, like I won't come there and break it
Jake the Snake and hatchet, can't Crystal Lake it


Most of my goons is bow-legged, bald head niggas
From Syracuse, four-fifths, gold plated
Doing lines off coffee tables in the Waldorf
Nose red, walk into to the bathroom, door off
My man said I went raw last night
Heard I slid up in a whore last night
Still saucy, I plead the fifth, six G's I sniffed
If I sneeze, the left side of my nose might rip
Dark skin, hunchback killing machines
You eat seal meat, dick stay up for a fucking week
Attending brutal rap battles in Zaire
I heard "Toney, Boombaye!" from the crowd, yeah
My man head ice, luck smooth right there
Blood diamonds sitting real chunky in my right ear
Killas, skin your ass with no contracts
And little niggas got nowhere to hide but the projects


I just woke up, I got money on my mind
Grab my nine from underneath the bed
I put my vest on, smoke something
Cock my gun back, make sure it's filled up with lead
I'm coming for your head, I'm coming for your head
I'm coming for your head, yup, yup
I'm coming for your head, I'm coming for your head
I'm coming for your head, yeah


Ralph Ellison, invisible man, vanishing
Come back like Arizona Ron, speaking Spanish
And you're panicking, oughta stay still like a mannequin
Dark side like Darth, yeah, young Anakin
Skywalker, fly talker, rhyme even better though
Salute them niggas that died, those with a federal
Charge yo, Incarcerated Scarface, yard flow
Polo overalls, short set, son of Mars, though
Probably in the crib, getting high, watching Fargo
A lady cop and some hit men
I quarterback the coke like Big Ben
To a bunch of a dirty niggas like Pig Pen
No Charlie Brown, though, pump in the pound, though
Coming for your head, I run your ass out of town, yo
This is Sheek Louch, Ghostface Killah
And the other Ghost, you can fuck around and get your mother poked


Bees wax all in the spinners, most of my killas is winners
Hiding in Stevie glasses in Venice
Blast first, drop the burner and burst
Burgundy blood, fell out the thug, he got trapped by a team curse
I'm more relentless, aiming a strap, from off the benches
Hit you from right field, intensely
Your money ain't long, your money is gone
Your money mine now, homeboy, now run to your moms
Sorry gangstas get thrown in the hole
We chilling in the Trump Towers, onions and soul
Let's roll, cuz when the clock hit, my niggas'll bowl
It's like dice, nigga, open the hole
Fisters on the get go, silk shirts, this is how the click roll
Strong hammers, doofy like Klitschko
And where your bitch go?
Surrounded by the rich, yo
Power mitts and bricks, yo, what






Bare with me, don't turn against me
What I mean is that I'm caught up in the Conflict of Love
Bare with me, don't turn against me
I'm just a baller, some call it the life of a thug


Yo, yo, aiyo, I play the block like I'm homeless
Bold in the the fourth corners, strong, I think I'm in the zone bitch
I might embarass you, want me out my character
Mommy I ain't mad at ya, you said I'm too gangster
Yo understand why I do what I do
Understand why I move when I move
Could of had anybody in this world but I'm fuckin' with you
Ma' respect how I hustle and move
Listen shorty it's simple, "I don't love you, I like you
I don't wanna fuck you or pipe you and I don't wanna wife you
I got a wife at home, and if she find out
A nigga fouled up shorty she gon' wild out
She liable to flip, liable to punch holes in the whip
Take me to court, sue me for half my shit
And listen shorty I don't need the drama
Slay be the king at that", who be the King of Rap?
I guess we soon to see

Chorus


Before I start it let me pop my collar
If you ain't feelin' how I move baby dial 1-800 then holler
I'll chill for a minute, get morge for my music
Write more initially, blow as I intended
I lace you with a bank account Bill Gated up
Drop wallets in that Cuban shit, raise it up
Ghost Ben Javer, Toney Starks stayed
Still it's not enough for all the love I gave
And all the bitches that be fiendin'
The meanin' is crawl right between 'em
Do nasty things, be mean to 'em, without even G'en them
I asked the father to forgive me, right before I put the key in him
And now I feel guilty, it's only you and that's why I feel guilty
My Clan be tellin' me that you gon' kill me
Fuck it, I'll buy you a fur, feel me?

Chorus


Remember this very night you said "hold on"
Hold on, hold on
Straighten up your face, don't turn the other way
Be strong heyaayayaayay


Yo, hey you'se a snotty little arrogant bitch, ain't you?
Relax big head I'm not Bird Man, lower that, thank you
I'm money, the ring that I copped you was to spot you yo
I'm helpin' your mother, just chill out, I got you
You could say "life is a hoax", picture me fallin' back bein' broke
I'd rather be woke, and I'd rather be buyin' a boat
Livin' like two rich African people flyin' in dope
Now if money gon' get us in trouble
You better chill out now, and have you a drink and order me a double
And I'm still gonna look out
And you can walk on the 95, frontin' with your cheap pocket book out
Break out

Chorus




Wow I smelt the pussy up, awesome
I came with a bang, filled the condom up, Rae you a bossman
Right in front of Saks, flagging me like she knew me for years
Im from academies where niggas dress casually
Ass was thunder, hips curvy, the wizzy was thirty
Dizzy bird who worked the Walt Disney in Germany
Fly green eyes, a black woman
Known to attack men, catch them in their lies, call it perjury
Dress her ass off and dance
An R&B queen who love hard niggas rhyming, she a fan
Everyday we fuck, Im intrigued by that
Her outfits was mean, she went to sleep in
I fiends for that then we fuck, fuck
Boo let me get some juice, what what
Keep it moving just fuck me, thats enough, enough
Fuck me in my ass and I bust
Busted on her ass, Im in lust


Since I met you, Ive begun to feel so strange
Every time I speak your name, thats funny
You say that you are so helpless too
That you dont know what to do
Each night I pray there will never come a day
When you up and take your love away
Say you feel the same way too
And I wonder what it is I feel for you


(Could it be Im falling in love?)
With you, baby
(Could it be Im falling in love?)
Woo
(Could it be Im falling in love?)
With you
With you
With you
(With you)


I dont need all those things that used to bring me joy
Youve made me such a happy boy
And honey, youll always be the only for me
Meeting you was my destiny
You can be sure I will never let you down
When you need me Ill be around
And darling youll always be the only for me
Heaven made you specially






It's the spot, he knew what the fuck he do
Fuck I told you about coming in here, man
We told you not to wear, no them furs, man
Up in here man, them shits is fresh off the racks, idiot


So much haze we hitting, counterfitting sit on the couch riffing
Need more rovers in the building, for more bitches, to give out
Names getting bigger, these flames'll come out quick --
Fuck Crystal, Crug' is the new shit, drive up in the whip
Light a new L, I like the blue liquor
Chase it down, like a nigga chased out of town
Jakes got a nigga down, laced in lemon lounger
For all the Cash Rule niggas, what's up niggas
Get your money, be respectful, we'll flip niggas
Who try to diss Chef name, a war about to come
I put it on my son, I'm not falling today
I got my acres up, scrapped up, 'town's my baby boy
Watch me Ving Rhames your mother, so straighten up
Cuz Wu's back, matter fact, Chef's here, yeah
He got the best ear, I'm not saying it's true or wack, yo
I play mine "Rewind the Time", memorize a fine line
Jump out with old Nike's and fine Klein

"I got to have it" - sample (4X)


Stainless steel, kitchen mill', fishing, we steal bitches
Twenty four hour funny, long as it's no money
I sware on Shallah's tummy, yo, I stay swelled up
Yup, or stay jailed up, for robbing them round oney's
Murderers act nervous, black weed, giving the love back
To every nationality and black seeds, I stand
Mack squeeze, hit the best rapper alive standing
Yeah, yo, whoever, this is Black Jesus...


Yo, call me back, man, call me back, man
We here banging up, like, fucking, seventy ounces
Give it to these niggas out of town, you heard?




Yeah, yeah (what up, what up, what up) What is it, nigga? {Let me get a sip of that}
(It's that dark right here, you dont want none of this, light that) That's that super black, nigga
(What's good, though, fam?) {Aiyo, turn that tv up} (Come on, man, you right there)
{Martin is on, right now, Martin on} (You got the remote) {We need new batteries for that remote, though}
(Ah man) {Yeah} (Aiyo, talk to them, Starks)


Henny bottles everywhere, smelling like 'yac
Bagging crack, sitting in the kitchen, wearing my mask
Robe on, tailored made in Italy, new Gucci denim
One slipper on, Brookstone, cushion
In the barn, number seven, hugging my neck, yo, Kiss, yo, Rae
Tell that yellow bitch I got next
She fucking with robbers, don't wanna hear her pussy sore like Tasha's, this is Starkers
Crumbs hitting the floor, fiends clicking they bic lighters
With Garfield eyeballs, pulling them all nighters
Give me fifty push ups, give ya'll a little piece
Faggots did a dime, niggas too weak
For fun, shove a Suzy Q in they face
Let 'em smoke a rock with cake on they head in the gate
He might die with a stem on him
Who give a fuck, I'm Larenz Tate on 'em


Crack spot stories, he put a kilo in the pan
I was about to break his hand until it came back tan
He dancing around the stove, Starks chilling in his rob
My hard knock life, I could of wrote that for Hov'
Shorty, give me a ginger ale and dutch masters
Matter fact, hand me the phone I'm bout to order Casper's
Fiends at the door, I'm too lazy to let 'em in
Turkey sandwich, barbecue chips, ESPN
Sitting on the couch, I'm just trynna do the match
She got ten polo shirts, all she asking for is half
Today was a good day, no one got shot
No police or none of that, that's how it is in our spot, yeah


Pyrex boys fronting in Rolls Royce's
I'm on the iPhone, leg back, examining choices
Two types of coke, we in the bathroom, voting
We like 'take it', helicopter waiting, we boating, yo
Gangstas to the death of it, humbling villains
A good hand chemist in twenty minutes, cake up and finish
This for the hallways, the long days, me and my whore, bagging up
Shorty more razors and bring out the four aces
Sit back, laughing with a stack and a clapper
She spray up everything, we paying Pataki
Drug house with no work there, the worst fear is never the thirst, yea
But set up for to the first of the thirty first, disperse, yeah
Beef, what, bring me a burger, ya
The flame broilers jump out, one to your first beer
So take that, over there
Everything, everything, just stay out of max clear


We got the trays up in 6E, that's usually where the God be
Me, Kay and J-Bop, Cali J, and Rod Lee
Bread clocking, all night, the heads knocking
No feds, just Kevin Tighe or west watching
Bagging up at the table, while we chit chat
Past the Phillie, wash your hands 'fore you hit that
Young niggas getting it, everybody G'd up
Other niggas only made sales when we read up
Motorola flip, burn out in the beeper
White Katie and Rhonda, Stacey and Shaniqua
Yeah, cocaine, weed and forties
That's when I was a shorty, crack spot stories

To Allah be the glory




Redskin leather, Indian sex
Pair of fresh Mocs on, lighting lear on my flesh
Let my arm roll, fresh off the honor roll, platinum bottles of Krug
All my niggas do what I got 'em for
Extra flashy grind, hit 'em with a crisp rhyme
Lines is nothing, blunt out, fuck him
All we know is jewelry and I mashed that, everybody excited
To see whatever bling on, smash that
Clever, more like a fox and ox together
Two stainless Glocks, rocks and a feather
Yeah, I'm from the lead era, shoot at
Anything that move, and move out America
And all we ever want is needed, seen it
Like a young Fillipino in Kuwait getting treated
Heavy horror armor, spike a bitch like her
Half a pound of good weed, then float through Gowanus
Brilliant master, sixteenth chapel in the Apple
Flooded up, Warridge wackos
Park Hillians getting hillions, that means millions
All on feet like Nigerian


Shallah, I got 'em
Heatseeking missile spit, don't even try to hide, nigga
Sizzle through your skin bars, call me cyanide, bitch
Try me if you want, homey, violation's a no-no
I am the health hazard, skull & bone, poisonous logo
Unleash the dragon, massacre the scene
I'm spitting, burn a hole through the speaker, and start melting the street up
Somebody please call the fire department
And I'mma strong believer, ya'll know that I ain't the one to start with
Cuz once the fuse is lit and we strike a match and the spark smell
My face bleed and we nam them up like ox tail
Ya'll see what's happening, ya'll know what the truth is
Somebody please ask Shallah Rae why he making me do this
Cuz once I finish dudes, it's unfortunate for them yappers
Throw them in the trash, they ain't no recyling bin for rappers
I microphone control, it's the current dominant factor
The records been bodied, I personally request the pastor, gone






What that nigga want, God?
Word up, look out for the cops though
Wu-Tang five finger shit
Cash rules-
Word up, two for fives over here, baby
Word up, two for fives, niggas got garbage down the way, word up, know what I'm sayin'?
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. get-
Yeah, check this old fly shit out, word up
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M.
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all
Take you on a natural joint
Here we here we go, check this shit, yo


I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I be gettin' the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this, son
Rollin' with this one and that one
Pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smokin' woolas at 16
And runnin' up in gates, and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
Catchin' keys from 'cross seas
Rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo, nigga, respect mine, or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-POW! Move from the gate now!


Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all


It's been twenty-two long hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask: what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
And ain't tryin' to hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic


Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all


Niggas got to do what they got to do
To get through, know what I'm sayin'?
Because you can't just get by no more
Word up, you gotta get over, straight up and down


Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money

That's right..
My nigga Clueminatti fuckin wit the intro, to murder somebody
We cheque-cash niggas wit four fingers on 'em
Callin the Lord, "Help me!", that's us
Thrustin through ya hood wit the dust (HOOOOO!)
Lord have mercy, niggas look thirsty, yo
End the swine, meet the inventor, plus the winter
It's mine, gasoline jump, just spiked gloves, nines
Watch my wave push, one chain faded out
Racin to Spain, half a million dollars in Boyd
Willy Aims, slap bop top of ya Glocks, plus black Reebox
Rockin real nigga shit, callin me Pops
Golden pro', kitchen designer shit
Chinchilla blankets, H. Winston anklets on
Drug dealer banquets, hands out, fire when we spit (Haha)

Roast ya ornaments, Super Bowl ring on each finger
Gettin fly, might linger, those of you ride
So let the lye sprinkle yo


Yo we put together like CREAM
Matter of fact like a Jamaican team
Sprangler stats, hatin like Mitch Green
Off the wall auction that dumb out
(We organize exortions)
Burn niggas labels down, frostin 'em


Eh-yo, how you like two Ac's?
Max in the trunk, lookin real dumb
Eighty-eight paper and our nose is numb
Prayed over Marvin Gaye's grave
He said Ghost, "Pop merked me at an early age
Hit Diana back in the days"
Them Supreme bitches all on my dick
Loved the way I sung the Cherells
"Mercy, mercy, son", made 'em cum
I wrote songs for the people
Verses that'll make Nixon resign
You can do the same thing with rhymes
"I swear Ghost is doobie, just imagine"
Check out what I started
Who's the first to rock 'fros with out a part in it?
Featherhats partin it, Gladys was the baddest, she wore a six
Pretty-ass foot with an arch in it
Big cars, slammin eight-tracks, slammin tracks
King died in sixty-five, Motown cried
Saw a tear drop from Stevie's eyes
Fogged out glasses
The plan was to bring together all the masses




DJ Clue.. Desert Storm
Fetch out.. Rip Right
Loud Records, Steve Rifkin, Epic
CLUE!


Money Mohammed Ali niggas who keep clean sneakers on
Beef and take niggas eats, streets brought all my features
Temped to clog bed rallies, imagine only seventeen wildin

Now I'm just lampin, just stylin out in Cali
Actin like raw is the mission, mission is to slap 'em
Bang jars, movin in psalms, manipulatin my accountant
Relaxin like.. blacks get jobs
Slangin in bangles y'all, chillin from all angles
Don rock more thank you's, gettin my shit washed
Elevator music, Rolex doors with thirty-seven whores
Countin the paper, takin y'all to walls




DJ Clue.. Desert Storm
The Professional, Pt. 2
Stupid! Fetch out.. Dame Dash
My nigga Jigga, Big Harper
You know how we do things, word up




El dinero manda sobre todo a mi alrededor, Cream consigue el dinero
Billetes de dlar para todos



Crec en el lado del crimen, el lado del New York Times
Sobrevivir no era un broma
Tena segundas manos, Mama rechaz al hombre viejo
As que nos mudamos a la tierra Shaolin
Una joven jueventud, meneando el diente de oro, Polo, Goose
La nica manera de conseguir "G off" era la droga
Y vamos a empezar as hijo, yendo con este y con ese
Apretando gatillos por diversion
Pero solo era un sueo de un adolescente que era un diablo
Empec a fumar "woolas" a los 16
Enfrentndome a puertas, y dando golpes por altas inversiones
Haciendo mi camino por salidas de incendios
Sin duda "speedara" por crack y hierba
La combinacin me hizo sangrar los ojos
Sin duda proveera e intentara conseguir toda la pasta
Atracando a chavales blancos en canchas de baloncesto
Mi vida no iba a mejor, el mismo maldito polo
Los tiempos son speros y duros como el cuero
Comprend que haba ido por la ruta incorrecta
As que me hice con locura de panda y sal
Pillando kilos atravs de mares
Dando vueltas en MPV's cada semana ganbamos 40 G's
Hey nigga, respeta lo mo o aqu va el TEC-9
Ch-Chick-POW, muvete por la puerta ahora

 x2



Han sido veintids largos duros aos de seguir en apuros
La supervivencia me tena nervioso, pero estoy vivo a la llegada
Echo un vistazo a la forma de las calles
Y me mantengo despierto para los caminos del mundo porque la mierda es profunda
Un hombre con un sueo, con planes de hacer "cream"
Que fall; fui a la crcel a los 15 aos
Un joven chaval vendiendo drogas y tal, que nunca tuvo mucho
Intentando coger un pedazo de lo que no poda (tocar)
El tribunal me la jug corto, ahora me las veo con el encarcelamiento
Paseando, yendo arriba es mi destino
Esposado en la parte de atrs de un bus, cuarenta de nosotros
La vida de un cro no debera ser tan dura
Pero mientras el mundo giraba aprend que la vida es un infierno
Viviendo en el mundo no diferente a una celda
Cada da escapo de "Jakes" persiguiendo, vendiendo base
Fumando "bones" en la escalera
Aunque no s por qu elijo fumar hierba
Supongo que es el momento en el que no estoy deprimido
Pero sigo deprimido y pregunto para qu vale?
Preparado para rendirme y ver la vieja tierra
Quien explic que trabajar duro puede ayudarte a mantenerte
Para aprender a vencer a la pena y el dolor
Tenemos nios atracadores, policas corruptos, y rocas de crack y
Balas perdidas, todo en el bloque que se mantiene caliente
Djamelo a mi mientras soy prueba viviente
Para ensear la verdad a la joven negra juventud
Pero los cros corriendo salvajes, fumando hierba, bebiendo cerveza
Y sin intentar or lo que les pongo en sus odos
Ignorado por ahora, pero yo, tiene que ser aceptado
El qu? Que la vida es agitada





(I told you a long time ago you fucking little monkey not to fuck me
(Hey hey, who the fuck you think you talking to huh??!)
(Who the fuck you think I am your fucking bellboy?)
(You wanna go to war?.... Wanna go to war, OK?)


Coming up on half a mil, we build
Get real y'all, taking you on another one Son
Uhh, Julio Iglesias
Making CREAM like that nigga


Yo, first of all son, peep the arson
Many brothers I be sparking and busting mad light inside the dark
Call me dough snatcher, just the brother for the rapture
I hang glide, holding on strong, hard to capture
Extravagant, RZA bake the track and it's militant
Then I react, like a convict, and start killing shit
It's manifested, the Gods work like appliances
Dealing in my cypher I revolve around sciences
The 9th chamber, leave you trapped inside my hallway
You try to flee but you got smoked up by the doorway
No question, I send your ass back, right to the essence
Your whole frame is smothered in dirt, now how you resting
While I'll be trapped by sounds, locked behind loops
Throwing niggas off airplanes cause cash rules
Everything around me, black, as you can see
Swallow this murder one verse like God Degree
Then analyze my soundtrack for satisfaction
You adapt like a flashback chain reaction
(Lace them niggas, son)


AK's black bust back like seventy Macs
I'm all that, street niggas knowing my steez black
Ron G, you know he coincide with me, see,
Marvelous menace for society
But anyway, let's toast, champagne thoughts with Ghost
I max the most shotguns through the nose
Fuck rap, hip hop put me on top
'Lo wears, and Tommy Hil fly shit with a knot
The witty unpredictable live shit, drive by shit
Do or die shit, I'll take your lye and shit
And then you know, I'm running through the penal, foul
Four-toothed child was wild
The old lady snitched, but fuck it, you know it, one love kid
No I'm not doing a bid
Too much to get for what cause six niggas got stuck
And the nigga chain was truck
Yo fuck that, Criminology rap
Sneakers stay jet black floating in the flyest Ac'
Nigga... bring it! Yeah


Much love go to New York City
All my Tommy Hil' ice rocking niggas




What you think I'm a fucking worm like you?
I told you, man, I told you, don't fuck with me
I told you, no fucking kids, no, but you wouldn't listen
Well, you stupid fuck, look at you now {Ya'll already know!}
(For real, ya'll, back behind the wall again) {yeah, you know what it is}
(You know what it do, '09 style this time) {It's time to go in now, ya'll}
(For real, making CREAM again, nigga... BLAOW!) {you already know, it's crunch time}


First of all, black park it, guns, we spark it
Hit you in the back of your dome, from far, kid
Dice kickers, gun clickers, run up in the bank for ones, quick
The drug dealer niggas, we flip 'em
Polo rugbies, flags on my hats, you love these
Knockout artists are one-piece
Fly in a foreign, all my money ties is tied-up
I'd rather sell coke, no bargain
Tough like a Hummer, fly like a Maybach
Spot runner, clap you in a gun shop, one up
Fuck about police, we Park Hillians with gold geese
And everyday's a Sunday Easter
Cousins in Gaza, the new improved Shottas
Stretched out, mink on the floor, you hassa
We run through with turbans, diamonded up chain with boots on
Mori umbrellas in Tucson
Rhyming is a color, the lifestyle is live, my fly brothers
Something go wrong, we slug something


Chill my nigga, chill (I got this, I got this)
Make sure you handle that beat, you know what time it is
Body that beat, man, come on (Yeah)


You can catch me anywhere, frost bitten chain
Bad dame, a thousand grams in Delaware
The smokeshop's is owls, laid back, hanging niggas to death
Word, you can call us coat racks
With 'giants' all around me like, Eli Manning
The bitch is on the block like, he died scrambling
Cuz L frames is crack, popped out, nina one of his eyes
Can't come back home, they locked out
All he did was re-up, hustle for kick money
Kept Beez all around him, thinking he shit honey
Bow, I'm into bobsleds, wasting large bread
Gucci helmet is blue, trim in his dark red
The rap TJ Swan, it's me Ason
If he don't spin my shit, break the DJ arm
And glide off like an escapade, renegade on ice
Lemonade Clark, the haze is nice
The Goldielocks, rocks sapphire, chain is right
Bitch niggas, ya'll watch what ya'll say in ya mics, suckas


Aiyo, Rae, aiyo, Rae, check it out, yo
Let me go in there one more time and air these niggas out
For old times sake, you know how we do, my nig'
Old times sake, just for me, man, one more time, I'm begging you
Let me just go in, and just fly on these niggas heads, man
It's what I'm talking about


It's like a body in a project hallway, who did it?
Who's the next nigga that sucked the snit-ich
That's my word, it could never be me
You see the deer head on the living room wall, like his neck fell off
That can be all sculptured and glazed with gloss
Call the shots that Bill Belichick would call
Snake niggas slither all in the glass house, racial slurs
When it's time to go to war, they cash out
Throw 'em in the rear-naked choke, they tap out
Niggas try to surround the kid, I backed out
And threw two rocks at 'em, watching the ho drop
I'm from a place where we locking the low Glocks
Yellowtape, the bodies, jiggy and road blocks
Got the towels up in the air, it's so hot
Talking bout Staten Island, profiling
Switchblade city, the goons is wilding
Escape from my slums, nigga, you got talent
And we don't want the fifth of 'yac, we want the gallon


What you think I'm a fucking worm like you?
I told you, man ---


Vacate black, bust gats, wherever we at
You all that, hit 'em in the chest, we fall back
I got mines, nigga, where yours at?
We call that, raw rap, got fiends in front of my door mat
That Witty Unpredictable fly shit, drive-by shit
These the niggas I ride with
And we gon' get cake, ya'll, as soon as this pie split
Smacking up the dry snitch, nigga, you my bitch
Somebody put Tical on, matter fact, put Tical on
One suuu, Staten Isle on 'em
I bank roll, I break codes, and I ain't trynna catch another case, case closed
Give me my crown, cuz I deserve it, real dudes giving me pounds
But not too close though, the semis'll round
Bitches, running they mouth, goons, running your gate
My team running the block, cops running my plates
Well fuck that, Criminology rap
Niggas hate, I hate back, floating in the flyest Maybach, nigga




From shooters in buildings to coupes in the pavilions
Play wealth, keep your health and your heart first
The belt that's been passed on the last car collision and cracks
We was there rolling up, holding duffle bags, that's facts
Blood on his Fila's,  Levi's
Laid there, two chains on, where's the throne
I was slick, like poets who know his shit, cold as shit
Thugs that stay loaded then blow throughout the global quick
Fast money and sneakers, cool out king silks on
Right in front of the Flash Gordon, you crabs goners
Stealin' styles so we taxed him out on Billy Childs
The bodies was ripped from water, twist the chalice
A grown folks game to the older folks
Grey haired gangsters rockin' New Balance
See the chodes, a few challenges
Money spill, heads tumble, thugs rumble, drugs crumble
But still I'm still upon in bankers trust, thankin' us
Preparing my speech, pulled up in a peach Corniche
Seats are burgundy, soccer gear and Louis cleats
Hand me my medals, Pussy he just laughin' at us
I know you wanted my bitch, but money won't attract it
They trained, pullin' pistols see the aims
It's desert shark, that blow apart flesh and bones when it starts
The originator, cuban linx chains, diamonds and clarks
Swim on this crime wave where bags of money get washed


They say Loyalty's golden and it will make you rich
Well, I'm royal, my cloth is purple, I never switch
High chief, low eyes and hella jewels
Word from the wise, it's time to rise and show and prove


Getting money is easy, keeping it that's the hard part
Creeps and scavengers roam the land, call 'em aardvarks
Go ahead and try me now, filthy rich Africans
From the slums' glorious days, I bring the action in
Long hair Brazillians love swallowing my childrens
Selfmade poet, poetry constantly bringin' millions in
Scratch that small talk, meetings with the higher ups
Walls necessary, cemetary bitch and bury chumps
Spark a  and sip the champagne for the pain
Let's celebrate, this duffel bag snatch your dime piece bag another coffin though
From the era where the code is 'never trust a hoe'
My advanced stride is the coldest, yo
Ritual's get the bread and stay upon your square
For the leeches and the sly foxes please be aware
'Cause they will pray upon your shortcomings
Jeopardise the family's heir
Here's the first glass, sip it to hell, I'll see you there


They say Loyalty's golden and it will make you rich
Well, I'm royal, my cloth is purple, I never switch
High chief, low eyes and hella jewels
Word from the wise, it's time to rise and show 'em proof




You've practiced 20 years? You must be extremely good then
Perhaps, you'll try with me


Come and taste my seasonin', Chef, the cooking that is marvelous
Back over a stove, makin' your mouth water, you starve for this
Exclusive sneakers with hard denim, heavyweight
A neighbor illustrated Alex Haley with paper (paper)
Waves spinnin' like the Titanic, come take a float on
Silky like King Henry VIIIs robe in late spring
Restaurants with skeleton keys, it's big business
Well groomed and elegant posture is real dapper
Status is gigantic, culture's alpaca
Meetings in the Vatican, drinkin' scotch with the Muscle Milk
Praises go to Ason, the dynasty Mr. Russell built
Feed me royal shottas with Glocks, clean 'em with GT Oil
China dolls from Bangkok, we bang 'em, train 'em and make 'em loyal
Trees stank, she come kiss the top of my Yves Saint
Wise-Universal Tang when I bang
Grizzly with the big bank, it's 5 stars, y'all, when I call rank


Egos are somethin' that the Wu-Tang crush
These stupid jealous niggas, y'all 'bout to get rust
This ashes to ashes to dust to dust
These derelict MC's cannot fuck with us, Lord
Egos are somethin' that the Wu-Tang crush
These stupid jealous niggas, y'all 'bout to get rust
This ashes to ashes to dust to dust
These derelict MC's cannot fuck with us, Lord


Rifles out, bear like the Russian
Octagon tuggin' silk drawers frontin', while her head stuntin'
Mulsannes flood the garage
Man the goats launchin' charge cards from Africa
Catch me in the hookah lodge
Brains linked, twisted Cohibas, say the seeds bang
Coffee pots with graveyard rings, flippin' Gs
Yankee hoodlum on the top of the charts
Dart throwers, they're sharks
Everybody run
When my gun barks


Non-athletic anti-semetic synthetic rappers get no credit
Pathetic septic lines, incompetent styles not embedded
Wu-Tang slang bangs in your brain, this is not genetic, prophetic
Unadulterated talent while y'all talk that bullshit rhetoric


Egos are somethin' that the Wu-Tang crush
These stupid jealous niggas, y'all 'bout to get rust
This ashes to ashes to dust to dust
These derelict MC's cannot fuck with us, Lord

Where is the money? Ha ha...




(Yo, what up law, wassup, wassup baby? Talk to me)
Yo, Shorty yo, it ain't even like it's really, it's really, messing with me son
But it's messing with me, man, for real man
(Aight, but you know what? Don't even let it get to you
Like you told me, birds is birds
After you lovin 'em, they fly away, son)
They fly, yeah yeah, you're right, you're right
(KnowImean? It's like that man) Yeah
(Word up!)


One in the morning tryin to sneak in
Caught the weace and start beefin, I'm leavin
And leave, stop speakin yo, no static
Go get that shit up in the attic
That old shit look better, kept it so you have shit
The ice, take it off, no loss
Knew you was an Indian giver nigga
Besides, that's the way I floss, yea
I'm buggin now, actin like an old lady
It's real, a nigga got mines, she sleepin without pagin me


Baby, relax, sit back and chill (yeah)
Just give me a second
And let me tell you how I feel
Cause all around town you've been steppin' out
Runnin' your mouth about
What made you think I wouldn't find out?
Wasn't I there for you?
Truly cared for you
Maybe my love was just too good
Could've had it good, now the love is gone
And went back to your hood with the 54-11's on


Does he lace you with the finer things?
Does he make ya wanna scream his name?
Does he hit it from the front to back?
Did you let him break it down like that?
Should've told me the love was gone
Never thought that you'd do me wrong
Girl I though that your love was strong
Till I saw you with another man


No more shopping sprees
No more late night creeps
No more VIP's, no more dough
We can't even kick it no more


I saw you on the Ave' in the Nav'
In the backseat B's, spilling Henney in his lap
Thought it was me that you was all about
But I'm having doubts cause I see you tryna play me out
But when the brother called the crib with beef
Didn't I represent you when I caught him in the streets
So let me get the keys to Lex and no more checks
And no more hanging baguettes around your neck, babe






Uh-uh
You heard that
That's right
Yo, yeah, come on
And that's a no-no
Yeah, eh yo, eh yo, eh yo, eh yo


You met me with a big blow out
African bangel, left hand Gucci, ling braces on my ankle
At the shark bar we at Shaq shit
Ballplayer stats, 40 plus, son hit twenty-somethin baskets
Turn for a second, stop! Son caught my eye, yo 'vine!
Bet you out bag her on the first stop
Peace booby, love you beauty, rock yours truly
Ghostface and who is she? That's my girlfriend
I want you and your girl to grab me, Tonka's
Be careful boo, I got carrots on (Word!)
Carry on, so we stepped back to the bar
The disc jockey threw in the car
Toxi' seen me, so what time is it?
Your back was out, passin we bounced to the powder room
Beggin me, I fucked you for an hour in the room
And when we finished, you was on stuck
Jamal Arief came through, started dartin
And you jumped up in my man's truck




For real
Ghostface Killah, Ruff Endz
No doubt! Y'all know how we do




Millionare stance, ?vansens? on, handsome dons
Hittin Branson, calm them niggas down
Yo my favorite rock record was Queen
Another One Bites The Dust, we spray around
Live niggas get hit, the abulance come and take your shoes off
We got him in the bed, he's a clown
While my record sales is wildin, niggas up the block bitin my style
Vito Corleone of Staten Island, Manhattens mine
Shoot, we got the 2006 sky blue nines, and got dimes
Go ask em, whatchu wanna do for your plates?
Then blast em, take a picture of em and stash em, wait
Another thought came to me, the Cuban Link album
You should be in Malibu, straight
Sat back blowin Corolas lookin real hood, real hood, real hood, one




Gary got robbed from a Jew man with his playboys
Them same boys, July 4th, popped shots and made noise
Jay got set up by some chick for his white goose
While ??? mixed crack and weed, said it gave him a life boost
Betty was my first fuck, Lenny said he had the worst luck
Got bagged with lots of weight, swervin in the Hertz truck
Columbian jackets and JanSport book bags
Golden age rap era, when the South Bronx looked bad
I just signed a record deal and I was homeless
These New York City streets make it so easy to find opponents
Cats wanted my sheepkin fame and tried to shank me
Back when Phil Rizzuto was callin games for the Yankees
Back when dealers was just as famous as the rappers
And C. Delores Tucker used to blame us for disasters
I'm here to bridge the gap for ya'll between then and now
And finally figured out that when I write, my pen is power




So ya puttin' all ya subs now, huh?
Yea, ya doin' real good?
Ain't you gonna introduce me to ya friend, here?
Well I'll introduce myself, excuse the glove

"Get ya shit beaten" - Prodigy of Mobb Deep (sample repeated)


Aww shit, these niggas out here, hold that
Picture that nigga, all the real niggas, yo, come on
Yea, word up, I look good right?
Yo, aiyo


Put my money on the real kings, reveal the rings
Rocks swing, stayin' bling-bling in Ossining
Jet mack packages, feast to light it up and beast it
Cordially invited, the motto is eat this..


Yo, what up, Lex? (What up son?) Yo it's on again
Yo, it seem like niggas want war again
If you ain't know, bet ya niggas heard of me now
Can't stop me, best bet, murder me now


Aiyo Lex, put ya diamonds on
Grab ya vests and ya nine, cuz it's on
I rep Harlem World where they hustle at
All the way to B.K. where they bust you at


Yo, yo, gun on 'em in the x-rays
Real niggas lay tired of it
Nigga violate it, cut him in the face
Vivid hand Glock, loopin' the dance, shoot him in the ass
Like cupid, dealin with an old place, stupid


Yo, yo, ain't a team allowed to know, fuckin' wit this
Niggas mad like I'm fuckin' they chick
See me stuck in the whip, gun in the hip, one in the head
Ten in the clip, niggas is dead, they imposters


I used to bubble dimes, in the goose, I use to cuddle nines
And double the fact that you dare think that you can trouble mines
Big guns is layin', Timothy McVeigh 'em
Broad day 'em, push 'em all the way in


Aiyo, dred's in the bloody rep
Yeah, yellow canary Lex', specs on, movin' like vets
Tri-boro, thoroughest thugs move like DeNiro
Heat out, extortin' the heroes, 4/5 singles


Aiyo let's go get dough
Bust slugs in the club, thugs get low
Bitches showin' me the thong like I'm Sisqo
Up in the six, yo, watch his wrist glow, damn, it be sick though
This be the shit though
You ain't know, got ya moms in the disco
Singin' the intro, shakin' the ass like the nympho
Time to move, nigga, we in, time to catch wins


For magical mixes, remix the hell outta the Bible
Like strip it and switch the whole title
Robes hit the floors, shoes is buffed
Gold studded bracelets, handcuffs, they gave it up


Teach niggas how to resolve a big mob
Keep niggas on beat, fuck around and di-ie the mid-ob
Niggas gonna bump what, yeah, you wit it whatever
Let's body these niggas, a lot of niggas bump, yeah


Yo, yo, never been the type to hold a grudge
Did five, I was guilty, fuck the judge
The Ave. got mad when I slid back through
Iced out, just came home and I blew


We like, them frisky, rich and poet-esque
If it's chilly on our neck, then it's cold on our wrists
The cash flow is nuts, come through 8th Ave
Another hundred style, burn out for doughin' us


Aiyo, the hood's off the hook, hooded up crooks
Play the back burner wit black burners layin' for the juks
I'm too live, heats be the same as my shoe size
Fresh out the box, just copped a pair of new nines


Yo, my team is like nitro, it might go boom when the lights blow
Catch you in the spinal wit the same knife from Psycho
My mic flow like Michael on the ball court
All pro, result of this Cream Team, niggas is all out




Aiyo, rep for ya town ("Get ya shit beaten")
Uptown, break it down ("Get ya shit beaten")
Staten Island, break it down ("Get ya shit beaten")
B.K., break it down ("Get ya shit beaten")
Queens and Bronx get down ("Get ya shit beaten")
Throw ya hands up right now! ("Get ya shit beaten")
("Get ya shit beaten")




And I say one for the money, 3 for the show (roll up)
Because we know that all the bad bitches smoke (vibe wit me)
You competition is past fictional
Gettin stopped like a bad pick and roll, magnifico
These niggas is getting old, my team too strong
Kevin knows, take you out your zone, I'm the new don
And the only polo I know is Ralph Lauren
Put me on the court with the opposition - I'll outscore 'em (easy)


Try not to use cash so my checks serve a purpose
Every time I sign for a blessing I use my cursive
Got scruffs on my Timbs for a dollar so it was worth it
Cocaine white suits, see an angel before we murk him
Hog for the work, niggas' eyes love to lurk
I got a bitch named cal, she 'bout 40 and love to twerk
Nothing changed, range aiming at your frame, nigga
Ain't a clause when dear to reign get you slain nigga


Prices turnover the code like da Vinci, no nigga tempt me
Generational curse of chugging whiskey 'til it was empty
Drive-bys out the four-door Honda, dreams of a Bentley
Pockets full of dead white men, I pray the master don't lynch me
Step your game up - You wifed her, she been a rat
I text her at the crack of dawn, tap-tap it and send her back
My granny, momma, sister, cousin bedroom was up in that trap
Is them drugs up on my counter? "No momma, that's Similac"


Yo, I just spent like 30k today, I ain't gon' front
See I came up from the bottom, I'mma get everything I want
See the homies, I'mma holla, nothing changed I rolled a blunt
Told 'em now it's time to eat cause we've been starving days and months
And it's a must that we can trust nobody but us
We ready to bust if enemies come
But I can realize that this this ain't what you want
See I do this shit for fun, screaming HS87 'til I'm done
Ha, now I'm done


Stop the beat, here comes the starter
Grab your popcorn, grab your water
Grab your daughter, cause she watching cause I start like Mr. Carter
Say I'm ballin' like a man, finger on the trigger
Got money all in my pocket, I'm a I-E nigga
Name Oktane, that nigga Oktane to be exact
You hope to hear from a real nigga one day, well this is that
I got that crack and I got that X R E, AK
And I got my back, Tony Montana give em that brrrat
HS87 nigga that's that, I'm done


No need for me to getting involved
You'll get hit with a bat and wrapped in a cloth
Uh, razor blades, shanks and fades
Everybody on the floor or they K'd
Uh, my young gliggity-Glock got on my crotch
Stay ready and cocked
Can't wrap me in a bag, I'm going pop
New Rollie, so heavy metal
Want a rock? Gotta hustle nonstop


Look, wash yo hands before you shake mine
You was talking shit I heard it through the grapevine
Yeah, it's a lot of boppers on the sideline
So the young baller had to go baseline
I'm a black nigga with money like Akon
You mad the squad winning that's a hate crime
Peas and carrots, live and grow, that's my day job
Young Veggie attract hoes like a Drake song


California, Christopher Dorner manifesto
Hit-Boy, hip-hop I started on the metro
But now I'm in that retro, Ferrari two-seater
With the pedal to the floor, got it singing like Aretha
If you scared, get a dog or a preacher
Hit the hot spot with a bitch resembling Mona Lisa
Priceless, I'm righteous, I walk the talk
I am cooked cocaine, you are softer than chalk
Cause your bite ain't as bad as your bark
After dark, you inside like an embryo - I swim with the sharks
Cause when I smell blood in the water
I'm taking over like the New World Order, witness the gangland slaughter
Bitch


(Maybach Music)
Still sipping Ros back seat of the Rolls
Kilos on the Cuban link, they thought it was Hov's
Fascinated with gold, sneakers and talented hoes
Before you get to cruise you paddle the boat
Elevated to elevators, had to walk flights
Young niggas lick shots for them Air Nikes


Ride with me, although the driver's tipsy
Avoid them officers calling 50s to get me
They call me talk of the city, never talk the jiggy, man
I'd rather talk to Whitney, condolences to Bobbi Krissy
Balling I'm forreal, I got NBA skill
Make you feel a little scrappy with the Stevie J grill
And y'all ain't gotta ask me if it's Homicide Hill, nah
Don't even ask me - this is Homicide Hill


I'm from the era of Biggie Smalls, TLC's "Waterfalls"
Buying dimebags by the mini-mall
I got your whole city logged online
Disrespect mine, I be throwing ones like a titty bar
You fucking with a grown man, boy
I plug two like Trugoy, send that memo on your Android
For 10G, you can talk to the boss
My experience, I'm like Jordan on the court, nigga


Pyrex pots and Guess shorts
Yo, weed flow is the best sport
Now I'm underwater flipping quarters
The code to go tackle the globe
Black Mac in the robe
Metal mag cold straps, shit is gold
Partyville and Hennessy fiend
I'm blessed, it was a dream
He had his team moving tight like skinny jeans
You know, by any means
We will bring the magazines out and clap everything down like little geeses
All ride with ninas, cooling in cuisines
Yo the whores is giving top in the back, I ordered wings
Spray shit up to smithereens
Stepping off they sway shit
Shake your hand, blow you head up in killa Queens
Yo, the dons know what it do
I'm just that fly in the interview
Wintertime grinding it seems
Remember the pledge of allegiance
To the team with more reasons, more firepower, and more squeezes




Yo, aiyo, yeah nigga, what up
I can't do this shit!


Yo, some nights I feel like sticking up Exxon
My gun game experience, came from robbing Louis Vitton
Cocaine specialist, since nine
Age bracket, fuck them O.G.'s up, they started giving me ratchets
Get money Diamonds, co-signing all of my check stubs
Besides getting money, I grub
I had a Kool G. Rap lifestyle, sliding through the Parrot with drugs
I'm like a magic with witchcraft, ya'll give a nigga rich cash
Blankets, anklets, Gucci shit, switch labs
I'm powerful, yo, you know my hour is due
Fuck the fifteen minutes, I'mma flower my boo
Word to my Nike's that I throw on pose, from here to Hollywood
You know I got soul like that Rakim dude
Just give me my money, ya'll owe it to me, don't make me blow you for it
For real, I'mma show ya'll niggas how to swoll dummies
High profile, he keep it macked out, hundreds of little niggas engage with him
And he gets down, aiyo you fucking with the best of the year
The best whoever did it, no love lost
Beside my shorty and child, I'm like a king in an Egyptian center
Militant, to play your perimeter, hold wifey now before I get her
You know what Wu do, RZA, tell 'em, now we got, Dre in the kitchen, son
It's on, Part Two, watch me sell 'em
Cuz New York is me, homey, watch me throw the crown in the trash
Whoever wore it, ya'll ass, 'member me, Toney, what up, what up
You know my gun game's zid up
Supplying every borough my cocaine river
Flashy always, I'm like four ways, none of ya'll see me fresh
I only do it in, project hallways, ya'll all gay
Ya'll know it, yes, that's what it be, peace
See me in streets, God be there, all day, one


I'm out of here, man, fuck that
It's on, Part Two, yeah, Part Two
Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo, I want my money in all fives yo, hahaha
Ice Wate, the new and improved Chef
Word up, the feist is coming soon, one
I'm out of here...




A game of chess is like a swordfight:
You must think first before you move
Toad style is immensely strong
And immune to nearly any weapon
When it's properly used it's almost invincible


Raw I'ma give it to ya, with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
Like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MC's approach with slang that's dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushin' force, my force you're doubtin'
I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains


Well, I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary and carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum, and the isle I'm from
Is comin' through with nuff niggas and nuff guns
So if you wanna come sweatin', stressin', contestin'
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk
I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain, there's no way to barricade me
Steamrollin' niggas like an 18 wheeler
With a drunk driver drivin', there's no survivin'


Rough like Timberland wear, yeah
Me and the Clan in 'Yota Landcruisers out there
Peace to all the crooks, all the niggas with bad looks
Bald heads, braids, blow this hook
We pack chrome TEC's, nickel-plated MAC's
Black AC's, drug-dealin' styles in phat stacks
I only been a good nigga for a minute though
'Cause I got to get my props and win it, yo
I got beef with commercial-ass niggas with gold teeth
Lampin' in a Lexus, eatin' beef
Straight up and down, don't even bother
I got 40 niggas up in here now who kill niggas' fathers


My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Bees on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats


Here I go, deep type flow
Jacques Cousteau could never get this low
I'm cherry bombin' shits BOOM!
Just warmin' up a little bit, vroom vroom
Rappinin' is what's happenin'
Keep the pockets stacked and then, hands clap and then
At the party when I move my body
Gotta get up and be somebody!
Grab the microphone, put strength to the bone
DUH DUH DUHenter the Wu-Tang zone
Sure enough when I rock that stuff
Huff? Puff? I'm gonna catch your bluff tuff
Rough, kickin' rhymes like Jim Kelly
Or Alex Haley, I'm a Mi-Beetle Bailey rhymes
Comin' raw style, hardcore
Niggas be comin' to the hip-hop store
Comin' to buy grocery from me
Tryin' to be a hip-hop MC
The law, in order to enter the Wu-Tang
You must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang
Represent the GZA, Abbot
RZA, Shaquan, Inspectah Deck
Dirty Ol' gettin' low with his flow
Introducin' the Ghostface Killah
No one could get iller


My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats


Speakin' of the Devil, psych!
No, it's the God, get the shit right
Mega trife, and yo, I killed you in a past life
On the mic while you was kickin' that fast shit
You reneged, tried again and got blasted
Half-mastered-ass style, mad ruff task
When I struck I had on Timbs and a black mask
Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack
That night, yo, I was hittin' like a spiked bat
And then you thought I was bugged out, and crazy
Strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy
Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs
Never shot thugs, I'm runnin' with thugs that flood mugs
So, grab your 8 plus 1
Start flippin' and trippin', niggas is jettin', I'm lickin' off, son


Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang!


Homicide's is legal and death is the penalty
One justifies the homicide when he dies in his own iniquity?
It's the master of the Mantis Rapture comin' at ya
We have an APB on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a master
Evidence indicates that his stature
Merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
The flow changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like a lie, paralyzin' the victim
You scream as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Movin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
And injure any motherfuckin' contender


My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats




You already know my style
Everything is real baby
Raekwon, all day, you already know

And on the way out you just blow my mind
Keep it up all night, dancefloor baby


Hey yo, ey yo
My sweet little princess
Your body i could level like a benchpress
Put you under my wing, I've been blessed

The day when we met I was seventy
Running with generals making moves
Then you came in my arms
Sexy little theiver
Body like Alia
Rockin' fly sneakers, wifebeater and the 
All i know is 
I'm all like Faracom a New York

Between me and you, I'd rather be 
This is my queen 







The kids from the hood is more dangerous
Everybody vest up, all the shot callers with aim, stick
The three pound, automatic is nasty, raspberry color
My shit bloody, with mud on my New Balance
Goodness gracious, more lazers, watch my family
Had these niggas, these niggas got more Rae shit
Three sixty weight, put somethin' in the air
He didn't die, but he copped the hearing aid, son
New shit, New Balance click, true blue sixes burst
The nurses in the joint, who school ninja's
The next paragraph might excite you, enlighten you
To get up, get hype a little, bust rifles, do him
I wrote it like that, to rock wigs, ox' kids
Boxes, cops is chasin' niggas to cribs
Vision the next verse is classy, ask me
How these young niggas get money, the tongue speaks so raspy, yo


Yo, ever had a fight with death?
Ever recognized you slept
Threw ya man out there and left
Ya'll niggas ain't never been 'built for' it
It's a shame, some niggas live
Then fucking get killed for it




Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know the deal, nigga
Sha what's good nigga?
Lex Diamond, your big brother here, you know
Let's work this shit out, man
Yeah, yeah, yeah, aiyo, aiyo


Fresh out the jungle where the blue boys run
We carry rugers, smoking toast on your throat like oolas
Hitting reefer, playing my square, windbreaker jacket
Holding my bear, rock and roll in my lear
I have to eat, gun carefully, let the cocaine bling
Strings is nothing, get your ho clapped, king
We hundred burners, onion turners, all this, came out the yard
With twenty five to lifers, loving my squad
You know the gun show off, whips is gleaming, clean as a fuck
In dirty hallways, the ninas'll cluck
This is crime station, my obligation is to look raw as ever
Feed my little sons and patients
Cuz they hungry, shining, bullet fly right through the lining
Catch me on the plane, humble and wining
Feeding me, fresh niggas, downtown, Brooklyn in them brook lands
Is Timbed up, looking for them jookes, with my miss and


Yo, the streets is a part of me
What you witnessing now is don archery
Pack a lambskin hostler, one of these rocks'll soft you over
You ain't nothing, you'se a bitch ass poser
Fiends on your face, on the T-shirt, thinking that you envy the P
Underneath'll be R.I.P
That's what you get, yo, for being so cocky
Two guns, thumbs up, for me and my posse


Yo, what's the science, little nigga? Yo, you beefing too hard
I throw five in your Champ hood, and envy your squad
You try to stick out your fucking hand, nah, I don't want no dap, nigga
Fucking lucky you ain't get glammed
Bitch ass nigga, you wrong, yo, you mingle with rats
The other day you got caught with the gat, nigga
How you home, nigga? Why you even up in my square?
Like you get busy, got the block hot and stare
Fresh coffins fast, they spitting, ya'll fake bitches
Snitches get mad love, hundred and eight stitches
My condolences, word life, if they can find you a real killa
Someone close is singing like the Jonases
Crime Stoppers, the tips keep pouring in
For a G, you be suprised who's going in
Block huggers, the ones who be holding they jock
And suck my cock, the real cock lovers




Ya'll can call me cook up or come back
My flow hot, my hood hot, cuz of one rat
My block on fire cuz of one match
I spit with paper like thumbstacks, these cougars wanna play all these
Young cats
With pussy, turning boys to men, so I resort to the pen
But at the same time, I'm pointing the pen
And now it's game time, nigga, you in? You better thicken your skin
Move with your peoples through the thick and the thin
I watch for po-po, they raiding the crib
And I ain't trying to get jammed, and have the next man raising my kids
God forbid, dudes be hating on his, because a nigga go hard
And hit 'em harder then they saying they is
But that's just New York, I carry the torch, just long enough
To light a Newport and carry this thought
Fuck what you thought, the bigger the boss, bigger the cost
They don't know about the Tribe of Shabazz, niggas is lost






Don't open that fucking safe, nigga
Yo, lord, yo, nigga what up
All this shit right here, turn that shit down, nigga
This school is the hardest school, B, what Dart School?
You know how to get a taste, man, calm down, man


So much colors on my ice, freeze the ghetto man
Me and my microphone knifed up in the Meadowlands
Skinny chain on, family, that's thirty grand
Dirty crown in position, yeah, worthy man
Bezels is like metals, nigga, hold the phantom
Convertible roof, hard headed, angry amber
If I'm pitching, giving bricks out to baby Rambo
I'm on Rodeo with yae yo, fifty baby hammers
The new shits that blow a building up, crazy damage
If it's priors, I do my own dirt, spray the cameras
So many soldiers, no soft niggas in the slammers
We run wild like 'lo gazelles and baby pandas
Small nigga with his gun rum, crazy gamblers
I'm uptown fronting, the fans know what gave me grammers
So when it's over I'mma fly to my lady mansion
And get riced up, some Japanese baby salmon


Blowing holes in your tipi,, little wise ass
We disguised as, some niggas who gon' rob, blast
Paint thousands of pictures, this my drive, smash
Guillotines, wolverins, fly assassins


Back and dogging this mic, give me my gwop, homey
I rhyme for under the stairs niggas who hate phonies
Keep it funky, I got to, it's kings only
Timberlands, hard denims, rings only
Rock a big ass gun, when you come from me
Your president of your country, yelling 'big dummy'
Chef a fly ass nigga, he cook every Sunday
He had a beef on the runway, making shit ugly
I had on alligators clarks, camouflage rugby
Bad bitch from Brazil, who fuck, never suck me
We was cooling in the Trump section, throwing bubbly
Got my niggas with the guns out, bowling lovely
When it's on, you gon' remember, ooh, you made him hungry
Top three of the east, nigga, well what, what, B
Pay for that mil, for real, max comfy
Or you'll be one of them niggas that say "son me"






Let's get it on Kokomo
John John Blazeini, Donna J-Bird
Yeah
Another Persian legacy

 The Iron Lung


Yo yeah, yeah, yo, yo
Dart throwing, yo aimin at your nostril, Aropostale
Sword rockin halibut steak we choppin
Mili-tia, eight to nine generals at one time
Fine we blend wine, go beyond one line
Spot the snakeskin, Dunn was scaley
Chopped his head off fuhrilly, sit back, crack the Bailey's
Wetter than white milk, grab the quilt - that's the heater
My nigga drop lost a stripe like adidas
Shit is deep, the bridge still burnin
The long time earnin, just got snatched by more Germans
Europeans are seein me bleedin, jet off in
The Lex skiin, goggles, Louis Rich Sweden


I dig my life experiences, wrap it up
In twelve inches, keepin my defenses
Put it up in raw trenches, holdin court on the park benches
In the ghetto servin life sentence
Mass confusion in New York, on these city sidewalks
Busy sidewalks, there's no snoozin
Stop actin like it's me losin, peep my modern day
Pompei on city streets, the Sun pack heat
In Hell's Kitchen, time to get money finger itchin
Once again plot thicken, and you succumb
To the will of the slum bite your tongue
Burn a bush with the Iron Lung, pay dirt to no one
Guilty by association, stank bitch
Wanna give me some, nappy nasty -- I pass
Let them players flash, and trick on they cash
On your funky ass I only buy shit that last
A lifetime I write rhyme, chippin through
The pipeline then it's flight time, that's when I'm jetty
In a fifty-seven Chevy, gassed on my own Getti
Head heavy, with deadly medleys


I opened up my rap Bible, then the light came
Over the children, as it began to rain
I started buildin, spoke many times before
But didn't score, my reading was poor
Injected with the Devil's english, I extinguish
And approach all hominyms, shit in your brain
Wipe my ass with the phenonmenyms, be holy
Or get shot down with the Moet-o, kid encyclopedia
Left y'all petrol, my dancehall standoff
Rap like Peter Metro, echo echo, what?
Beware my psycho, limw piece tec-o leggo
Uniform flow, stay strong black my shit is real
Peace out bro


Tical
Eyes as diamonds, time again
Motherfuckers wanna battle with the bat or pen
Give it to em raw, give it to em raw
Down to the fuckin floor, up to the roof with the proof
Meth-Tical mad, god damn!
Hahahaha, right
Motherfuckers

Hier wird das Geld gemacht, Geld ist Macht
Ich zeige dir das Leben auf der Strae, Director's Cut
Der echte Stuff, hier wird kiloweise Crack verpackt
Hier spricht der Chef der Stadt, der Escobar
Mein Rap ist hart, mein Rap ist ein Exemplar
Du rappst zwar explizit, doch ich fick dein Arsch
Extra Large, ich mach dich extra platt
Und du kriegst extra ein Bericht im Extrablatt
Doch schei auf Extra Mextra
Hier kommt der Gangster Mangster
Mit dem Geld aus dem Raub zum Investmentbanker
Ich kenne die Straen, kenne die Blocks
Kenne die Fressen, die Fotzen, kenne die Cops
Kenne die Dealer im Benzer, die mit dem Stoff
Kenne die Konsumenten, kenne den Koch
Hier ist alles vergiftet, es werden Menschen gekidnappt
Alles ist AusserKontrolle, es ist ein steinhartes Business


Das ist AK, das ist das was du willst
Das ist noch mehr als du wolltest
Das sind zwei rappende Kings
Es ist alles AusserKontrolle, wir kontern mit Bomben
Ficken euch Fotzen, behalten die Krone (30er Zone)

Wir sind schon viel zu lange in der Scheisse drin
Doch seit "Meine Stadt" wisst ihr wer wir sind
Es ist A, Krieg, mental, flieh
Du kannst nicht mit uns ficken, Junge, Metall fliegt
Hier ist alles verdorben, niemand hat ein Gewissen
Wir mssen Waffen besorgen, um das Ott zu beschtzen
Besorg das Acid in Wedding, vertick es weiter an Ecken
Wir mssen dicke Batzen machen, soll'n doch alle verrecken
Es ist ein dreckiges Business, du zckst fr Geld an die Spitze
Ich will 22 Zoll, CL, lederne Sitze
Ich will schicki micki, Klunker Munker, ficki ficki deine Mutter
Junge komm mal wieder runter, dieser Shit ist heavy, Boy
Nichts fr schwache Nerven, nix fr kleine Kinder
Hermann macht Abitur, Serkan sitzt hinter Gittern
Das ist eine kranke Welt, Ich rufe nach Gerechtigkeit
Doch bleibe nur ein Gangster in seinem Benz in einem Wendekreis


Das ist AK, das ist das was du willst
Das ist noch mehr als du wolltest
Das sind zwei rappende Kings
Es ist alles AusserKontrolle, wir kontern mit Bomben
Ficken euch Fotzen, behalten die Krone (30er Zone)

AK ist jetzt Stereo, du und deine Jungs sind ehrenlos
Komm uns nicht auf Bruder, wir regeln schon
(Wir sind regeros, deine Mnner reden gro)
(Ich komm aus einer Gegend, wo das ??? mit dem Leben droht)
Du bist ein Junge, der in einer reichen Gegend wohnt
Ich verkauf in deiner reichen Gegend Edelkoks
(Geh mit uns, gemeinsam diesen Weg ins Tod)
(Gib uns die Waage, die Ware und wir regeln's schon)
Doch wir regeln Geschfte nie am Telefon
Denn die Bullen in meiner Gegend nehm hier fast jeden hoch
(Ich bin nicht stolz darauf, doch wir nehmen blo)
(das was die Gesellschaft uns gibt, so ist das Leben, Bro)
Draussen auf Beton Rap, gib dir den Soundtrack
A Check K Check, AK Family, wir kill'n mit der AK Enemies
Gib uns die Hennessy, wir seh'n tote Kennedys

We are the G-O-D's
And we came to rock the spot
Like Ironman Starks
They be the illest MC's, in the world today
Cappa Raekwon and the R-Z-A
So listen to them clear, and put the box right near your ear
Light your blunts and down your beers
Cause you could never fuck with Wu-Tang Killer Beez

"From where we at to my man's cell
From where we at"


Say peace to cats who rock MAC Knowledge Knowledges
Street astrologists, light up the mic God, acknowledge this
Fly joints that carry two points, Corolla Motorola holder
Play it God, E-pack over the shoulder
Chrome tanks, player like Yanks, check the franchise
Front on my guys, my enterprise splash many lives
Repel all fakes like reflectors
He had sugar in his ear in his last crack career
We can can him, manhandle him, if you wanna
Run in his crib-o, get ditto, skate like a limo
And jet to the flyest estate, relate take a break
Break down an eighth and then wait, drop it like Drake
Thugs they be booing and screwing, we canoeing
Claim they doing the same shit we doing, fuck a union
It's the same style, RZA train a boy, jump the turnstile
On the island he tried to challenge God for the new bals
Especially that, aluminum bat in the Ac
Relax, lay back, sell a grenade a day, it pays black
The Mac-10 flex wipe cats like Windex
Index finger be sore busting these fly scripts
The Wally kid count crazily grands with our plans
Laying with my bitches and my mans in Lex Lands
We losing 'em, jet to the stash in Now Jerusalem
Abusing 'em, rocking his jewels like we using 'em
Low pro star, seven thick waves rock Polar
Roll with the older Gods, build with the Sun, Moon and Star


All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that shit that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring you Shaolin's finest
But if your skills are weak you better step behind us

"Ghostface--Ghostface Killah!!"


Mercury raps is roughed then God just shown like taps
Red and white Wally's that match, bend my baseball hat
Doing forever shit like pissing out the window on turnpikes
Robbing niggas for leathers, high swiping on dirt bikes
Voice be mellow like Vaughn Harper, Radio Barber
Murder sleep away camp, the fly lady champ
The arsonist, who burn with his pen regardless
Slaying all these earthlings and fake foreigners
In the Phillipines, pick herbal beans, bubbling strings
Biochemical cream, we burn kerosene
The conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon
Blond heads, inscriptions with three sixes in
Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive
I slapbox with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph
Zoom in like binoculars, the rap blacksmith
Money's Rolex, was rockless, Chef ragtop is spotless
I'm Iron Man no die-cast metal, I'm steel-alloy
True identity hidden inside secret tabloids
Breathe oxygen, both sides of my jaw carry oxes
The track hit like the bangers, in hundred watt boxes
Yo jostling these cats while Little J be deli-ing
Sip Irish Moss out of Widelians

"rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell"


All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that shit that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring you Shaolin's finest
But if your skills are weak you better step behind us

"Cappa-Cappa-Cappa-Cappachino"


Give me the the fifty thou, small bills
My gold plate, my slang kills
My beer spills, what up lils?
Murder one dun
Killer bee stung, guess who back home son
My technique of slang camp won, third platoon soon
Cristal bottles, cages of boom, Papi wardrobe
The mad-hatter big dick style, beware goons
Smuggle balloons, lornadoones in fat pussy wounds
Let the Gods build, pull up the grill
Check out the mad skills
Top secret technique, too hard for you to peep it and keep it
Jiggy style of rap and watching knuckle slang sweep it
Out of order tape recorder can't record my slaughter
Spoil the rotten Donna too good to be forgotten
High top notch, borderline rhymes is hand-cocked
Ninety-six, my ill sound clash is still hot
Get yourself shot


All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that shit that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring you Shaolin's finest
But if your skills are weak you better step behind us




That summer... the summer '88 is the best...
But that's your nostalgia though
"Just for the nostalgia," you gotta say
That's my most nostalgic moment of hip-hop music ever
Right


I'll just sit right here and sing that good, old-school shit to you
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own
Oh baby you know
All that lovemaking we did
Boy, it was so real, I wanna feel that again
Long lost friend from way back when
Eric B was president
Tell me where the melody went
And if you still care, say ''yeah, yeah, yeah''
Sing it like I used to do
This one is for me and you, oh


La-di-da-di-da-di-da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
And oh baby, you know
Make love
Thats how you do it
Just like you did it back then
This is dedicated to you


I'll just sit right here and sing that good old school shit to you
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own
Oh baby you know, that love making we did
Boy, It was so real, I wanna feel that again
Loyal friends from way back then
Tell me can you vision us
36 Chambers high
Feels like were there, yeah yeah yeah
Remix of a fantasy, I hear em singing back to me like...


La-di-da-di-da-di-da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
And oh baby you know. make love
Thats how you do it
Just like you did it back then
This is dedicated to you


Nah, we dont wish todays game was old again
We just wish it wasnt full of Draconian, Babylonian, phony men
FOH my summation fascinates, we have debates
Whos the greatest living or passed away
I ask MC, see what she has to say
Eric B or Master P, some see it differently
87 meant to me? I try to describe it, you try to relive it
I try to revive it hoping that you get it, yeah
Something about La Di Da Di got inside our bodies
Something about My Adidas coming out the speakers
Used to do the Wop or the Pee-Wee Herman
Rest in peace Heavy D, Moneyearnin Mount Vernon
Lets go


La-di-da-di-da-di-da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
And oh baby you know
Make love
Thats how you do it
Just like you did it back then
This is dedicated to you


Oh baby you know
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you



That nigga damn better get me in the tunnel tonight kid
I ain't playin , straight up


The mafia version , son chop me up , got a locked version
Rocked up , knocked on a person
Extraterrestrial , kill em now let's be out
Just out , flowin over water then jet ski out
Feel up the heat surgeon , ankle gun , diamond on my thumb
Rough version , enough shots come murkin
Pullin ?every slot ski? IV's ?pop go cop a yacht piece
Fish and grease status and some hot grease
Fur lookin lassin , assassin
Jet lash rap nod till you crash
Hot rod flash
Bury mines in the mountains
Sprayin an ounce and everybody out bouncin
Chill or pay , couch countin
White gold table , cable on , automatic murder bent sable
Paperwork , page you
Last word from the Russians
We flashin up dutches
Yellin cat flex to these raw Cream Team touched it

CHORUS:
I wonder if someday that somebody wants to say that
Dem want war
I wonder if someday that somebody wants to say that
Dem want war


Escaped in the six
Horror flicks , knowin how tomorrow gets
Niggas wanna borrow , take six
Cremate money , saw his hand floody , analyze he make money
Great minds and thugs play funny
Touchin a novelist's hands I gave you power
Nigga make grands , flowin like a lake in Iceland
Checkin my team , lookin tropical
Rocked up watches spottable
It symbolizes I ain't gotta do
Share this money or die
Fear a nigga if he look shy
2000 eye , holdin fly
The speaker collapsed
Can't wait till they bring the Gucci sneakers back
Nigga like this , I buy a rack
The man like Floyd Mayweather
Y'all , the opposite lookin gay togehther
Trade in them plain leathers
It's like this make a classic
Me , I wrap it up , shit plastic
I'm married to the cash dick

CHORUS




Yeah, Shaolin
Shaolin and the French Connexion
Ol' Kainry, the legend Ol' Kainry
And the French Connexion


En bas dun bloc a tiser lalcool
S'plaignant d'un vcu misrable, refuse de grandir comme Michael
L o des mecs plombent, dautres mecs tombent
Jaurais pu peut-tre tomber mais les pecs bombs
Jtiens le cromi avec Raekwon, come on
Idoltrez un mec comme Tony Montana
Ce fils de lche sniffait la coke et ngligeait sa nana
Jen connais plein qui en ont dans le crne, de la came non
Se sont faits sduire par les charmes du bton
Auraient pu gagner mais se sont fait caner par la street man


Eh Yo, I grew up on the crime side, New-York times side
Now, Im in France in 91 C town
Canal project with the Hill thugs
Word up its real love when youre dealin with drugs
Make money, thats the model, carry big hamous
Blow your face off the stun, this is all camera
Grew up wild the 4-5 child about to get thous
Me and Ol' Kainry explain


Eh yo de Park Hill  91 Pise les scarlas scheckent
Ice water Inc. Ol' Kainry, Raekwon the Chef
From Park Hill to 91 peace, gangstas link up
Ice water Inc. Ol' Kainry, we all thinkers


Drugs get served when its nightime, bodies getting found
So many young niggas get in last time
Dont know nothing but the school hip hop
Thats free ship, in other worlds so kit out, kick up
We live in the hood, the medicine is real dangerous
We sell it through and re-ups and rock rangers
You kill for me, I kill for you
This is real choc, Raekwon is spin-off with you


Yo, cest la street niggas, cest plus quune histoire de fric
Jveux voir mes types qui marchent en quipe pour honorer lAfrique, niggas
Que des classiques, tas vu
Jai voulu graille, jai quitt le bahut bien trop tt et le quartier ma eu
Eh yo, jprendrais ma part, pas par hasard comme a la roulette
Jvais tout mettre, jveux des sous mec, baiser des poulettes
Jai fait de la manut', plein dcartons dans des brouettes
Eh si tu veux me voler ma part, jte mets une boulette




Mon mic est un flingue, pour mon hood un bad clin dil
Du genre, je tenvoie une patate du Canal et t'atteris en Inde

My shit will let off life success
From 91 to Park Hill holdin my steel we rep a new set

Des gars auraient pu sen sortir mais galrent ivres
Oublier les erreurs du pass amnent  les revivre

Yeah, the game is deadly, learn from me dont be a victim
Call your fight, you better swerved yeah

Plus facile de sortir le gun que s'battre
Plus facile de mal parler alors les imposteurs jactent
Plus facile de mentir alors les imposteurs brassent
Plus facile de matraquer alors les inspecteurs bavent eh yo

Chef and Ol' Kainry (avoue que le quartier tas eu)
Chef and Ol' Kainry
Chef and Ol' Kainry (avoue que le quartier tas eu)
Chef and Ol' Kainry



Chef and Ol' Kainry, Chef and Ol' Kainry
Chef and Ol' Kainry, Chef and Ol' Kainry
The Legend Ol' Kainry, word up
The Legend Ol' Kainry




At the holy city of Mecca, Grey Flannel cologne
Crazy ammo get blown, wherever I sit, son
That is my throne (Raekwon: you know how we do it)


Aiyo, POP POP POP went the shots, who's to blame?
Three get dropped and removed from the game
One get knocked, now his whole life is changed
Cuz he's so far from free in a world that seem strange


I come from a place where they say, death comes too soon
Where the hoods on the block, dance to a different tune
Every night and every day, hotels of foul play
Turns fatal, when this hostile land of AK's
On any date, not wait to pump them rounds
The reminder; it's a murderer stomping ground
With one less witness, gunned down in the staircase
Who had led his crew, but he was moving at a snail's pace
Many suspects, many possible motives
Just kept coming with unstoppable explosives
The weak fold in these most extreme conditions
While the rivals quickly strengthen their position
The mission was to move in, with sheer brute force
And lives, they get lost, on a collision course
The streets are fascinating, so they gotta explore it more
But not without walking through some hurricane corridors
Become the most wanted, life can seem haunted
Thugs and agents who work closely up on it
Patriotic hustlers that kill for presidents
Conceal the truth, but can't hide the evidence
A man died holding some dice that he was shaking
Like a bank stop, but no valuables was taken
Shot at 8:45, but he died at 9
A video was the most precise witness to the crime




The story had a familiar ring of truth
But it needed, a little more tangible proof
He was blown off the map, behind the aggravated kidnaps
Shrap' metal everywhere, the bomb was gift wrapped
The problem had became increasingly urgent
Since the product was nothing but bags of detergent
In all the years of war, this was the most
Vicious battle and mainly fought from up close
A bundle burglary, with no surprise
Just another sloppy murder that was in disguise
Now they can do nothing but hope and pray
That the boys don't come through with the scope and spray
Valuable time comes with a price to pay
Smoke on a deserted street, just a mile away
Tusslin' with those cannibals, right from the start
That'll rip out your heart, and consume the fattest part
Better watch from the eye of federal agents
Selecting cams, while they was disguised as vagrants
Not knowing that a prisoner had held the key
Of a co-defendant, he was so far from free
Detectives search into a distant past
Of a young gun who made the block grow fast
Narrow ducks who were cooked and came home to roast
The suspects would seek refuge off the coast




Word up, holding it down
Holding the fort, nigga, youknowhatisayin?
All we need is a bunch of red coats coming through
Stayin' official on some gangster shit
Bloodhounds, thirsty, lurking in the bushes
Yeah... (1. b4 Nf6 2. c4)




POP POP POP, when it shots, whose to blame?
Three get dropped and removed from the game
One get knocked, now his whole life is changed
Cuz he's so far from freeing the world, that seem strange


I come from a place where they say, death comes too soon
Where the hoods on the block, dance to a different tune
Every night and every day, hotels of foul play
Turns fatal, when this hostile land of AK's
On any date, not wait to pump them rounds
The reminder; it's a murderer stomping ground
With one less witness, gunned down in the staircase
Who had led his crew, but he was moving at a snail's pace
Many suspects, many possible motives
Just kept coming with unstoppable explosives
The weak fold in these most extreme conditions
While the rivals quickly strengthen their position
The mission was to move in, with sheer brute force
And lives, they get lost, on a collision course
The streets are fascinating, so they gotta explore it more
But not without walking through some hurricane corridors
Become the most wanted, life can seem haunted
Thugs and agents who work closely up on it
Patriotic hustlers that kill for presidents
Conceal the truth, but can't hide the evidence
A man died holding some dice that he was shaking
Like a bank stop, but no valuables was taken
Shot at 8:45, but he died at 9
A video was the most precise witness to the crime, it's on




Uh, crips and bloods, bricks and thugs
Clips and thugs, that's gangsta
Lifes, more disciples, send me assault riffles
Bust if he don't like you, that's gangsta
O-3-1's, and, Latin Kings with
Dirty guns, that's gangsta
Shot dozen coppers, Mexican mafias
Killing innocent, and son they dons


Yo, a view to a killing, aim two to the ceiling
When niggas started illin', random chick catch a stray
Now her whole nose is peeling, and some girls is squeeling
So the po-po's concealing the exits
The four-four's grilling at the next shit
Homey's wetless, when they tech spit
Death is something, that's the best shit
Niggas play XBox 360, wet shit
Halo 2 and SoCom, fresh paws hit the block
There go Saddam, muthafuckas know your moms
But get frustrated and blow your bombs
Little niggas is too small to hold they arms
Drex' should of thought about that, before get gone
Sixteen years old getting charged as adult
Conservatives, want harsher sentences but get no result
And I still can't read a burner, maybe I'm part of the problem
But when the war's going on outside, you know the outcome






I really don't need to be *fuckin* wit ya right now
I need to movin' around in the air, circlin' Manhattan
Real smooth


Here we go again son, black Harrison *Ford* on the run
One, beef in the field, it's real
Highly recommend shield, Lee rocks, still he rock
Got the blue lazer, grill, like Martin *Scorcese*-ah
Jumpin outta limo's, *expos*, black rentals
Chasin *niggas* through the projects, polex

Tailin' us in boats and land, *40 caliber* in my hand
Made the left... Lex fam
Sho enough what, *Hummer* craft lookin up, what?
Kid the chipped out *flex* now I'm stuck
Bounced on him, public announcements say they want him
Any ideas? Where he at? Cops want him
Changin' the gear the same foot wear
Runnin like a crook, yea, no love here
*Fuck* yea, we up there
Had a little *drugs* there, they was there
Pass it kid, *Novacain* caught a slug there
Had it mastered in fleis-school, *nigga* go whip a plane
Drivin land, map *shit* out, go to night school
Bronze star, feelin who we are
Half animal, whole lotta love, black God
Standin' front and center, from here to winter
Grip the *splinter, shoot it sideways, nozzle on, pop-it*
(nothin' but determination)
Ready to hit somethin, pop *shit* wit somethin
Blow *blimps* on the mad rubber grips, big lips on it
Rollin wit top rank medals, hands is like *Greg Neddles*
Bright link, purple heart, swim bezzle
Hearin' the horn of Josh, movin' like the moss
Executive decision play large
Caught a blip on the radar, screen him out
Fightin' like like Julio *Cazar*, blaze y'all
May day, may day, chasin' me, CIA, KGB, FBI, DIA on they way
Trynna chase down the God, this Afro-African'll lace ya


Nothin' but determination


Part two kid, establish brain power, truth did
Yo it's realer than a *fuck* now, ain't stupid
Trash, three hundred thousand in cash, guerilla mash
Brass this gat, TNT *niggas* on my *ass*

Clear my own *shit*, let the press ill, let's bill
Make it to the UN, doin bout a thousand in the blue M
Frogmen, repped out cluein, *left all the American Express cards*
Left the passports, time share, *shit up on* in *Escort*
Bail 'em, bustin his *joint*, Chief O'Heara
That old, *Louis McDarren*, see the waves through the mirror
Spot that, hop that, through the top back
Ready to lock somethin', down for the cause, stop that
You play the king, I play the *pawn*, who the king of the Swarm?
You wrong, where's the evidence, watch the *fire* arm
Wit eternal affairs there, I knew I had little bits of love
Hopin it'll be fair, he watch me, heavy roxy scene
He clean though, American *Cream* Team let him leave
See the moral of the story, feelin' me like
Mordon and Glory when they came for me
Had fifty on the line, look at mine, all dressed down
Handlin' nines, know the time




The way that momma raised us was pure faith
So diablo wouldn't faze us or daze us
Or lay us down to sleep
Know the wolf from the sheep
Or the sheep who cried wolf
And threw the deadly hoof
While the wolf was asleep
I keep my mind a ghost
Follow my heart the most
Don't play fools too close
Sleep with my eyes at post
So Diablo won't be hostin the game of life
The knife sits by throats of the young
And blows death straight through the lungs
As the mind gets washed by visions of sugar plums
But we shall overcome cause we ain't dumb
But we ain't smart, they got the girls by the hearts
And the niggas by the nuts
Ear, tongue and butts
Yeah, they're trying to fuck us up
But, shit, you know what's up
We gotta get with the movement
And move men soon
They consume every womb who bares
Beneath the stairs of their doom
Best believe they're gonna shove em in a tomb

Chorus: repeat 4X

Cause everytime I step to the microphone
I put my soul on 2 inch reels
That I don't even own


Early Saturday mornin I was cartoon gazin
Slowly broke into the kitchen
To fill a bowl with some Raisin Bran
As I ran up and down the TV stations
I witnessed Indian Joe
Getting tricked out of this nation
By a silly hillbilly
Who laughed as the shit happened
Everything's the same
The game continued into rappin
Deception is at an all-time high
You give a piece of your soul
To receive some crumbs from the pie
But you know I keep on rappin til the break of dawn
Even though it is my soul that I do not even own

Chorus: repeat 4X


I was po', black and broke
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
Ass-out, wide open waitin for my shit to come on out
Speakin about the time before I got signed
I was coolin behind Coolio in the County Line
My big brother used to say I was an asshole
Didn't graduate, couldn't handle the hassle
Of high school, why fool
Wit' foolish rules and guidelines
Fuck the cap and tassels
Said forget the trade and tried rhymes
Hooked up with J-Swift, got with 2-4-2
Me and my nigga L.A. Jay back at S.C.U
I grab the MIC one-time
Check it, 1-2, we in
Freakin' major flavors with my fellow Nubians
Takin shit to the next level
Too bad I sold my soul to the fuckin devil




So yo yo all I want to do is just tell them cats
On the real, keep your game high man, keep it up
Word up, never stop your goals man, yaknowhatI'msayin?
(For real baby)
And, yo son, on the real I'ma get a sneaker just like y'all


I need help (Because the black man is God)
The government is after me (And the worst is, black man is the Devil)
I need help (So this is to bring everything in the)
Someone help me please (universe within the light)
Someone help me! (Understanding)
They already did 2Pac (My children, all six billion humans)
Biggie Smalls (on the planet Earth)
Someone help me! (Regardless of who or what, I love you)
Someone help me please! (Word is bond, I love you)

Ahh! I'mma groupie for life, about nine wife
All the babies are mine, save a child life
No more doctors deliverin my babies
Stick in pins killing me slowly
To the President you say I'm a welfare fraud
You motherfucking right! Let's burn this dark house white!
Insecure about my ding-dong, married to Babylon
My queen lookin at me like a pawn!


Splash the worst rehearse a verse Flashdance on the universe
Televise the work Network Shop till your neck hurt
What up Dirt? Nine diagram phoenix on your sweatshirt
Thirty-thousand went berserk, it's like clockwork
Rockport Mr. Raw God, hold the fort
Collect thoughts, elect sports, sideswipe, by the white horse
French cut, gleaming in the Benz truck, what up?
Telling my mens what? Ten times platinum and we ends up
Draped out, jumpin out a cake, now throw your tape out
Furniture style, holdin the mic we got it laid out
Mind iodine Einstein remind mine
People swam nine didn't know they own kind wrong time
Denim rap, competition quick, handle that
Sucking the jim hat, perverting on my raps'll get you slidapped
Mix drink Cuban Link lizink, flip a to zinc
Plus, expensive like a Roman mink, now think


An ugly thirty-six chamber degree, what, you wanna rhyme?
Deep bring 600 ABC through the love white hate line
I'm telling you tornado, 42 billion thought travel
The year 90's parallel, controls to the wakes
I dick womb and stomach swell, my borough is dark
Many lights UFO kites, Benjamin Franklin got it right
Abraham I stuck your cherry tree
Your white head came out my black pussy
I ran Rip Van Winkle on all fours
Mountains twinkle twinkle star, Tarzan in a jar
And then came out Jane Flintstone in my gravel pit


Kill the chatterin, niggas bust shots, keep em scatterin
Blood splatterin, on point like a javelin
Fuck battlin, you cats is only good for babblin
Imaginin yourself, as the God space travellin
Round the seven rings of Saturn
Got my sword plus the Abbot in the chamber, nine in the clip
At the gatherin, we left you staggerin, yo it had to been
Hot Nickel, who broke bread, at the Vatican
Stick a pin, in a citizen, mental food, got us diggin in
My compliments to the chef
M-E-TH like amphatimens, yes stick it to the veteran
Blaow blaow! Blown to death, take your medicines
I put the sick in your mu-sick with Osirus
Bound to blow like a bad sinus


Stay up at night don't sleep on your morn
Rest in the day because it's sunlight
Reverse thought psychology


Child wild adventures walk trillions of square inches
Ten percentage try to drain me of my mental strengthage
Heavy wattage knowledge cleans blood clottage, and retardage
I refine the garbage logic exterminate your cottage


Thirty-six anger, dirty language is the stranger
The mangler, the honor roll singer righteous finger
When we shine-a, we always find a never minor major
Hard to spot we dangerous with our behavior


Australian Venezuelan illegal aliens
Chameleons all catch the feelings we revealing
Killer bee keep your mind at ease, lay back like Adam fuckin Eve
Four thousand years in the garden, puffin trees


I aim slang I maintain, through the main vein
The answer came clever, when we do greatness through trial and error
Mile of terror motor mouth, let the odour out
Fuming greater, the temper in my spine huminator
The super grass childish blast sleepy eye stash
The hashish masterpiece, Osirus is the virus
This split second splash, severe drop is near pop
There's falling teardrops, now is it worth your career?




So when it's over, we demanding our weapons
Stop, cock, shoot, now I'm in the ghost of perfections
Smooth Willie chilling with his Spartans
Fart in front of your bitch, squeeze her tits, move aside, pardon
Paid niggas don't talk, just straight to the bar
Buy the whole shit out, then light up a bark
Colorful kings, wardrobes is different from yours
You don't want no beef, better take it to Moe's
Put the drink on the side and say what
My mans with the turban on, mouth froze
Y'all niggas is fucked
He was my son out of Gun Hill, I know him through Tec
If it's the last thing we do, we gon get at his neck
Bartender, give me the check
Keep him right here, I'll be back
Now everybody knowing I'm connected
Hopped in a 7, left 57 of my wolves
This is personal, niggas don't fret
Ay yo


One more man gon die tonight
One more hand gon ride tonight
If it's a m on the table, I'm down
Yo, don't be yapping off at the mouth
When niggas don't see dude around


We in Kentucky Fried, lucky guy
Him and his kid
From the first, bite a bullet woulda flew through his wig
Be smooth, chill, wait for the kids
Older nigga not that stupid to see the gun on his rib
Fuck it, catch him by the crib
Yo, he live with his wiz
She the bow-legged stripper bitch we fingered in Liv
For a buck, she would guzzle your kids
And let you kick a tall-boy Heineken up in the shit
This wack-ass nigga fronting, yap about bids
Behind the walls, niggas pissed on him, gave him the biz
Just a tough guy fronting cause he famous and shit
Back in '89, baby crimes, rape and some shit
We should have killed him then
He dusted, look at his bib
I should have milked him right there and then
Fuck it, son, yo, guzzle the gin
Let's make the movie occur
To blow up in a Spur, yelling win





Drug dealer's dream
Cruel bottles, vinyls on move
Amphetamines, a beretta and a pool
With a whale of kings
All guns is bodied, lobby in the hall




There's only one stud who could rip off New York
Ruin Rome
And stay alive
To run a number in Africa
That superfly dude is back
Black
And beautiful
He's twice as cool
Twice as sly
Twice as deadly



(Raekwon)
This veteran's charge, soon to have a Wally garage
Yea, demand the land, I want a jet black discovery recovery, big time
See when you, when you start fucking wit my shit like that
You're taking on a natural high see what I'm saying
Shit is natural (yea no doubt) shit is like baking a cake

Know what I'm saying, Doe or Die style kid, the remix

Yo, yo I roll wit brothers who puff dust lust plus

Yo now let me show you how my whole team operate
Cooperate, tie you up, drop you on the Tri-state

The veteran's charge, bagging all these shorties up in sport cars

Czechoslovakia, Khadafi, dunn, diamonds
What, Sosa, La costra nostra
Snap a flick of this Chef, double exposure

(AZ)
Who's the wickedest, street official-est, Guess, Cortex

So let's lay law cause only fat cats play ball
Let this ape walk, cause taking his paper's all I crave for
The resurrection 86 cartel connection
Raid your section, L's twist to a perfection

(Raekwon)
Primetime, genuine, shine, Lex seat recline
Yo, 'Vine, he ran up on me with a nine, he's mine
I won't play, Gamma ray spray Rae, he tried to pray
He threw a grand away, yo, I plan a day to drive his land away
Doe or die, right, light up the Thai, my peoples get high
Showing my love to niggas on the inside

(AZ)
Black supreme, high king, mine shine like high beams
Who be that dime queen? Seems she take time in her hygiene
My lime green, Italian gator boots made a fiend
Check the Firm team, names internationally ring
Triple X large, duplex with a garage
Gold Express Cards plus enough 'sess to bless the Gods
So let's play, catch me in a Motown Cafe
Cap on half way, sipping OJ and Grand Marnier
Doe or die way, Courvoisier




Just keep away (just keep away
Go on, it's not your fight!)
It's not yours nigga, fall back
I'm about to blow something out here
Straight up, yeah, this is a family thing
We gon' handle our business and shit
These muthafuckas know not to come around here like that
This is real shit, real talk
Four different niggas, with four different aspects, nigga
This is family shit
Who the fuck said family ain't family no more, nigga?
This is tight shit, tighter than white in ya wallet


Yo, I'm talking bags of heavy coke, bracelets on every men
Innocent dope pushers, over night king pins
Indeed, we smack niggas up for their cheese
Throw bleach in yo face, got beef, let it be chuck
The streets don't know my peeps
Jumpin' out of UPS trucks, blowing niggas off they feet
With four-four gloves, rims spinning, tippin' on fo-fo's
My mouth be worth millions, something like Paul Wall's
Ladies look out; they ain't thugs, they homo's
The film look hyper, when I clap 'em in slo mo'
Ya'll still paying the mob? We whip niggas out like waffle batter
Theodore ancient with dart, flossin' them diamonds
Discussing our hits over a glass of scotch
Baywatch bitches that ski, take turns when they hand us the twat
Think not, we still run the trains, til the condom pop
On the low, we still fucking them cops
Pretty things from all precints, friday nights, we holding they Glocks
This is family, nigga, niggas can't stand me
Next up, my little man, I hand you the jammy


You know the fam, what it is, it is what it is
S.I.N.Y., where the animals live
Ass bet, niggas run in yo cribs
I don't care if you blast for the cash, then scramble yo wig
I'm like "Damn, what a wonderful kid"
I could do what I want, doing dirt, not serving a bid
You know a real fam handle they biz, everybody get searched
From the grandpops, down to the kids
And my time, I'm officially here, tell ya man
Go and start up ya car, start shifting the gears
Sun God got the pits for his ears, cuz niggas is scared
Hoping I don't let it blow in they ribs
I said hot, niggas get robbed non stop
Once the gun cock, niggas strip down to they socks
And my fam at the tippity top, I won't stop
Believe it or not, you and ya man is close targets
Juks everything, dice games, mini markets
Fam gon' spark it, I'mma take whatever's in the pockets
Mostly the cash and the wallet, slide off the jewels
Cuz you shining, begets and the diamonds
Never deny niggas with iron... YO!


Aiyo, chillin' with the Ceasar crew
We can smoke, all in the halls
It's how many niggas with guns, got 'em on
All tip top, cling to the fullest, mad bullets
This is a hobby, the lobby where they clap yo hoods
Get the paper, word to everything, we a acre up
Barbequin' like a mutt, we ain't taking nothing
A high tech extremist, Gatorade, paid ya boy some money
To lay up on the low, swinging beamers
I need to be an actor, but instead, I'd rather be in Hempstead
All of my bread came from crack barbers and shoppers
So much beef in these whoppers
Guns that'll knock out floors and hit choppers
What? What? The family remains, cuz it's grain
It's automatic, I live it and I claim it
It's real, come around here, you bought here
Yo, lay that half tape, then you will get wrapped real quick


Aiyo, we hug the block on President's Day
Swinging all year round, gettin' that money the American way
Might run up in yo wedding, grab the reverand and spray
And let the shots for whatever they may
This is family, nigga, minus the mob size
The resurrection of Toney Starks & Trife Dies', starring in Part 5
Niggas'll rather die when they're pride's in question
Try'nna play hero, getting stuck for they prized possessions
Look you staring in the eyes of oppression, that's why I ride with protection
Extended clips, super sizing my weapons
Five eleven, keep the heat tucked
That'll burn a hole thru ya stomach like acid reflux
Get buried in ya cheap tux'
We make it hard for you niggas to keep up
Been thru a hundred towns, and running, beating the streets up
Come up north in New York, down in Miami, pumping
At a table, breaking bread like a family


Florida, where we follow the code of the streets and
Breaking the beats and, we taking the eats
Never the least, we invading the streets
Shaking the beast, we familiar for life
We don't run, we grab knives, my double edged spit life
My dogs is real tight, shooting the dice
Some of my fam might snatch ya ice
Got family that go to church, come back like you don't work
Got family that'll set you up, got family that chill, wanna spark the dutch
Wizard my fam, that stuck you up, I got fam that'll fuck you up
Chop you up, put your body in the back of the truck
Osama Island, we been wilding, see the violence
We display talent, respect balance, nigga, Shaolin




Yo, hahahaha, who that, who that
Who that, who that, who that
Flipmode, Icewater, yeah, Flipmode come on
Icewater, let's get it, come on, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


I come with a grind and put it down, picture perfect, rep for the whole team
Get it in, like a needle, in an arm of a dope fiend
And again, dip fresher than a tux' from Armani, nigga
Eating that Cipriani, spending money like Gotti
Pull out my cold watch, Swiss edition, Rio collection, I'm out
Let me put you on to what you don't know about
Like the Bombardier Challenger 300 private plane
Shades Cartier, guarded they suit, and they like my name
Busta Bus, see how they love it and know it
Not only the type to show it, I'm nice as a poet
Every now and then I might give you a chance and you blow it and pounce
And fight in the dance, get it popping while choking them out
Smoking them out (poking them out) see I ain't playing
I'm focused, (like mercenaries), I'm ready to ounce, I'm laying
Out for this money, I'll rake in the stakes, while they pulling the port
(Pay me) money I ain't taking no shorts


It's like back in the days, when niggas used to hustle for this skrilla
Formulate a plan, don't even plot, just get a nigga
But see, we knew a crew of dudes, who hustled a lot, we broke
The opportunities and set up drug deals in the parking lot
Stacking cuz it's necessary, notice how the world go round
See it's imperative, we get richer than rich
You see we hustling across the border (Icewater)
Hurting the town, this money probably got me mistreating your bitch (Do it big)


Aiyo, Busta Bus, what's good, (shit shit) what's popping, homey?
Niggas think they hot, but they not, need to stop it, homey
Listen man, don't make me put my hand inside my pocket, homey
(Oh you got that thang thang) Aiyo, shit, I got a rocket, homey
Slip up, and it's gon' tear a bone up out the socket, homey
(I don't think they want that) Come on, stay with logic, homey
Ice Dot and Flipmode, (It sounds like a problem, homey)
Yo, I whoop ass (kick ass, like a game of soccer, homey)
Yo, Miz, they done fucked up (somebody call a doctor, homey)
Bust, yo, good looking, homey (music got them hookers on me)
Ice Dot, straight hood, your boy spit that crack, homey
(DJ, what's good) come on, bring it back, homey




Let me find out you coming to harm me
And I'mma hit my nigga Bus up, catch you under that palm tree
And the weed be the color of Barney, the size C.E
You got beef, better come with your army
And Chef pull the cars up, and I ain't talking bout no coffee, nigga
When I tell you that I'm getting Starbucks
You can get your squad touched, it's the Water and Flipmode
With a shitload of that hard stuff


I'm like a 2009 Jordan, known to be sporting
New waves, new uniform on, important
Political prisoner, charisma, got me sniffing money
Regardless, jumping out the V dog with RZA
Hypothetically my joint athletically better be
We safe and in question, nigga, you said it be
Fully charged, new one-on-one in the garage
Large, niggas they chill and bitches they dodge
What's the deal, little homey, it's only real, got tech and ill
I only carry steel out when I'm lonely
Bloodhounds who play the building, buildin', brick at a time
Trying to turn my little dime into a million


It's like back in the days, when niggas used to hustle for this skrilla
Formulate a plan, don't even plot, just get a nigga
But see, we knew a crew of dudes, who hustled a lot, we broke
The opportunities and set up drug deals in the parking lot
Stacking cuz it's necessary, notice how the world go round
See it's imperative, we get richer than rich
You see we hustling across the border (Icewater)
Hurting the town, this money probably got me mistreating your bitch (Do it big)




Yeah, Wu-Block, aiyo, Ghost, aiyo, Chef
Clip up, nigga!


I drop fifty on the order, more hundred on the whip
Five on the Louis luggage, ten on the trip
Sour when I land a little, something for the hip
Fiji or Roset, and I don't even take a sip
Nah, they don't do it like we do
Nah, they don't do it like us
Nah, they don't do it like we do
Nah, they don't do it like us


Yeah, Donnie laughing at you sore losers
Underdogs hot, 2011 Hoosiers
That's cruisers that's jumped off from back flipping pussies
Splash, I get all them clothes smelling cushy
Shades on, Aviator lens
Mami sitting in my Benz, like she Liz Claiborne
That you already rolled, now it's hella flame, on
Little model bitch, had to get game, on
Yeah, the hood say I'm on fire
Donnie on the street like a Good Year, tire
Still look the same and that's last years, flyer
Just more money, but way more, higher




Aiyo, Benz and grams being torn from the rubber bands
Latifah shorts, tennis courts in the summer mans'
Skydiving in Fiji Islands with a sweet view
Balley parachutes, the water is deep blue
Micro felt goggles, Brazil models, keep a mouth full
While I'm hitting they back tonsils
Me and Sheek is Selleck and George Clooney
A Russian chef with scars on his chest, the boats mad roomy
Only niggas that move good pots to the rasta
Switzerland, we flying in vet to examine the watches
And we ain't gotta throw ice on 'em, we count one for Kiss
Styles, Rae and Cap, L and Mike and 'em




Aiyo, two hundred thousand in dust paper
Let a bullet thrust, take your Jacob, I'm always in make-up
Under your trucks, Scottish ruger, jump suiter
Rad little slut, one white killa with bucks on
Wearing jewelry, robbing jewelry, peep out the coats
I switch pockets then pull out the scope
Niggas is dice, ya'll famous for the legendary clarks
Lamping in Junior's, eating squid, me and Starks
Chatting quiet, no talking, just finger jabbing
Sheepskins grey, beneath the feet, crisp balley
D&C Kangols, white Russian gazelles
Keep a track on the sickest bat like Modell's






Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop


Cash rules everything around me, I'm fresh out the slum
Rich bum nigga, now I live dumb
Talking 'bout that cream
Leaning in the Tower of Pisa
Seven visas, got condos in the jungle
The mind stay rich but the pockets is well-filled
Let's violate this lil' area, get milk
I'm telling you, man, you don't want no part of this, fam
Get punched in the water like clams
KKK, slices, they one of the nicest
Stainless steel, sharp swords, dipped in ricin
Everybody eating, everybody full
Just a young bull lighting a Phillie, still a willy
Ball on 'em, in the Bentley with the wall on 'em
Yo, I'll sleep when I'm dead, like the hood, homies
Who get it cracking in the park, homes?
Park Hill narco, smoke and let the bones turn to charcoal
Let's get richer, kid
Signature Louis Rich, won't stop until there's billions in this bitch


Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop


I grew up on the rhyme side, that "gotta get mine" side
That white girl, we mix it with quinine
You players try and ball from the sidelines
While I'm aging like fine wine, you internet thuggin' somebody timeline
Between love and hate is a fine line
And these habitual line steppers can die trying
A New York Islander, my clique's NY Giants
A pocket full of NY (K)nicks for my clients
Y'all ain't buying, stop crying and stop lying
Hakuna Matata, no Mufasa, I'm not lion
You try to spit on that hot iron, you not iron
The irony 'cause that last shot just shot by him
So let's start it with this, son, motivate him with this one
If you ain't got no haters, go get some
Is anybody greater? There is none
Assorted 'Now And Laters', my clan got too many flavors to pick from


Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop


Deuce high when I start my game
It's like, you should see it live dog, all you see is sparks and flames
I grab bags and I park my ways, the way I have 'em all locked
You would think they gave they heart to bae
Bet on us, baby, ain't no better odds to play
It's hard to fake, my real life is on display
Either love or hate whatever part you play
I take the best of both worlds like R. and Jay
Own boss, no third party
Produce more murder than Irv Gotti
Like I'm working on my third body
Deck, kill it quick
24/7 bed rest, that's how ill it get
Can't stop if I mash the brakes
Got the cash it takes, I might flash my face
Half an eighth got me floating like I'm trapped in space
Not safe for your workplace, a basket case


Don't stop, never stop
Can't stop getting this guap
Fat money knot, hammer cock, curry hot
Cook a fool, hit the block
No shorts, bring it back
Flipping this, stack that
Free it up, weigh it up
Don't stop, never stop
Can't stop getting this guap
Fat money knot, hammer cock, curry hot
Cook a fool, hit the block
No shorts, bring it back
Flipping this, stack that
Free it up, weigh it up
Quest for success with my mind on my money
Came a new rhyme saying "Wu-Tang is the best"
Music
Yeah, peace to Khaled

Dialogue

[Outro: RZA}
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop




"Thats it. Joey Zasa. He can't be doing this alone. Ugh, just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"


The smell of speed is in the air
When known for smoking path
A bunch of different people, one building
Tonight we culture clash
I ain't supposed to be here, my nigga
Them lives be over fast
Young'ns disappear, then be bigger
Looks like he chose the AVE
Look how I treat my inferiors, not my equals
Gold skin chronic interior, peep my prequel
Don't let that glitter deceive you
She'll get one up, you'll bleed too
Very seldom you'll squeeze through
Check my propellers from diesel
Every weekend I be lit up
Tailored for fly drops
Up and down one of the side blocks
She licks the eye of cyclops
Party not, Givenchy star, my high tops
My chain hit and bring her pretty ass home
That Loubie RBI pops
Play them games around here, be in that sky box
Ain't no freedom of crime props
Bestin me just Rewind. Stop
Shout out to lye shops
Every one of them on my time slot
Shocks to those who think I can't do it
I'm thinking "Why not?"


Nobody said it would be easy, baby, you believe me?
No battles will take the fun out at all, never defeat me
Drop a diamond for the coolest nigga
I'm back to shining with my movie nigga
Know they've been waiting, time to deliver
Where the real motherfuckers at?
Too many faking now, what's up with that?
I'd rather get to it, one up to Mac
I tipped a mountain, there ain't no coming back
A thousand dimes, I fell in love with racks


What up, son? Umbrella handguns
45 hammers coming, all of these Samantha on par
Keep shedding campus running
Newscaster cameras come
Nickel plated cannon gun
Bystanders chased by the highlanders, I plan to rumble
War rich thugs, a few rich cubs
Hide money inside the screw twist tubs
And, yo, smoke weed, bring monster trees
Petrified niggas who testified
Get blown down, electrified
Hard niggas used to starve a nigga
Rob the rob niggas, now we flex the cars
Eating [?}, my nigga
Build minx style, wild I berry and lynx style
Dressed a drawer full of shells, I think childish
What you want to do? My money be up too
And we be up all week laying to interrupt you
Sprinter trucks, roll up
What's up killer, fuck you!
Red carpet, you're out
Blaow, look up, BOOM!




One wrong makes me angry, two wrongs makes it even
One of the greatest MCing
Homie, the date i should be in
Homie, I take out the legion
Stone me and call me
Holy mattress from the hoes I'm holding
Hollering season
Man, I do it cause its therapeutic
Better I use it, tough as leather music
Straight since the teacher who severed students
Off the head with Judas
I had to make it, I'm from South Jamaica
Put here to drop everybody, me and my taser
Hit the city, she's going to drop through the party, 3 AM favors
These days they gave us well spent, champagne bent
I need a famous wall to paint my tape on
You ripped the seal of napalm
And it's raining, hate storm
Triggers reveal an A-bomb
Jeweler ice me the fuck up
Freeze out my demons
Lightening 'Rarri speaking
Holy bars reroute the Heathens
One is for the money, two is for the money
Two doors too late to lose me with time
They looking for me...






The drops is out, the broads come out, roll the dice hear let the cops come out
Pinky ring hanging out the window like "you so crazy", bitch i'm a walking photo film me baby. 

Don't compare me to these niggas, I ain't them
Since I learned at history I don't do temps
Dedicate a song to a bitch who tripped my ends

Never that I ride an mc I ain't got a benz
22's on shit look clean
It's the aura not the money give me in them cheese
For being thug at 25 I was wanted 15
38  robbing for green
School day straight weed selling at his 16
17 12 hundred on the neck just clean
18 graduated started selling Ecstasy
Had my own crib in the birds, fuck is you telling me
When you get money, then you fall off
Remember that shit that ain't bitch
I'm just standing there, I'm still act nigga, aha, yeah

Pain in my life I gotta put it in flows
If I didn't I'd go crazy, drive myself off the road
I never crossed a nigga by not paying the toll
It's a price called life get closer to Christ
Yo all understand when I'm saying you definitely feel it
Can't see it with your eyes cause  is hysteric
I admit it never thought he 
Lot of bullshit today but it's joy tomorrow
Used to try to pass it by myself with
Think too much  but they ain't changed much
My  and gave up, no cheese trying to serve me
To get green, oh shucks
Remember me so wouldn't call the 

Saying Jr got guns and drugs in our home
I was  company she told on me  call
But that thing changed now's important

When you get money, then you fall off
Remember that shit that ain't  bitch
I'm just standing there, I'm still act nigga, aha, yeah

Yo, their  is for 91 the ratio
Still stare the devil in the space told him take that
Heavy bullshit upon my mind but I gotta live alone

If I wanna touch the gold must defeat that
Used to  which I'm Mario, and that's that
Told him I was chasin rap then the guy's stagnant
But I ain't enough said, all whole grudges to the finger, to the judges
I ain't moving or budging, I keep it real no fronting
Girl hit my phone wanna know what I'm on I tell her nothing
Damn I bug it, this is state of emergency so hit the rear button
Love kids leave your wife  like Lloyd Banks said
Plan escape with bars to get the 
I'm the head not the tail, ahead of these snails
I put my story on the beat tales

When you get money, then you fall off
Remember that shit that ain't  bitch
I'm just standing there, I'm still act nigga, aha, yeah



"Do that dance, grown up" - sample repeated throughout the song


Turn my microphone up a little high..
Yeah.. yeah, yeah, look, party people gath-
Party people gather round
(Do that dance, grown up, do that grown up, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yo, yeah, yeah
Do that dance, grown up, do that dance, grown up
Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo, aiyo)


Party people gather round, watch the God get down
The sound's so rugged, measure the erection
It's raw when I'm sexin' your brain
Cherry cream gleem leather seats, lean
Goose in the canteen, dutch leaf green
Blocklet of chocolates, ship a mil', box it
Moms and pops it, plan to be seventy five, live and kicking
Jewels drip in the heat --


Radioactive, roll that accurate, what?
Roll that backward, flow went back
I stand as a man, the game plan repped your name
The greatest Fam, with grain of sand
Me and Irief, Killin gangsta thieves
Gangsta beats, civilize, great men don't make beliefs
Haagan-Daaz, shake the streets
I'm cocained down, and I got a fire to stretch my eats
West to East, South to North, best, the beats
Rest is tef', the Chef defeats
Order this piece -- yo..
Niggas who ain't real, they real when they call the police, my brothers
Watch the slang, lots of lame, pop your frame
And drop your dame, and chop your name
We locked the game, '89 niggas with oxes on us
In front of the building with the same thing


Uh-- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, get your uh-uh-uh-uh
And... (do that dance, grown up, do that dance, grown up)
Look, look, huh, look, huh, party people gath-
Party people gather round
(Do that dance, grown up, do that dance, grown up)


Party people gather round, watch the God get down
The sound's so rugged, measure the erection
It's raw when I'm sexin' your brain
Cherry cream gleen leather seats, lean
Goose in the canteen, dutch leaf green
Blocklet of chocolates, ship a mil', box it
Moms and pops it, plan to be seventy five, live and kicking
Jewels drip in the heat, ribbon with a young sweet
Something in the passenger seat, I greet queen
Bee got the Old Man feeling twenty three
Power-U fat as a peach, I'm Chief Jay Strongbow
From the east, come due Allah, what a beautiful squall
Through the Cartier tints, I seen her from afar
She in her mink trench in her panty and bra
Smooth in silk, naturally built, soy milk breast
Gas at the Hess, slid into the rest
Undress ya'll, and you don't stop, come on!


Do that dance, grown up (come on)
Do that dance, grown up


Yo, I got muscles in my index finger, even my nail is diesel
To scope two, so I could read you
Without a jack, there, I'm still hittin' up people
You were starvin' for beef, I had to feed you
It's funny how Toney got a lot of sons around
Nice dirty crib, with a lot of guns around
Layin' up in Cheetah's, chillin'
Treatin' niggas like cavities, lead rocks'll be in your filling
Bosses, C.E.O.'s, head niggas in charge'll get whacked
Actors, even down to the stars'll get clapped
Skip back, I'm not a bullshit rapper
My gun really do go off like that
This is Ghost, high post, get your pot roast coked
When the Glock burst, it's all about clockwork
Fuck around, and go to hell with a hot shirt
I don't go to Chinatown for my fireworks
I go to Achmed, test him for a bomb, first
Make sure he ain't lyin', tell on me, his eye'll squirt
Ghost Deini is real, me and Killa'll peel
Your cap back, and deliver the mil'
Niggas be pullin' out, but they don't use 'em
Big giant joints, they skate and lose 'em
The big yellow, this shit'll push your crew in
Look you dead in your face, like "What ya'll doing?"
Ain't killin' nothin', so stop pursuing
Fuckin' with my click, you'll just get ruined
Blowin' the weight, like Breezly Bruin
By the way, who the fuck, let ya'll fools in?




My team be bellyaching hungry niggas on the swarm again
Piranha nig bite dick, yo son, it's on again
What up? He made a move, try to assist it
Listen kid yo, you was born to be a pawn but I'm a bishop
Back to the novel, yo Son, it's logical
How you figure God? What? Flow on the track, flip the obstacle
Now my proposal rips the global
From California to courts, it's over God told taste the soul food
Remember baggy jeans, the Timberlands in November
Shorty called me Santa in December
But guess what, my Wally's got messed up
Autograph pressed up what, blessed enough to blow your rest up
We scrape that, Land O' Lake that, Mazola rap
Will get you sent back, represent the gentlemens who bent that
Flash medallions like Italians, la costra nostra
We moving through your hood like we supposed to
Flexing, Lexi Diamonds hold the settlement
To keep the bust your gun boo like that bad ass bitch in Dead Presidents
Ad on the billboard store, check it now, you get the gold dick award
It's like jail and it's the sixth floor
Test me, floating in the S.E., now let's see
Half of y'all niggas built your vine from my stress tree
Faggots, homos, yo, my flavor liver than adobo
Stay militant kid, twist ya like Bolo
You fucking idiot, playing with my Clan but you be fearing it
Fake one, I'm guaranteed to make you take one
Please, y'all niggas money's getting low
But could you come back though, set up shop and get the fat glow?
Tired of y'all, mostly inspired by y'all
So what the deal now, link up with us or put your shield down
Faggot (bitch), you fuck around punk (seven fifteen)
We battle for cream nigga


You want a pound crab? Nah let his hand swing
I ought to punch a hole in his palm with these pointy ass rings
No more said, knew your chump ass was dead
When I saw the .44 reflecting off your shiny forehead
It's Wu-Tang nigga, ain't nothing changed nigga
Still 'Shame on a Nigga', who tried to run game
Your version of perversion, fucking bitches on Persian rugs
Washing niggas like detergent, it's the surgeon
Slugs propels from Bobby Steele's 12 gauge front page "Daily Chronicle" reads
"Hell up in Gotham, take heed and protect your seeds"
You fall like autumn leaves, you lack tranquillity
In your rap utilities to fuck with the abilities
Race like a sperm cell to the ovary
Microphone post tone like a rotary phone, ancient poems of poetry Old scrolls, explosive head bullets, black hooded, Timberland footed ninjas
With 'Full Metal Jacket' clips and know how to put it in you
Surrender your goods and your merchandise for no purchase price, I'm certainly a heist for your ice and curtains and vice
Come quietly, Wu-Tang Clan rules society
Because of variety, so maintain your high anxiety
And lead them to defy me, diary, ya Irie? ...
I need 18 points for my next joint, this high anointed king
To make a deal, I be the one to appoint
Steve Rifkind must have been sniffing
To catch something so dope, it left Monica Lynch pussy dripping
I fuck hundreds of bitches and split millions of dollars
And built with thousands of scholars
My life saga from the hill to the harbor, legal kid brown in Nicaragua
Gave birth to MCs, thieves and bank robbers
We drove expensive whips and took worldwide trips
And my dick's been sucked by the finest lips
Fancy delicatessens and the world's best refreshment
But none of the above compare to the one-twenty lessons
Or my queen and my seeds in the home that I rest in
Enter my zone get blown in 99 sections


This rhyme has no limitation, this time there's no hesitation
Collecting minds at the door
You want it niggas it's yours, the flavors raw
What the fuck you think I'm flowing for? It's rhyme and reason
Bite the bullet, niggas is fowl and it's duck season
We at odds till we even motherfucker
Bad asses, high times, lower classes
Taste mine, straight shots in dirty glasses
Bring it to him, room service, under pressure
And mad nervy, waving guns at the clergy
Ticallion, we ain't worried, keep them sick niggas 7-30
Picture this, watch the birdy
These Bastards is Ol' and Dirty, with sharp hymns
That be stabbing you, pins and needles, needles and pins
'Nough said, dick in your mouth like Tempest Bled'
As I race track with thoroughbreds, ducking the Feds


Yo, my ice look fly upon the keyboard son
Niggas ran up on me lord, praising what we do by the laws
That's right, exile the fake, hit them niggas like weight
Feed 'em food, let the fake evaporate
Reconstruction, that's the whole science on my, production
Y'all niggas guess who stuck son, left his nuts hung
Switch, finger itch, staring at you like a bitch
Maybe y'all niggas snitched
You's a loner, Adidas shell top while I
Sip a Corona, read the Robb Report, then bone her
Buy you some jewels, here's some food
Not necessarily mean to be rude boo, check out the analoo
We in the mushrooms, chased the high neck in the custom
Baggy jeans, thick ropes god, sliding through customs
Chill, y'all niggas know what time it is
James Bond beamers behind me on Bacardi Limon
Check out the pitch like Nolan Ryan, he caught a slug for lying
Yeah you was lying, where's the cash, crying
Militia, rolling in position
Casa Blanca Cuban Link Christian
Lex retali' back whistling fake fucks {*echoes*}




Yo, shorty, man
Yo, I been seeing you, man, for real, man, come on, man
Yo, man, tell your girl let me sleep with her, man
I give you a thousand grams


He throw blow in lands, hit good pussy up, kush me up
My dough is advanced and rover with the lambskin coat on
Lighting reefer, my mans and them
We got plans, man, but first show me where the grams went
Ten fold scheme in the doorway, we all the way in now
What they rolling for? We blowing them bowling balls
Rifle with the knife on it, lifers jump right up on it
Maseratis double piping, wrist lightning
I rhyme for the flight men, the drug boys, thug noise
They want, they come get it from me, it's like done
I'm just a scholar with some street drug news, plug dudes
No kidnappings, we mug dudes, I love jewels
Might take your man shit, up in the jam and shit
Listening to Eric B. and Rakim planning shit
I'm all for the vandal shit, good nights
Bet I got a good gun with long bullets and a Taruga light
Come to the palace, chalices, hood pussy from Dallas
All of this is childish, I allowed this
Rap saved the babies, all these young niggas with these 3-80's
Fronting like they robbed down Macy's
Stop it, we them cockpit boys, we got shit
Plus pop shit, grab your bird twatty; obnoxious
Flashin' knots and shit, yachts that smell like piss
It's all good, we only fucking in her mouth, partner
The lock men, I rock, was robbing, met her out in Africa
Yeah, yeah, bought her my Glock, let me hold that man...


We the Dutch Masters, the blunts with the gun flashers
Love maxing, watch niggas last moves
Keep it cool, get those ones, play the building
Get your run game on, and stay stashing


Aiyo, octopus hands, slash backs of the gold rolly
Shootouts in the liquor store, my man on parole owe me
Old man freedom still preaching on the block
Still talking, you can't sling drums and hold a walkman
Fishcale dumped inside the quarter water juices
Staircase madness, the hammer stash gooses
Went to time flow, yo I heard they let Shyne go
Big whip spaces, betting at the horse races
Old school wit it, banging Julio Iglesias
Suaded leather seats, feet reclined, line back of moves
Homey with the chipped tooth from Faragent, he arrogant
Did a bid with him, gave him razors in the church hall
Then he turn Muslim, Jihad to hurt ya'll
Hooligan goon shit, never onto FUBU
Never on computers, niggas never heard of Google
Mink slippers lounging with the cashmere headband
Still spending Euro's, Germany, Dresden
Dubai high, drinking all the French water
Champagne-yah, my campaign a, macarena
Aim a flamer, his accent was Dana Daner
I mean Dana Dane, distribution crazy 'caine
Elvis sideburns, his appearance always crazy lame
Move big weight though, winnebago
Remind me of Dego, and Jose Canseco
The man in San Diego, that's where he lay low
His soldiers do what he say so, all day though
Yeah, little nigga you gotta respect protocol
That's where you come from homeyboy


Aiyo, cigar niggas, Phillies my favorite
Beat the affidavit, that good weed, you save it
Run through the alleyways, ever since the valley days
We been on that New York shit but smoking Cali haze


Aiyo, five grams crushed in a bill fold, he snorted it
Coke professor, test it before he ordered it
Lamping on a La-Z-Boy, real McCoy, flick the ashes
Champagne bitches is butt naked, filling glasses
Whips with the mean stashes, ox spitting gun clappers
Onasis money, she fly with the package
Easy Wider rider nigga, I'm a bamboo vandal
Ran through cities, looking for white paper, that rice papers
That bullshit, the back of the Bibles, the light saver
I blow joints to the head, Al Queda raider
Black bandanna, old hammer, phone scrambler
Niggas wearing wires cuz shit bad, lit on fire
Old school marvels, pardon the middle, waves bust to the side
Still rocking diddy bop like '85
Them pinky rings, diamond crust Diors is diamonds dusted, trust it
My niggas rob to rob niggas, so fuck it
Hip hop awards, I was low in them bucket, blowing kisses at Toya Luckett
Before that I was backstage puffing


For my bamboo niggas, lay low playing the benches, relentless
Fresh home from a sentence
You know the rules, get your money and move, blast tools
Clap dudes, keep they ear to the streets with tattoos



We're not gonna fall for a banana in the tailpipe
You're not gonna fall for the banana in the tailpipe
You should be more natural brother
It should flow out like this
Look man
I ain't falling for no banana in my tailpipe
(?)
You've been hanging with this dude too long
I'm sorry I'm just fucking with you
That's funny to me, I'm sorry




A general can never live with the shame of defeat
Play the position the same way in the street, labeled a creep
Raised in the ways of the deep thinkers at the same time
I learned the most valuable things
From an uncle leaving syringes stuck in his veins
Heroin dreams, cocaine wishes
Seen a dope fiedn suck a dog's dick for a fix and
It's twisted and sick on this immaculate planet on which we live
That's why I keep a black bag of ammonia by my side ever since
Hollow tip shells, one in the chamber
Sign my name in blood, smudgen the paper
Too many crab motherfuckers and haters
Looking at me like I fucked their moms
Till they wind up hog tied in the trunks of their cars
It ain't no sunshine, I can smell the jealousy and envy
You're thinking my glass is half full, I'm thinking it's half empty
I think above the law, surpass insanity
Smear your blood on the wall like the Manson Family
Wtahc your mouth you don't know me homie
Ill Bill, inappropriate like holding a baby, smoking a bogie
Blow your brains out; leave you with an empty head, cause I'm a muthafucking villain like MC Ren


I live the same life you lead, breathe the same air you breathe
We similar, but no, you my enemy
Bang the fuck out in the street, hold the block down with heat
We similar, but no, you my enemy


From every valley all the way to the valley is where allies live
With 40 Calies, winging drugs, selling Denalies
Where coke comes in big ol trucks, Dickies, white tees
Authentic Chucks, stash it in the boards for the cause
Alot of rap killers is lurking, base heads chirping
All these police workers got they hats backwords, and black hoods
Guard it like the Pope up in Rome
Slight cough, rhyming through foam, pajama sets, talking to Tone
I live through my family, civilians and loved ones
Take drugs and slay for my paper
Working under some fakers
I recognize the power of loyalty, come for the wants and needs
Everything else black, self explanatory
Take it back to Timexes and Outies
Push it through 1-39th, seeing Spanish, Jesus and Ralphie
You know who we came, it's holding besides breaded was lead
Go head, search us, guns is by the shoulders
You counting every one in back of the store
Different whores will jump out, different walls smelling like cum
Nowadays niggas know hustling
Yeah, go head, tell it wrong and get jinxed by the FBI
Word to every kingpin's wish
Move humble and hard, play the right men, slay the right bitch
Through the mix of concurrent drama
We honor niggas that died, got trapped up and fell behind karma
This real nigga lecture his destiny
Play the perfect hand of perfection, everything's a blessing at heart
I sat back like the giant from start, play number two position learn
To listen, gamble insmarts
Now we pushing from town to town
Realizing credit's the shit, but can't trust no niggas around
I try to establish life on my own, blaze a hundred bones
And think, I'm painting by the second, it's on
Yo, call the flag of a Muslim son, who base his life on guns and murder
Free business, handling chumps
Now alot of niggas is gone, sleeping on the Rican on the catwalk
Hump on his leg, back on his own
A wise man set up for failure


Yo, yo, yo, untie him man






Ever since I was 13, my biggest problem has been just to find the right road to get to that rainbow that everybody talks about
Like most people get close enough to count the stripes
But they don't have enough guts to reach out and take that pot of gold

What up my dude, you know
Going through a lot and all that man
That's why you be strong, you know what I'm saying
Feel great boy (Staten Island over yeah)
It's going now ()
Holla at the kid
(Let's go chef)


I'm flawless, the gowns that I rock is cashmere
Then roam through the lab with the hammer and black Airs
Thinking 'bout plans that's real, laying the bill
Drop a new classic album, my masters will
Enlighten your mind, I'm writing on times
When the youth reach real situations and they thoughts are blind
You know when I float a moment is fine, glass of wine
New elegance, the greeze just pass through the mind again
What happened, rap made it happen, back when
Two turn tables and a needle, action
We all huddled up, that's it, classic shit
Only our kind adapt to shit
Start rapping 'bout cracks and Pimps, cash to get
Call it C.R.E.A.M. now, no grind don't ask for shit
We bastard thick, pass the spliff


Name of this piece is called "my bitch better have my money" (applause)
My bitch better have my money, through rain, sleet or snow
My ho better have my money
Not half, not some, but all my chash
Because if she don't, I'mma put my foot in her ass




Know what you gotta do
Straight up

Yah, yo
I'm raw, dinosaur chain, never been a lame
We aim, straight C.R.E.A.M., makin paper, make exchange
Yo, catch me yo, while the Fed's try to snatch me
Whips and fly shit, match me actually, cat
Build like crypts from the ground up
We gon' keep flow until we drown, what?
Bust loud sounds up, steamy Remy on my mind
You best to gimme mines, rep' for this family is in mind


Instant pressure everyday
Can't let it stop my pay
See I got money anyway
Solid ground's where I plan to stay
Ohh-wee


It's up to me, it's guaranteed, security, financially
Whatever it takes to make ends meet
Each and everyday, yeah
It's up to me, to make meak
Nobody else, but me, but me
That's why am I here in these streets
Doin what I gotta do, oh-whoa-oh


Everyday, I'm hustlin in these streets
To get the things I need
Big house and a roof on me
Iced out jewelery


Every way, still follow and you'll see
To get the final things
High every day of the week, women every nationality


Willing to take any raise
To have a things I'm used to
I'll take on the consequence
Just do what I gotta do








Yo, yo
Now what the fuck y'all know about paying rent?
We stayin bent, with the real young limp
Runnin the strip yo, runnin with hoes with names
Intelligence rows the game, drivin fast foreign shit
Killa chain, make half, fox pull inf', cash on the strength
Shoes alligator, get 'em scared, we worldwide in the ghetto
Immobilizing rise from the ghetto, came to take pies out the ghetto
Max do what, yo, relax, count stacks
Blow tracks LV, make your voice scratch
Scrape that, silk shit on, bottle of Dom
Ice little bit of shit on
Grab the shorty up, sing a song





Ya, ya, ya, come on, man!
Keep it moving, man, this ain't real efficient shit, man
You know what I'm saying?
I mean chill out man
Chill out my old girl, name Faith, hey, what's up?
Know what time it is, man?
Did ye shit all day, man?
Word up, man!
What a fucking role is that?

It's funny how the world just turns around
Everything that goes up, just know that it might be coming down
And nothing new under the sun
Everything's already been done
Listen to the words of this song!
If you're coming from the right place you could never go wrong
Life can just pass you by
So I just keep my head to the sky


Well, we got to figure out
How to just broke it out
Nothing's more precious than time!
I'll tell you what life's about, people gotta work it out!
Open your mind! Open your mind!
To get to the right! To get to the right!

Let me tell you something unknown!
You gotta be more careful of the things that you wish for!
Just like king Minos, I was told!
Just like king Minos, I was told!
Everything that glitters and glows
And if you really know how God works
Damn, she's mean...
Anything is possible
But you've got to just put Him first!
He holds the world in his hands
I'll understand if someone explains


Come on, we got to figure out
How to just work it out!
We got to figure out...
Nothing's more precious than time!
Nothing is more precious than time!
I'll tell what life's about, people gotta work it out!
Open your mind! Open your mind!
To get to the right! To get to the right!

Work it out, work it out!

You know the struggle is on maintain
Refuse to go back between...

Most of the ground made me define
But every time we're in, we're lost
To keep the love be, open your heart!
I invested in well and their success is as special as hell
To many black clouds broke out the day I caught myself I smoked out
Wish I had a moment to sell!
A moment to sell...
A moment to be what you wanna
Me I'm just a genius of...
That's what's real, makes us confront it
My stand my personality, this is my reality
Keep it moving you can do it!
From the... and I've been borne to...
Try to stay rich in the heart, stay strong
Stay strong...
It really makes me repeat it

Peace repeated!

What we've got to figure out
How to just work it out!
Nothing's more precious than time!
Nothing is more precious than time!
I'll tell what life's about, people gotta work it out!
Open your mind to get to the right!
Open your mind to get to the right!
And you've got to figure out, how to just break it out
Nothing's more precious than time!
Cause the world just turns around!
I'll tell what life's about, people gotta work it out!
Open your mind! Open your mind!
To get to the right! To get to the right!
You can get to the right way

It's just a hobby that I've picked
Nothing that I'll need
Word up! Everything is will!
... fame
This is their meaningless...
Love protects everyone!




To every soldier in the hood, go in
To every real nigga holding, keep your ones on folding
Take it from a ninja and scribe, stay alive
Keep rolling, and keep your guns on swollen


Aiyo, joint loaded, Lotus, big chain cobras
Cloth the certain way, notice
My style's new now, with generals luau, drugs, guns
Chilling on the cool out, don't make me pop you, this is not cool
Guaranteed to give you something that works, you're dumped in the dirt
Shitting up blood, fingers is burnt
Many cycles when you fight in my walls, it's like Michael and the Bulls
See a flying piece of iron, no lying
No fib and no bullshitting, the shines is forbidden
We like Crouching Tiger, you just a fucking kitten
Bout to get that wig re-open and then smoked in
Bitches is watching, snatch you in the open, yo
Twenty-four, seven, we legends, the myth, the riff the gift
Shaolin bounded with more whiff
Clap 'em with them get down boys, we call them the niggas
Who want it with us, we the belt holders in the business




Yo, ay, the streets be calling and shit
A lot of veterans be calling it quits
They be calling my flow ill, but still I'm never calling in sick
This is Meth Man, New York niggas calling me piff
Fuck the cops that be calling me Cliff, flag me down on the Concord
Police dogs all up in my whip
I get cake, women all in mix, they wanna jump in the six
And groupie niggas wanna jump in your flicks
We live the life, Scarfaces and guns, I used to fight for crumbs
Throw an ace, kick the dice and run
Plead your case, you ain't nice as son, I got the drive to win
So where you niggas get your license from?
Bite an ear, Mike Tyson, uh, that means dough and my nose itch
And coke fiends is blowing they noses
My team got cream and you know this
So nigga get yours, before the door to opportunity closes





"Execute them" 


"Slang bang to wax, torture pack, pump it to max
Till your heart collapse, fully auto rap
Might lose your eye sight, blood type, a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype"


Yeah, y'all mothafuckers know, turn my shit up mothafucker
Wild the fuck out, word up fuck the radio
1998 word up, whippin illegal on y'all beagle-lookin mothafuckers
Yo, James spin off, slang dames wanna hit off
Czechoslovak' lock it down, lames get off
Jury match, range rack, fists of fury-act
Don po, six hundred glow, Wally mack poly like that
It's real ("Execute Them"), diabolical
Logical, strange chokehold, kill is possible
Flip a wig blindfold, rewind the scroll
Clip full-mo, flip on the glow, blow
Rock a arm-fold, tourist a bull report
Sit back, calmful, Timberland cold war
Hailin from my next down, rounds clip clowns
Buyin a loyal bitch gowns, go down, fuck them clowns
While we healin, minds, wheelin labs wit cathedral ceilings
Dryer, hitman for hire, alien flyer
"Slang bang to wax, slang bang to wax, slang slang bang to wax
Torture pack"
What what, step up, throw your sword up


Aiyyo witness the abduction, villa destruction
Blood rushin, from a universal standpoint
A lotta shorties bustin, but they gotta cum some
Before they can test my steel
I send a grandson to let em feel one, bodies not worth my gun
PC don, w-w-MastaKill.com, heavily armed
We roam, through the dark damp litter of the forest
Exploerer lives gold, bless em wit a c-note, throw em overboat
Slit his stomach so the body won't float
The vigilant, infinite patient I stand as commanding chief
Mad thorough, competition's intense from every inch of the borough

"Slang bang to wax, torture pack, pump it to the max
Till your heart collapse, fully auto rap" 
"Might lose your eyesight, bloodtype, a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype
(Execute them) I live to write the hype"


Murder verser, twenty beam rap fiend server
Rhymes nurture minds, bustin like twin burners
Certified live, five million eyes left wide
Inside we split the grand prize
Won it by a landslide, dance by the rest
They fit in contest but they pose no threat
Street corner warrior, cause crowd disorder
And glide like rollerblades 'cross your recorders
Soldier of fortune lost in the madness
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Po' bandit hold the belt single-handed
Most Demanded Assassin is what I'm branded
Far from your standard, universally
Planted jewels in the minds of fools left stranded
One man hit force, my shirt ripped off
Squeeze a full clip to kill the bullshit then I dip off

"Slang bang, slang bang to wax (Execute Them)
Torture pack, pump it to the max till your heart collapse
Fully auto rap, might lose your eyesight, bloodtype a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype"
"Execute them" 
"Slang bang to wax, torture pack pump it to max till your heart collapse"
"Sla-slang bang to wax (Execute them)
Torture pack, pump it to the max till your heart collapse (Execute them)
Fully auto rap, might lose your eyesight, bloodtype a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype
I live to write the hype






You stepped in the pit of the flame
You're lost on Beat Street, I'mma throw spit on your name
Hear the roar when they mention the name
It's like Mike when he score with like two seconds left in the game
Small change don't step in my lane
I rock too hardbody, I click-bang, give 'em the pain
Nah man, can't get with them games
Your boy born with it, so how you gon' get him to change
You a lame putting shit in the game
Piranha wanna see me in the state greens and prisoner chains
But I'm smooth like the groove to the listener brain
And you only understand it if you been through my pain
Icy white spitters in frames
Hustle in my blood, bet my seeds gon' get it the same
Yes indeed I'm destined to reign, so ahead of the game
All aboard y'all get on the train


Banana clip Mac-aholic, I slap your cap then join
Go in the freezer, got a skeezer tits out the toilet
Niggas is Norbits, running up on a dice game, call it
Preacher suit on, holding a raw fifth
Put that call in, his dough in the wall, stall him
Plastic bags laying in the floorway, yep
It's just dog's day, reservoir out in Utah, yo
Where my dope and marijuanas got bought in
Real Nikes, afford 'em, we pay to have a roast
Assassins is strapped, this the only way the yay grows
More leverage, more sevens, riding around with legends
Paying judges off, we be up in New York repping


Miramax movie magic, cold beer on tap, rumor has it
Words put ideas on track
Footprints, I walk on Earth and appear on maps
Strive for at least 2.5 mill a year on cap
Wu Wear on my cap, dime piece on the lap
Three hundred push-ups a day put the crease on your back
Be the cap-fitting lieutenant black man
Who invented chopping samples up, to make the beats that's ascended to
Every genre of music, the whole sphere of music
I produced, arranged, engineered the music


My ear candy been dope, my pen stroke like Zorro
Hit the heavy bag like Foreman in the Congo
Mini transmitter, night vision in the stronghold
Rock long robes, smell snakes with a strong nose
Every time the horn blow the Wu signal's back on
Transform, pack form, a whole 'nother platform
We coming back for 'em to smash the spot, kid
I'm on your team too, pass me the rock
Til the casket drop I'mma flip your wig
Rip clothes, honey didn't know my dick this big
You get kicked in the ribs with two chrome gauge
Deadly venom, I send 'em back to stone age




As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines


Let me start from the beginning, at the top of the list
Know wha'mean, Hav, situation like this
Another war story from a thirsty young hustler
Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya, and leave your corpse
For the cops to discover, while I be pimping in the Range Rover
All jewelled like Liberace
You watch me while Jakes trying to knock me and lock me
But I'll be on the low sipping Asti Spumante
Niggas try to creep on the side of my Jeep
Stuck the heat through the window rocked they ass to sleep
Over a 3-pack, it was a small thing really, yeah
But keep letting them small things slide and be a failure
If I'm out of town one of my crew'll take care of ya
The world is ours and your team's inferior
You wanna bust caps I get all up in your area
Kidnap your children make the situation scarier
Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny
I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
Plus the outcome turns out to be lovely
Got cheese in my pocket hit off my main squeeze
Push back the sunroof, let the cold air breeze
Through the butter soft leather upholestry
But mostly, keep the gat closely cause niggas wanna toast me


A-yo I gotta get mines, no matter what the consequences
Count all my blessings, add up my weapons
Cock back the gat, let my nine serve purpose
Sling, do my thing, organized fiend service
Trying to make a mil is stress you know the deal
So we sling krills, get your cap peeled, cause everything is real
Cause I wanna chill, laid up in a jacuzzi
Sipping bubbly with my fingers on the Uzi
Try to infiltrate my fort get caught
Dead up in New York, my brain is packed with criminal thoughts
Get your life lost never found again my friend
Mission completed, watch you drop in less than ten
On my road to the riches, hitting snitches off with mad stitches
Your last resting place'll be a ditch kid
No one can stop me, try your style's sloppy
You want to be me, you're just an imitation copy
My theme is all about making the green
Living up in luxury, pushing phat whips and living comfortably


As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines


A drug dealer's dream:
Stash Cream, keys on a triple beam
Five hundred SL green, ninety-five nickle gleam
Condominium, thug dressed like the gentleman
Tailor made ostrich, Chanel for my women friend
Murdering, numbers on your head while I'm burglaring
Shank is serving 'em
What's up to all my niggas swerving in New York metropolis
The Bridge brings apocalypse
Shoot at the clouds feels like, the Holy Beast is watching us
Mad man my sanity is going like an hourglass
Gun inside my bad hand I sliced trying to bag grams
I got hoes that used to milk you, niggas who could've killed you
Is down with my ill crew of psychos
Nas Escobar moving on your weak production
Pumping corruption in the third world we just busting


Hold up and analyze the wildcats slang cracks
They swingin Ac's, the new routines, be my eyes black's
Playing corners glancing all up in your cornea
Corner ya, seen cats snatch monies up on ya
But late night, candlelight fiend with a crack pipe
It's only right, feeling higher than an airplane right
Word yo, I want to get this money then blow
Take my time, blast a nine, if you front you go
Sip beers, the German ones, hand my guns to sons
Shaolin, and Queensbridge we robbing niggas for fun
But still, write my will out to my seeds then build
Mahalia sing a tale but the real we still kill


As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines


Laid back, word out
Jus' bless 'em, with the bulletproof
Mobb Deep, Nas, Chef creation
For yo' nation, YEAH!








As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shine can light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines


First of all the foundation, money is the root of all evil
The cream will have you shitting on your people
Living like lotto, everything is everything
Ain't nothing changed but the clothes that my money bring
I'm Making figures that I never thought was possible
You try to slow me down you'll find yourself in the hospital
My crew got the army of Tec-xuses and the Mac-uras
Kid you'll get your cap peeled backwards
For years, I've been trying to blow for years
Getting bent off Mot, spending a G on beers
Living life to the fullest, my story ends with a bullet
Til the coke oil drop to the bottom of the pot
My invincible crew will never stop
If you looking, you can find me rising to the top
I'm a classic, approach my level and get your ass kicked
Floating in the river with your body wrapped in plastic
Im trying to make a half a million triple in size
Before my eyes, another part of my team died
I can still hear his voice while he up in the sky
While the rest still living steady telling me lies
It's like a bad dream and I can't wake up
But at the same time I love it and I can't give it up


I got your life in arms reach, With a slug for each and any
The clip is filled up I'm hitting til its fucking empty
Presenting, the hollow tip crew, take heed to the message that we sending at you
Choking off your own blood watch you face turn blue
Ain't that some shit, the damage that a bullet can do
Make you change the way you thinking, niggas speed while you blinking, too late
On your way home, you left a trail leaking
I bet you next time you'll listen up while I'm speaking
Now you're laid up in ICU for the weekend
At the same time I'm outside getting my thug on
The same eyes got my mind fucking bugging




A drug dealer's dream:
Stash CREAM, keys on a triple beam
Five hundred SL green, ninety-five nickle gleam
Condominium, thug dressed like a gentleman
Tailor made ostrich, Chanel for my women friend
Murdering, numbers on your head while I'm burglaring
Shank is serving 'em, what's up to all my niggas swerving in
New York metropolis, the Bridge brings apocalypse
Shoot at the clouds feels like, the holy beast is watching us
Mad man my sanity is going like an hourglass
Gun inside my bad hand I sliced trying to bag grams
I got hoes that used to milk you, niggas who could've killed you
Is down with my ill crew of psychos
Nas Escobar moving on your weak production
Pumping corruption in the third world we just busting


My teams hot collecting mad cream, we slingshot
My ring's rock icy like a fuck with a green drop
Call me santa with more snow than montana
Camouflage Wu emblem on my bandana
Play fair sight, never in a million these cats bite
Folding under pressure like beach chairs
Drug money, hundred dollar nights plus flights around the way
Burning biggys on bikes its only right
Two for fives 95, five 25s didn't I
Rewind glaciers mixtape niggas throwing eyes
Check dates, my whole crew making they Tec's spray
Shooting ninas off sideways we know it




Beat downs galore, kids walk away holding they jaws
Wishin they had yours, tours posters plus sneaker stores
Balls be gettin licked kid on whatever airline
Restroom style courtesy from stewardess, the bitch washed mine
Shellbox nines never been popped, Knowledge Bill shots
Israelis be hittin me, Bing's death made the store hot
Jewels gleam, niggas beam, whole team labelled wally king
Goldie brought a pair, Chinese man dot him with the green
World's greatest, Las Vegas payed us, rap crusaders
Casino champs, Gods sport the latest
Today's math, fuck nuthin but ass, take Cristal baths
Go half on his robbery, we run up on Johnny Cash
Kid's invicible, back to back screws, Wu's suspenseful
You get lynched, starks will play it cool like a mint
Like a night out, whitey's callin me like a double date
Alkies get the shanks, yo it's swine inside Hostess cakes
Yo my man, check the moral or get deaded
You bust a shot and that big bullet was unleaded
Word up






Last time they saw this movie
It was on regular screens
We ain't had no HD
No Imax
Now we got 3D goggles to watch this shit
Popcorn extra buttery
Extra sauce, 2 on that
Okay


He just buckin out in broad daylight
Started from play fights
Niggas slap box and then you stop like a brake light
I rock a Rolex but never got my time straight
I can't see shit something like a blind date
Pyrex vision, hologram cocaine
And when I gas niggas I call it propane
I used to hustle with the peeps under the boxers
And my little pocket stash, allin top rockers
And weed up for my dude Made Enrique
He also uptown but he live out in BK
Used to say DK, Diablo, papo
Partners with Pablo, heroin, italiano
Flush the work, overseas gots the work
Yellow Lambo, used to let it off like Rambo
Sambo consignin, he's wheels need aligning
How the fuck you gonna go to war with a boss
With your paper in your right
And your crew hat's off
Smirnoff whackin shots, vacant lot parking lots
Sour with the scritorillo, nigga I don't care to be
Seat nigga like toilets, fuck it I'm a shit a bit


Ready or not, here I come
Red berry Siroc, red dots on em
Marvin Gaye, know you heard through the grape vine
That dope getting stepped on, great one
Everything you did I did every time
Let the fountains fly like the anytime
Man I never thought I'd really make it
You see Medusa face on my pillow case
With them doors on, point the goal and
Your bitch gon swallow, we with no head
Montana shit, I been on the first track
Getting all this head and I ain't learned yet
Pimpin them hoes, 6 in the yacht
Dippin the Rolls, your bitch in the back
Uh, word to pong, I'm clappin off
Catch you in the ap fore you turn your burnies off the saw


You goin in the back, straight off the back
Peoples actin crazy, hit em with the mack
Pull out the Jag, cause that's what all they had
Up here in the streets you know the goons parasite
N.O.R.E. we deep in this bitch
SP rockin in the streets in this bitch
Middle fingers up, you don't really give a fuck
Niggas is tryna hustle just to make a fuckin buck
Just to make a fuckin buck, just to make a fuckin buck
Niggas let you down just to make a fuckin buck
Aye, it's real out there, it's real out there
Them haters think you killed out there, killed out there
Man you a liar, set your house on fire
Ain't nothing man, I think you wear a wire
Hang him off the roof with a noose
Goddamn it and let the goons loose


Golden monk drunk, how they take pieces of gold?
Shave a nigga face, machete niggas quake
Indoors with whores, they soldiers
How at they go? We gon poke kill fly ride and roll
The most insane destroying grocers
With more back, it's scoliosis
Yo I'm runs in frontin, land best pull in shore
With the red clock on, no question
Build for the reserves, I just swerve laughin, I'm usually around birds
Not since once one strapped in
All at a time, mackin a lap on my dime
I just advise niggas, stay on your grind
4-50 game, never nigga what
I'm shutted most better, we will sever your son
Out the slum with the vultures, dinosaur chains and roadsters
Don't come around, we approaches


See when I come through, I never fear
You got em
I'm like a sniper with a riffle
Even my hood get it bad


Look, deeper than them lost troubles and badge
I'm walkin through a lane full of riches
You see all of these diamonds drippin off it
And you get to pourin wine in my glass
Havin a seat and listen to science
Odometers sparkling, glisten off me
We ball until they call police and they tryna report me
We washin all his brand like a nigga doing the laundry
See a nigga tryna chill while you niggas tryin to force me
Bitches cleanin my ratchets, I'm a get to blammin em shortly
Where the fuck you tryna step up like you some kind of contendant
You's a bitch, reminding me of some kind of a sex offender
I'll burn you to a crisp, leaving nothing more than your digit
You hear the family bitch, I enherit the name defending
Nothing's surprising bout niggas like you up on a stretcher
And squeeze until they leak, it's all like applying the pressure, pause
You probably should went in higher you will protect the cause
Ban it from TV set, but a movie don't wreck the boss




Face the problems that everyone's found
We must replace what we took out of the ground
Face the problems that everyone's found
We must replace what we took out of the ground


The echo from machine gun rounds simmers
And a fallen soldier, his weapon hangs on his shoulder, lights get dimmer
Key swingin' back and forth in the ignition
The stench was only part of the horrible condition
As he waits for the smoke to clear
All he heard was the blast from in the bombs that kept ringin' in his ear
Along with gun-bearin' troops with fatigues and wearin' boots
From miles away, whether night or day they hear 'em shoot
It's a very unforgivin' and hostile environment
The military hardware, the only requirement
A world with a decease is just a thing of the past
Every advance is more costly than the last
The president's madness is responsible for losses
Political forces, land littered with corpses
Like the youth from the streets that gambled and get scarred
Even the troops in the field bet it all for one cause


Face the problems that everyone's found
We must replace what we took out of the ground


We grew up y'all, die-hard dummies, pourin' coke and guns
Violence was near so hallways were plungy
Dirty jean, hoodie on boys, stealin' stereos to get on
I did my first crime when I was born
Young king  realize
Life'll put you in a short spot, gun cocked, we was already signed
Day to day slingin', til once, we formed an ill line
Dynamic duos, all we did was threw O's
Police chased us in buildings, different places
This is real then, do me a favor, keep it from children
We was bad guys, stressin' for money
Regulate and start a strong clique, I was that nigga, don't forget
Time to time thinkin' 'bout time, little time left
Time piece is on, new Nikes, switchin' nines
In the buildin', pourin' out rhymes, don't let the cycle happen again
You might get trapped if you rewind




Staten Africa, move through the rat holes with the hunger
All the Jakes, look Archie Bunker
Scheme on your cracks, plot, and jump yah
I can't wait to get out, released from the barracks
So I can chop more , hunt gems
My army got lion's dens
See through your technology, advanced behavior
Renewal of the street mind, I speak mine
Little kids run through your hall, addicted to spray paint
Thugs clash with the unjust, it's untrust in these hallways
But love always, all of my dudes from back in the days
We 'place hard times with better ways
On some grown man shit, gettin' that child support paid
Never call out 
Mothafuck what you heard, it's the gods in here
Never slack on that music, it's very sincere






Know what im sayin? You on the corners and shit. Ya know?
Just gotta be on something. Hands down shit. YaknowhatImean?
Just keepin ya eyes and ears open at all times
While we rhyme and shine. For my dedicated niggas
Who love this shit. We doin this like this. Word up
What's the phenomenon? Carry on Don. Tranquilizin

Ay yo, movin' on these niggas like they old soul, bro
You know how we go, we go shift 'em out like pelico
Fine, proteges off top connectin' like a buildin'
Four dollar whylin' niggas buildin', savin' the children
Come on now, check out the view like a oceanfront
Slow motion in cunt, takin' what we want
You know a kid asiatic, holdin' power like a Craftmatic
You like your fish fried or battered, that day he ratted
Check out the movies from Guyana, just eatin' in Atlanta
Makin' some pirate moves out of Savannah
Yeah, rock them niggas like jewelry
Arabics movin' blow like aerobics
That's when his nose itch, yeah
That means it's all in effect
I'm hittin' you, I'm hittin' Buddha
Island Bermuda, send that twenty-shot Ruger
Continue to slam and mend you like a venue
Get all up in you, oh yeah your friend too, respect Wu
Yeah, keep the faggot niggas watery
Rhyme for rich niggas who supported me, shorty pussy extorted me
So it's a science now, RZA, cuttin' they pockets like scissors
Cindafella found him a Wally slipper
Splashin' ends in the glass Benz in Nevada
Flashin' gems, eight-and-a-half Timb state robber
All my life been on some foul shit besides kidnap a child shit
Get on some foul and proud shit
Cheatin' many Koreans bein' all that I can be an'
Put down on thirty keys an' get to fleein'
Light up a tree an'
Don't be breezin' like a blow dryer
Yo, you's a liar like Jeremiah gamin' on the flyer
Yo, Barbarian niggas is carryin'
Thug drug marryin', hittin' Marion off at the Clarion
All my Spanish niggas love us
We movin' like Russia, bone crusher
At the flick, stick the usher
Broke niggas, spot 'em like Cascade
In the street masquerade
Faster Blade




{I'm tired of them muthafuckas down the block
Every time I come outside, them niggas ---}
Aiyo, some major station radio {aiyo, come on, hurry up}
Get the joint, {hurry up, son}, kill all those niggas man
We going Ricky Retardo on them niggas
{Everybody just shut the fuck up
I'm tired of using this muthafucking grenade right now}
What you seen stupid?
You don't even know what you talking bout, man
You fabricating the wrong shit, man
Both of them niggas were stand up niggas, man
Niggas went to war! You know how it go
In order to be a general, nigga, you still gotta be a soldier (Gotta
Kill ya bloodclot)
Speak about what happened then, man, for real, fuck it, aiyo --
Check this out, man, what niggas is doing over here, man?
(Why you think ya gangsta?) Yo Dred, man, word up, man
(Why ya'll dont know nothing) This is ours, man, we own all this right here, man
(Who you? Who ya talk about?) Straight up, man, we know how real it could get
(Who ya talk to to?) But it's gon' be repercussions


Punch broke the Dred's jaw, pulled the four out
And went off, told him that he can't sling his raw
When he fell, yo, he broke his wrist, his bangles flew off
His Balley's was scuffed, then he blew a kiss
Bleeding out the side of his ear, niggas was staring
And the silk shirt was ripped off, Punch cut his hair
Razors was bloody, he kept hitting, Dred grabbed his shirt
Showing his stomach, the kid had zippers on him
Bitches was flipping, they grabbed Tasha, caught her for a Louis
Snatched her titties right up out the bitch bra
No selling over here, Jack, heard the Dred mumble
'You be dead in a week' then he stumbled back
Little young Keyon rushed him, yeah, shorty was a vet
Gillette soldiers, shorty hit the neck
Blood squirted, look like laundry detergent, the Dred fell out
Right from there, he gon' need a surgeon
You ain't dead yet?


The fat lady sings, the fat lady sings, the fat lady sings
The fat lady sings, the fat lady sings, the fat lady sings




My niggas flippin' it all day
Either on the corners or up in the hallways
Coke from Cuba, but they got it on Broadway
Pitchers on the front stoop, shooters in the doorway
...you a marble in the jacuzzi
The elevator ride to the top'll make you woozy
Either shootin' the Uzi or the MK
Starter in the game, you just get in when the bench play
At your door with the four, "bonjour" like the French say
Nigga you just plain, cut you up like a sensei
Take you down like the statue at Penn State
Get you off your feet like an Olajuwon head fake
Come, come, comin' with Havoc to bring the havoc
Lightin' the chronic, Techtronics and automatics
Beware of the short niggas
Yeah I'm cool, but I'll motherfuckin' torch niggas


All along...
Been them niggas that been reppin' in your favorite rap songs
Hold it for the hood, it's money over broads
And we hustle in the cold 'til the whole pack gone
All along...
Been them niggas that been reppin' in your favorite rap songs
Hold it for the hood, it's money over broads
And we hustle in the cold 'til the whole pack gone


I'm one in a million, diamond in the rough
Supplying that stuff that got every whip that I drive
Tough lion took steroids, olympian status
Gold medalling them niggas, ain't nothin' 'bout me average
Cannons bigger than me, we go deaf when we shoot 'em
And niggas on the floor with they cerebellum oozin'
Every homie I brand with them featured on Gangland
Ice picks in pencil pockets and nines on they waistbands
Money over bitches, we smother then we ditch 'em
I'll have 'em bag 'em up, butt-ass in the kitchen
I'mma leave bitches foamin' at the mouth
Fuck what you heard, it wasn't drought, they lied
Over here it's all the way gully
In the morning, answer to God's calling
Snoring, I can't afford to sleep, the cousin of death
The city never sleeps, so why the fuck would I rest?
It's all about the motherfuckin' 'jects, Lex Diamond's up next




Pull up, clap and distract you
Six cars away, yo, your brother in the back of the Ac'
I move pistols, hold 'em like infants
Jump out, rims, tints, guns is French, I can dent this
Out in Moscow Seagal style, look at the pair
Don't stare when the chain is a watchtower
We when we comin', ain't a Glock pulled
Rock the pyjama look
So now drama look like an eye-full
Coats Columbian with money in it
Ruthless Gotti, leather gloves on, the Wallies is blue body
Movin' through the dice game kickin'
Should have mittens on
Plottin' to dig in your pockets, we break niggas
Jumpin' in the A8's with swish men
Watches is Swiss, Chase Bank niggas
Drop you and then sprint
Don't ever dare walk in front of me
Cold as I wanna be
An old nigga who pump where the money be






Turn the track up a little bit
We need to rock in here

I wanna make you happy


I'm not at all happy or elated, this category ain't my favorite
It's my story, I'mma state it, you could love it or hate it
I'm just a misfit blessed with good dick and intelligence
Hood nigga holding no grudges on petty shit
I started, why are we cold-hearted, so guarded
Scared to get hurt, trying not to love the hardest
That's garbage, remember when we loved each other
Bathtub scrubbed each other, chillin', champagne spillin'
Uh, feelin' like the shit gon' last forever
Time went so fast, we had a blast together
Laughs we had, friends we spent time with
Now I be seeing your friends out, then I'm reminded
How we all used to gather up for the holidays
Now your friends all nervous to speak, they act afraid
I was your bestie, how it get to this
As I reminisce, takin' off my MJs in my empty crib
Mary...


I wanna make you happy
But you just don't see it
I wanna be around, babe
But I'm so tired of competing
We say all the wrong things
Till we make each other cry
What are we doing?
Will it ever get better?
My heart, my soul
I gave, it's yours
I can't get back
All the things that I lost
Boy, I love you
But you're pushing me away


I gave you everything that I got
Watched my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside


Now I was hoping
We'd get through this together
You said you'd love me
Through all types of stormy weather
Wasn't it you who said
We'd be together for all time
But it keeps messing with my mind
My heart, my soul
I gave, it's yours
I can't get back
All the things that I lost
I need you here near me
But I can't make you stay




I never thought that I would have this feeling
Do you think for once that you can truly mean it
Wasting so much time disagreeing
See, I'm to the point where I don't know what I believe in




If you don't want this, I don't want this, I do my morning crunches
Play my jazz, pray to the east, and watch the sunset
Uh, but yet I was blowin' you up the other night
Could tell your girl was telling you what to write back
Tell me why it's like that


So make up your mind, boy decide
We can't go on like this, this ain't right (it ain't right)
Feeling really bad, feeling kinda low
Think it's time to go






Haah !
Haah!
Yep

Yo, pass off, man
You know what it is, man
It's that shit, yo, Alchemist, what up?
Good looking


Ferry Boat killas, Park Hillas, infra red lasers
On the top of the ceilings, can't sneak by
Go downs is like blow hounds, we smother the block
Jumping in front of cars, lending niggas four pounds
Walk, keep it moving, yo, hop in the range
I know you real, cuz I raised you, not gon' front on your aim
We spit together, rocking wrist lights, stunting, right in front of
The parking lot
I'm like that shark wearing, lighting, been Niking
One bling, two bling no, only Boeings
And trips to Australia, yo, my niggas is smoke fiends
Fuck in every part of the planet, slam a forty with a salmon
Hit your ho on target, we family
These are big niggas, grown men, who travel the world
Calling global drug dealing niggas, moguls
Never locals, only courts I now is sober
And this is real nigga food, Chef giving out his soul food


Get a plate, man, for real, man
Come eat, man


Bulldogs they calling, phantom doors lift up, crawling
Kiss Shallah hand in the Holland
Larry and his guns is weird, six hundred onions a year
No more running, see the morgue, shorty
Wild nights, crew gunning cats, animal jackets and axes
Bulletproof buses, forty backs
Niggas is Romans, then turn around and they gon', then
Hoods is paro', niggas is logged in
Channel to channel, hammer to hammer
Rock a bandana knife like Rambo on the scrambler
Get high, trust your trigger man, logic is the bigger man
Get shit done, hit Orlando
New improved killas is beemer, plasma walls with the ninas
Stick your arm in the back, you jink
Thirty seven, three one five, eleven oh nine
With two T's, it's like rolling up new trees


Light up, man, light up, man
Open that nigga, I'mma blow ya, I'mma give ya a hundred, nigga
Just for that right there, my arm is...




Dressed in FILA, change in the beehive
7:30 nigga slick coupe with him, see ma?
I'm rich, my bitch, before and after, kept her well
Sit right there, enjoy the chapter
Bounce, 2 ounces get burnt
Thinkin' bread now, buy more lead, get the dread town
Let's smoke on the furlough king
Switch to Merlot, I know them niggas is bird, they swerve dope
Nobody gettin' it, whores is wicked with it
Little kids growin' up fast, teens is wickeded
No jobs, no checks, it's like rockin' an Olex
Rolex, her father is Cotex
Mother is so vexed, brothers is on X
Niggas is slummin' it, I'd rather see no necks
Dumb niggas, this the decade of bum niggas
It won't work, no matter how much bread you jerk


Inhale it (x3)
Weed so loud, all my neighbors say they hear it
Roll up the strong, inhale it (x3)
Weed so loud, all my neighbors say they hear it


I'm usually in the lawsuits frontin'
Comin' out Bank of America, big knot on me, I'm comfy
Roll the joints, jumpin' in joints, niggas with coins beat the point
And we want appointments, yo nigga, get some ointment
Stop playin', start prayin', I just might start sprayin'
Niggas is ass and all day with it
No style with no pals, niggas is so foul
It shows how I only fuck with real, them niggas know now
I slow down, don't wanna catch a charge and go down
I'm too large, drop a bag, use a marksman
Pause, said, "You don't want no parts of me, kid"
I'm just shootin' you real rap, so go wash with it
A legend with his hands up, suits is glammed up
I'm just bowlin' for millions out in Japan, what
Plannin' somethin', niggas ride around wearin' somethin'
Other than that or rap, I'd rather fade black




These niggas is dead already, I use machetes to eat spaghetti
They really couldn't ride a mile on my Pirellis
Bags so heavy the damns collapsed
Conversate about me, that's a chain reaction
Pressure to press in past aggression
Hope your body guard got pain protection
One in the chamber, middle finger, no fornicate
So many bullets in the clip, it's 'bout to sufficate
My uncle was late, my aunt ain't show up
How you gon' tell an old man to grow up
It's like comparin' Earl to throw up
Same frame of mind but a different poster
I'm 'posed to be what I wanna be
Dream so big for the world to see
First class, fruits and tea
And usually the only black man is me





(That's how the east side gets down, word up!)

(4:30 in the morning, mira
You know what I mean, mira
Let's get this money sorted and counted, word
Know what I mean, dame te culo mami
Give me my shit back, mira, hey yo
Fat Joe and them is here now, word
Shine like marbles, collects diamonds
The remix, add on son
Politic for the real ones...)


We get knots, like stockbrokers who own Marriotts
Blast shots for all my niggas who splash cops
The rich Corleone camp is here, thousand and one
Corner son, fake a jack, you be a goner....


Yo, control this rap like Napoleon
Half-Mongolian, hold it, you owe me in
Rock 'em like linolieum, yeah
Lex, diamonds, shin'in like you rhymin'
929'n, Titanium glass, time to play that ass
Whirlwinds of French, come movin' intense
Time to pull again, release the shell,well
Make 'em yell again, so sleek
But I'm a be maxin' in suites
Countin' your paper and countin' your sheeps
Hittin' your chick in Jeeps
Miraculously, attack your faculty, who wanna tackle me?
You jack mack, kidnap 'em for free
What?, you got heat, you better pop those
We movin' like gestapos, through underground potholes
That rock those, much land discoveries
Chrome rims, sippin' bubbly
Who livin' lovily, half a brick to cover me
So dissin' me, come on now listen G
You's a dime I'm a key
Thun, thun straight out of Sicily
Now, back to the stash crib
Joey Crack baggin' up cracks
One love, give 'em Jeep bags, Kid!


We get knots, like stockbrokers who own Marriotts
Blast shots for all my niggas who splash cops
The rich Corleone camp is here, thousand and one
Corner son, fake a jack, you be a goner....


Word ...life, I'll be the infamous
Who leaks the witnesses, crack's the wickedest
Run up in your crib, blast your kids
Ain't no myth in this, shit's official
I'll pistol-whip you with my Smith & Wesson
Cause my investin' was sendin rappers to heaven
Gives me an erection
You need protection from the smooth assassin
Who really moves at action, blastin' mothafuckas
Execution fashion
Now who's the fat one that you love to hate
Catch you at your mother's wake, smack you
Then I'll wack you with my snub 38
It doesn't take much to make me restless
Look at my face and definite lose your breath
Truck my face is Lexus
You want to test this, so really?
I'll make one call and have the whole WU comin' on the ferry
I'm very dangerous and well-connected
I puff an L with Method, then try to
Decide who's next to fill his neck slit
So respected and admired the boss, retired your lost
Wu Tang, your terror squad, vaya con Dios!


We get knots, like stockbrokers who own Marriotts
Blast shots for all my niggas who splash cops
The rich Corleone camp is here, thousand and one
Corner son, fake a jack, you be a goner....


You guys despise guys like us
Guys like us, disgust like Spartacus
You cuss and claim a bust
You lust for a part of us, you thrust
But can't touch
Plus we far from any type of fellas you can trust
Put the pressure on the mic, I biz
Press to your chest, sound like sweat on my back
We're having sex, tight-ass flex
Pretty Pocahontas pussy sweet, like my new Tek
Sis' got curves like a GS, 300 Lex
My body's 95% alcohol, 5% cancer
Sosa diamonds, Getty, Lucci, blaze it up like Bonanza
Catch me in the cut, easy G's is burnin' my gut
As I Remember my menage au trois was mired by sluts
I questionmark your heart, punctuate your fate
All your version predicates
Done as well as you pronunciate
In the (west)?,we're gonna break you off the isle
Take C.O.s hostage arab style, no surrender


We get knots, like stockbrokers who own Marriotts
Blast shots for all my niggas who splash cops
The rich Corleone camp is here, thousand and one
Corner son, fake a jack, you be a goner....


Yo, I'm all about business and enterprisin'
Advisin' financial advisors on franchisin' to widen their horizons
Divisin' ideas with masterminders
Movin' on a stash of diamonds
First we get the cash, then we laugh like miners
Don't get me wrong I'm a funny bastard
But when it come to money, dunn, I'm not the one to laugh with
I'm after for what, cash can bring me brothers
Me and my demon lovers blast and laugh at hyenas
Back to Ringling Brothers believe them others
You'se the best, yet, and still
I'm investin' mils on a hunch over lunch
Puffin' on a Chesterfield, who wants to test
The real scandalous?
I'm at the Sands in Los Angeles
Plannin' hits with an ananymous philanthropist
Spanish kids, close to God, like evangelists
Choppin' niggas up and makin' sandwiches....

Big shout to my man Raekwon, word is bond




These are the men who lead the crime families of America
I control 26,000 men
Except for dope, we operate in all aspects of organized crime. And if there's one thing I'm sure of
It's that drugs destroy your mind and destroy your home
In the end it'll only lead our country into ruin


We eat fish, toss salads and make rap ballads
The biochemical slanglord'll throw the Arabs
In the dope fiend, vocal chords switch laser beams
My triple sevens broke the slot machines out in Queens
Grey Poupon is Revlon rap, smack pawns, swing like batons
Most my niggas smoke like Hillshire Farms
Check the gummy sole, underneath my shoe lies the tap
That attract bow-legged bitches with wide horse gaps
In steel mills Iron he'll smoke the blow on duns
You run errands, Primatene Mist is afraid of my lungs
Turn my channel, it'll blow your whole bench off the panel
Like eighty roman candles that backfired then slammed you
Every day is like a video shoot, check this shit
I take it back to Playboy, stash guns in whips
Picture afro picks, shish kabobs and dashikis
Thousands civil marched, raised their fists in early sixties


Now check this one, you must have been stupid to miss this one
Donna shogun-ing flip a ton of fashion
Destination be the cash one, I step past one
Don't make me blast one, I'm cold like Eskimo floe
Cappa villain stay chilling take shots of penicillin
Clean out and let the steam out, she fiend to blow out
But I'm equipped with mad white, Morris The Rap got nine lives
I'll take a few hundred thousand dollar dives
And then I still never go down
Until the last round I shine
When RZA do his thing motherfucker, I'mma do mine


Now, where I come from cats be carrying, marrying drug money
Fuck up your wife, get four to life
Cream we handling, Midtown niggas scrambling
Move and examine the fly shit, plus quick to buy shit
Chef, yeah, you know the whole gods astral
Fidel Castro suits plus depositing cash rule
Big time, play it like Canadian wine
RZA's divine now, the sacredness of one's true mind
Now let's get colorful like money green
High roller coaster, Sosa, million dollar nigga roaster
Yeah God, be having my whole steez laced
Now let's rap a taste, connect dots, aim Glocks, train stop
Figaro fly jeweling, tri-color Cubans
Swerving with power Germans and Suburbans
Twenty-four niggas with vests on, my own restaurant
Dons sending my sons membership forms
And still getting this paper scraper
Fake gators from Jamaica, wizzes be passing like Lakers
And it be coming from Lex Louis Rich Liberace
Fetus style and blocking goals like hockey




Dare one of ya'll niggas get out of line, I'mma finalize
Ziplock your face, plus do the time
See my niggas, cook square denny's, we the tea sippers
Need liquors, off the hook, yo, we them niggas


We on the block, man, we keep 'em cocked, man
And what's going on right here, ya'll can't stop, man
You'll get popped, man, you better believe that, Where's the weed at?


Aiyo, caught me by the bodega, I flossy, saucy
In viesel jeans, pockets had the measles, gleen costly
A hundred on the wrist, glist Rothstein
Glad to meet you, his boo said I eat you, just a portion of me
Leather plush, burberry sweater with the furry gloves
With the trims on, the grin on
Looking mad hungry, but my beard chunky
What's happening, you black? No question, what you offering me?
Seventeen five a banana, grab a chair
Rapping like we at the Copacabana, niggas scared
The shorty working the arms, the sister's like two big magic wands
She shook her ass in the magic thongs
She recognizing I'm no average don
She seeing me posing, extra live with my karats on
Stop, tilt the glass on 'em
Half past a mill, was worth like a half a mill in cash, on






Yo Game what up, (Yo Chef what it is)
Ain't nothing my nigga, tryna get paid in full man
(You know I'm definitely down for that)
So you reppin' Black Wall Street right
(Black Wall Street general, five star soldier and all that)
No question I'm reppin' Vatican, we gone do this big nigga style
Let's take em there for real, let's go


Before flusty days living in Killa Hills
I was young'd out with rusty waves
Cut'n hair chill'n, going down town blaze'n
Lay'n up in Albee Square, when I bought my first fronts there
Everybody young as fuck, in the pizza shop, What up
Brooklyn niggas rap with a cuffle
Call the highlights the gangsta dialect
Before I let any nigga take mine I'm die'n, Moet
What's the jump off, the new shit
Then he said hold up a sec
Get this crack money, niggas except
Wick checks, food stamps and amps
Blue Wallabee's, aviaries on in the back on the ramp
You know we pop off for hours, cowards beware
Word to Mother, you gone respect my power
Respect the dollar, no quizzy, get busy
It was like adolescents at war, we clapped them thizzies
On the duece suited Voltron, the ratchet heavy
In the crib coolin' blunted, watchin' Tom & Jerry
Bagin' up, laughin', blingin', rhymin' and singin'
When it come to getting currency, call me a swinger
We rock Maybach's, Benz's is little
Icicles on, cover the ground with a massive dribble
Call us ballers, brawlers, them whores want all us
Suede down, coolin', playin' spades with quarters
And then left it for the rap game
All my niggas grab champagne
Bust of them seals it's mad flames, ya'll lames
Stay in your lane, we movin' like big money
Bet a nigga die for them chains
You know the slang baby, watch me lay her
Half goon, half mayor, the other half call me a hater
But later, I'mma polly for Rae-ah, and a hundred wolves
Pull next time, respect the playa, what


Flashbacks, memories, two shots of Hennessy
Street life etiquette, real niggas blend with me
Talking bout ten a key, Baltimore, Tennessee
I ain't got to tell you, how long I been a G


I'm sick and that drop Aston is the medicine
Ridin' with the Moon in the rear view, it's only evident
I'm fly as the wings on a seven forty-seven jet
Game code his rhymes, ain't even been recorded yet
On the fence where my Father used to sport a Vet
And my Uncle Red ran the rock like door set
Rewind time ten years before I had the Lex
Mail man scared to drop the bills on my door step
Little nigga street dreamin' bout a fast car
My Father had dope tracks like his arm was Nascar
In eighty-seven, shit I was maybe seven
Watchin' my big brother throwin' ten, come back with eleven
Only knew what it was cause I overheard
My Pops on the phone talking bout selling all my birds
I cried over the next eight years over them pigeons
To only find out not one was missing, word




Yeah, that's how we do what we do, knahmsayin?
For real, the only thing we do baby
Is fold dough, you heard
And read the DuPont all day nigga
And get the stove clean you heard
This is real offical shit man, word up man
Our cherry is different from all these
Phony ass, carrot cake ass niggas
Fake ice philanthropist, you know what the fuck I mean nigga
Ha ha, it's real niggas right here boy
Word up, go buy the babies them big bangin'
Am & Barshon necklaces, bothing but new luggage nigga
Y'knahmsayin, catch me in the South of France nigga
Clean as a fuck, that's how it go
Yeah, this is powerful shit baby, word up
Black Wall Street, Vatican, BT man, what up baby




Ever since I was 13, my biggest problem has been just to find the right road to get to that rainbow that everybody talks about
Like most people get close enough to count the stripes
But they don't have enough guts to reach out and take that pot of gold

What up my dude, you know
Going through a lot and all that man
That's why you be strong, you know what I'm saying
Feel great boy (Staten Island over yeah)
It's going now ()
Holla at the kid
(Let's go chef)


I'm flawless, the gowns that I rock is cashmere
Then roam through the lab with the hammer and black Airs
Thinking 'bout plans that's real, laying the bill
Drop a new classic album, my masters will
Enlighten your mind, I'm writing on times
When the youth reach real situations and they thoughts are blind
You know when I float a moment is fine, glass of wine
New elegance, the greeze just pass through the mind again
What happened, rap made it happen, back when
Two turn tables and a needle, action
We all huddled up, that's it, classic shit
Only our kind adapt to shit
Start rapping 'bout cracks and Pimps, cash to get
Call it C.R.E.A.M. now, no grind don't ask for shit
We bastard thick, pass the spliff


Name of this piece is called "my bitch better have my money" (applause)
My bitch better have my money, through rain, sleet or snow
My ho better have my money
Not half, not some, but all my chash
Because if she don't, I'mma put my foot in her ass




Uh... lay back.. word up, just bless 'em
With the bulletproof... more cases for ya eyes...


Flawless crowns, sevens, bags of black
We kill industry niggas and build maps
High powered money, blimps with emblems
Pimps, all of my hoes'll spray you under the tints
Yeah, car shows with cases, writing niggas out in the Beacon
Down in the antics, Lex, you should take it
Wide world of sniffers, spiroglyphics, caesers and blue eagles
I'mma make my music the business
And now for the record, I'm on niggas, go head, ditech it
I'mma leave you left, freezing and naked
Silverback gorillas, taught to bite tongues out faces
Fleeing in clubs, fly in something silver
Catch me with the Germans, hard body dealing with hard white
Dominican complexion with some hard ice
Can't nothing rock me, I'm legendary


What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what
It's on you bitch... word up...
Back to that ice rocking shit
The muthafuckin' good sneakers on
With the persian muthafuckin' scarfs hanging on
Catch me flying in that muthafuckin' XO
It's on, with the shit on the other side
The steering wheel on the other side, my nigga
You know what it is, it's going down
Cuban Linx man, Part 2, The Purple Tape
It's on, thoro, do it...




See me in the club, got a gun on my leg
Select paper and invade all the illest niggas tally up paid, yo
Live Crew meeting, laying in the lab with robes of fly Mo
We hold all niggas eating
Racquetball gangsters, unleash the law straight up
Colorful drawers, bad whores on the weekend
Eat it raw style like Flounder
Fucking with mine or how we design my niggas might find ya
Laying in the Tropics, big dick shit on park
The way his Clarks look, niggas on topics
Moving out, coloured Durangos, picture me broke
That's like picture rich niggas with the same coats
Or rich niggas with the same coke


You can catch us cruising, balling a ship, fully equipped
On a StarTAC, calling a bitch, I'm what you get
When that Absolut and Hennessy mix (Ultimate! Ultimate!)
Wu shit, my whole click (Ultimate! Ultimate!)
Rub-a-dub, ass in the club, showing me love
Saying Peace to the nigga that thug, I got the drugs
And the .38, snub-nose, striking a pose
Baby girl spilled her drink on my clothes, the new Girbauds
Louis Rich, Hot Nikks, nigga what's happening?
Ain't shit, holding my dick, smoking a clip, thanks for asking
Mashing, the latest fashion
Dance floor packed in, whites, blacks and latins
All in together, together for worse or better
Now I put it down whether it's Methy, Method, or Meth-Tical
Rock, skate, roll, bounce
I'm bound to wreck your body as they turn the party out


All magazines lay fly life we live
The lingo was to let y'all niggas know how niggas rep
I'm set lighting the Purple in a new Lex
Trifling work, let's murder everything that move on the set


I better pay Big Mama for using his lyrics


And my mouth stay dry cos I swallow the struggle
I might connect you to a VCR after they plug you
I'm not a gangster and I hate thugs too
I'm just a nigga that paint a picture without a paintbrush too
Without a paintbrush too


Bulletproof Wallets, 20 G kitchens sets made out of Korea
Top Sear, gots to be a lots to see a rocks
Knots we re'd up behind the stove asking how Maria popped Lea
Cursed out Nia, burst out her purse
With the gods you jeer from Star's Pizzeria
Peace hate to be ya, especially when them shots ring off
In slow motion when yo' head hit the meter
You lost two liters, at the same case speeder
Peter slid through shook 'em down for his reefer
James chased Theresa with a hatchet on Easter
Two murders in the hood, we call it double features
Watch how I eat this, freak the best teacher
After prayer with the preacher, I get skied in the bleachers
And your girl, I might eat her
I'm a lover, not a biter
I still catch her for a pizza


You can be as good as the rest of 'em or as bad as the worst
So don't hate me, you better move over yeah!


You fucking idiots!
Wallets motherfucker!
All my shit is bulletproof
Bulletproof projects, bulletproof wallets
R.A.G.U., you heard, you bird-ass niggas
Y'all niggas ain't got a chance




Selling glass and blasting, machinery sling past
Next stop: Bowling Green, bling flashing
Glow my ass off, Po-Po they try to harass
My dough - ching cash - and I sit in my dash and vent
You know the W that come from Dirty Bast
Bird baths, love to stunt, we got birds with gats
Fly past, buy NASA, caught up with the cash
Why blast when you know we in your crib? Bypass
I mastered what? The treasurer of getting ass
Whip assing, red pipe and leather; slick nasty
Sassy, but at the same time raspy
Plug me a thug, your mother eating plaster

Yeah, yeah, straight outta jail
First time nailing me, realer than the obvious
They never said it was gonna be easy
Who can y'all put up with?
The streets... why you coming at me like that, man?
You payin' him? You taking care of me?
What's the matter with you, man?
See this the shit that make a nigga don't come over, man


Aiyo, fly shorty Penelope, fresh female chick
Straight outta jail, first time mailing me, God
Realer than the obvious, livelyness was on the line
I mean like, the sweetest thing, most seen her kind


Bloomingdale patient, slick finance who got a Benz station
Studying law, buying North Faces
Tried by the police, yo, straight up and down
I hold rollies, size six shaconies, daughter, might name her Water
Son, might name him Rich Porter, style, Law &  Order
Copped them quarters, it's real, blowing out in Florida
Displaying a game, frame, I'm adoring her
Blasting music, I'mma lose it, shorty romance the music
Just grind, don't dance to it, flexin' with a sun dress on
Shorty refreshin', less you stressed, stop swarmin' on her
Yellin', it's all made basic, taste it
Anybody lace this here, you can blaze it
Rinaldo stepped up, what, "Lex, you know I got it lined up"
Bust ya gun from the side, what?
Take this thought in mound, your frame might be a dime
But the brain power might not shine
Shorty had a good head once, rolling up blunts, damn
She fucked up, got caught in the crunch
Now, down go her lifestyle
She on the FDR now, with a Audi J, bugging out
Stop that drinking, you wild, project chick, yo
Won't even tuck her chain, nigga, that's foul
Got caught up in the number run, dunn
I need to get my life back, son, share one
Lex laid it out, but she stunt, enter and still smoke blunts
Shit ain't real, she yelling "Fuck everyone"
Yup, caught up in the midst, I mean glitz
Went from doorags to rich, now he blue hat and switch
I guess, the live way to rap it, shorty went backwards
Now she stuck with a dirty Guess jacket
Keep on, giving out the jewels wrong
Who wrong? Who want? Who trynna-trynna act like you never knew wrong
Now it's raining, now I'm maintining, gaining
Probably gaming with positive aiming, long dane it
Stepped in, jumped in the car, fuck God
Put the Wisdom for Knowledge, you bond, whine too hard
Shaking her ass, walking out to the garage, you large
Fuck men, fuck who weighing nods
Stopped, took a peak at the stars, the Zodiac, a fine Mars
Or lose it for a chick behind bars
Wash, waking up Lars, aiyo collect call Taj'
Let's take a half a million in the cards
Laying up, at the Laborage, say I need a massage
Stressed, jumping out the Guess jumper, charged
Wifey material, make sure y'all observe the ariel
I'm mailing this through ya stereo
Wifey material, make sure y'all observe the ariel
I'm mailing this through ya stereo
Wifey material, make sure y'all observe the ariel
I'm mailing this through ya stereo



This the story of Osama
Allahu akbar in Uganda
Niggas put me on to the drama
Now sit back a song with the data
A boy from Saudi Arabia who had it made
But he hated the fortune glamour the fame the game
An Oxford graduated, rather see the sun when it rain
He studied economics, Islamic, drink tonic, hate chronic
Didn't hate america he hated the congress
Old daddy die when he was ten and he's powerful man
Who had paper slinging oil and men
Wealthy religious and educated ayo this made lots of bread
Family been 
Three wifes at seventeen
Now it gets better as team
Yeah it's time to form the mujahideen
Warhead religion for the muslims by any means
Reminds me of Farrakhan Malcolm and King
Play boss who had driving for show
His clans was well written
So the kid slid to Sudan
Had a couple vans some land
Few good religious brothers did all his prayers with him
Giving him grants
It was Afghanistan he had training can't smash
Jumping out of 
Fly turbans suburbans sands 
Jumping off the camels eating turkey and lamp
Blood brothers holy warriors the others wore cover
Fuck by injury let's explore bring the luggage
They shot the terror board with no order
300 degrees out one glass a water for four of us
Drink brother these are them crusaders
Who slide through the Mid East  back to the border
There's some  now it's war
A global terror in your area US calling it dogs
Bush with his regime against mujahideen suicide bombers versus the marines
Al Qaeda was skin nerve gas anthrax thrown on the scene
Taliban coming martyrly

My mind drifts now and then
Lookin' down dark corridors and wonders what might have been
Something's up ahead
Hey, should I keep this same direction or go back instead?


Honey, now lets stop walkin' around
When there's love lost to be found
And you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense in goin' elsewhere?

Who feels really sure?
Can that feelin' guarantee your happiness shall endure?
And do we, really care? Hey, hey
Let's look at what's been happenin' and try to be more aware


Yeah, lets stop walkin' around
Well when there's love lost, lost to be found
Honey, you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense in goin', goin' elsewhere?

Honey, lets stop walkin' around and around and around
When there's no love to be found
Baby, you know, I still care, I still care
What's the sense of goin', goin' elsewhere?

Chunking with the hustlers then next with the credits

You up in the parks while a nigga shoots
Before you tell them salute you from the male
When master of the music is like addicate
Before you get played you better choosing who is your manager
My handguns are charging come to the complex
And hang around the cons in the convent

Elevate my niggers work with me yeah
Orange check generals on deck

Ain't nothing changed but the game




I'm your highness, your highest title, numero uno
Putos, they clone  like Naruto
Your man super, grand groover on that Sambuca
Mass mover, automatic rap Ruger
Clap back, I bleed for my brother
You know, the wolves stay fed cause they feed on each other
I got a G for a mother
Cynthia's son, take the game like three at the buzzer
Harder than the prison wall, hitting y'all all
Up in critical condition it's official when my clique involved
Listen y'all, Sir I certified
Anything other than the facts are falsified
They idolize I, well i know wise guys, leave em eyes wide
Inside the gravel pit, spitting cyanide
Darts flash, hot enough to warp glass
When the shark pass, piranhas park 


I'm kinda swole, cause everything I want I got made
I never feared, got everything from choppers to blades
They gave me rags and all of them they knew I want haze
When I was spliffing that night, me and the  with K's
Some kids across town thought I was amazed
Knew I was fronting, I had the army in range
It's most of us popping pains, selling drugs in the rain
Trynna make money, maintain and build me a train
Deal with facts only, no slang, that's only for dames
We will run up in the building tags and niggas with chains
Rocking range, lock and aim, take your sneakers and chain
Leave em snubbed, outta luck, you shoulda bought you your flames
But you didn't, this could happen to a king or a queen
Be on point next time and don't be bringing no lames
Cause if you fuck up the next time it might make you famous
Might bump into a gunman who only want brains and shit


I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
I get the cash, see money over tricks and
But keep a snow bunny in the kitchen
The hood still love cause I'm different, see that's the difference
I talk greasy, my hands greasy, that's the chicken
It's that easy, my flow phat cause I'm that greedy
You got to feed me in stacks, what up to Crakk Peedi
State property, racially profiled
State trooper stopping me, I'm low down
Dirty it's a shame, I should slow down
Kick off my shoes, put my coat down
Separate the oil from the coke now
Pennies I got plenty and I still want more
Kinda like a Beamer '35 I still want four
85% still don't know
That is a hundred percent and y'all rappers tryna steal my flow


I got a name from everything from con to Sway
I got my row stitched up by a Colombian name
I got a crack spot, a G5 I never flown
I got a shark, a dog with a solid gold bone
I even copped me a piece of mind up in the Buddhist mountains
I don't sweat money, I got ten accountants
With fly bitches butt naked in Bermuda
And buddha, ice cooler, Grey Goose and big Ruger
The fact is, I pose for low in Gazelle glasses
The booth Ted Dibiase just tripled the carats
And you can tell by the style I choose
I'm creatively superior, I rhyme over the blues
Never lose, never lost,  of the frost
I got a whole clan and Tonetana's the boss
I get paid when my record is played
To put it short: I got it made




Get it!
Haha, Funk Doc in the building, bitch
Ya'll already know the business, nigga, haha


Yo, let's get it, yeah, I'm with it
Streets on fire, I'm frying my dinner
Quick like Sugar Ray Leonard, one love
Any boy get served like tennis
Menace, you call a rap bulldog
Me and my pen form into Voltron
Cold, my heart built with a snowball
And I fuck old women like Zohan
Roll on like Mitchum
Barry Bonds this bitch when the beat start pitching
I'm broke, my ATM ain't kicking
But what I drive, I build expensive
Look at me, nigga, I got it
In pocket, ask Houston how I 'rock-it'
If I go hungry, you getting robbed
By me, Biggie Smalls and The Delfonics


Yo, man, yeah, yeah, take it back to Rae shit
Straight off the muthafucking concrete, nigga
You know how I go, word up, let's go
{Three minutes left...}


Before all the cussing and the gunfights
Don't wanna run Nikes, yeah, scramble when it sunlight
G's in my pocket of juice, blue goose
I'm a goon under the moon, glow on the boosters
Yeah, deadily my sons regret me
Windpipe writing, the mic fighting, respect me
I'm from where it get down, machete your mother
Snatch your brother, scrap you down
You know the deal, when we do this, chill
Catch me in Brazil, ratchet on, little glass of Tequil'
I sware to the real, my real, if I don't win
Then I won't spend, I'm grabbing bill
That's the hammer, I'mma do this, nana
Niggas who hunt, snatch 'em up, bite the clip, the banana
And this is for them good niggas, blow that L
And that blow that well, and watch the book, niggas


Yeah, watch them jooks, niggas, you know what it be, man
Word up, niggas staying alive (Gotta kill these voices in my head)
{Two minutes left} Bunch of fucking roaches, man


Jeter, married to the game without a pre-nub
And she don't act up, if I don't eat her
Damn, now that's what I call a diva
You sick, man? I'm what you call a fever
And I don't put no snow up in my cheeba
Pack a little heater, the game get colder in the freezer
Hit your little corner with the sweeper
Dance with the reaper, sharper than a fuck
Plus I'm laying in the cut like a half-moon Caeser
What you getting is the truth
My bird eye visions spot the pigeon in the coup
Same way I live it, how I spit it in the booth
Next to RZA, ain't no nigga bigger than the group
Stat, fuck that, we come strapped
Bust gats, drug raps, and pump cracks
What you trying do nigga, we done done that
I'm off the gunrack, nigga put ya gun back


Yeah, you slow your blow, boy
You gon' lay where you lie, nigga
(Get rid of the crack, and flush that dust
Hurry, where the L, move, come on, freeze, freeze)
{One minute left}


Aiyo, I woke up in handcuffs, heard the police wanted me dead
Big bullets and splashing all over
Kingpin's still moving that weight
And his main goon burned up a discotech
He's a hazard, classic, nigga, we got a flick of him
He jacked Nate, while he took the picture
And we tapped his crib, bugs all in the jacuzzi
Under the seeds bed, we found an uzi
Trully, and we know about his bitch in Charlotte
Pulled her over, State Troopers found two revolvers
And she told us them handguns "That's my fathers
And I'm licensed to carry those shits regardless
Ya'll just played my man, caught her with a million dollars
Worth of fireworks, coming back from Japan
It's nothing, ya'll police be fronting
And stop looking at my pussy, like ya'll want to suck it, I'm out
On ya'll pussies, catch me next time, bye bye"


Alright, fellas stand back and watch the closing doors
Lock 'em up! Let's go, lights out

How you like it baby? I like it on the sink
You freak me, butt-naked in a long mink
Yo, I like my power-U warm, study Islam

Stab meat like knives, I'm tranqued by your chinky eyes
You're razor baby, this a stick up, throw your legs up
You fake freak in the morning cuz at midnight, you gave up
You had me harder than a roll of quarters
You felt the snake-head, you can't cook, you can't fuck

In the categories of stories I breed my sequel

Monkey see, monkey do shorty sipping sunny dew

Big Havoc at like you know, kid




Kid, you don't know me, you don't wanna know me
You tried to blow me your weak side just showed me
Stepped out my door on 41st Side at 12,
Didn't see my crew around so I got bent for search
I had to jet back upstairs so I can stash my 9
It was a Friday night Rikers had it bad one time
Cause niggas getting bagged on a regular son
D's like "Fuck the drugs, all we want is the guns,"
So I proceed with caution, eyes open whenever walking
Niggas be ass talking then be victims of extortion
Hold myself down the only way I know
Niggas pumping back in streets, in debt cause they owe
Street life is like a trial, ass out if you blow
The maximum is death son you know how that go



Yo where this nigga at man

Verse 1:

Yo up in the game room 4 in the morning
And it's storming and we blitzed
Just rocked another wig yeah we on it
God had blood on his sweat pants
The way the tech dance
On a nigga face
Son ain't have a chance
Seen him high pitch yellow nigga
]From outta town a young mellow ally
Trying to run through
Hell, it's on called the dogs to get on him
And we caught him, only thing this nigga
Was a lord in his forearm
Bum nigga fresh outta jail
I used to play baseball with him
'Til son got large--bought a whale
Azure by the entrance
Guess it's real nigga night out
He moving on his own negligence
Yo Lexxy strap up meet you in the back
In the Acura, spectacular vic, he stackular
Seen a nigga gem-down, fresh haircut
Trying to swim now
Aqua green Avias on brim style wild
We walked by eyeing 'im
Shorty ain't looked
He trying to get fly
My niggas ain't dived on him
Kaze had the Mac in the vest
The way he moving might be dressed
He made two rights nigga move left
Standing by the incinerator
Thank God he a generator
I can tell, bought his lady suede gators
Yo now it's time to move
Spin nozzles on the tools
Might just bust him quiet style rules
He walked out the crib, yup draped
We on the elevator baked
Staring at the nigga chain shape
We looked at him, seen all crooked
Then we flashed on him
He knew we was live
My man Boo spazzed on him
Pulled out, take off the wool
Nigga cool out
Walk you out the bulding
Betta run nigga move out
This nigga liver than fuck
Larger than fuck betta kill me
All y'all niggas is butt
What spray it up
Tuck the chains in
Kaze shot him at point blank range then
He started screaming like a cave man
Blood got a salty taste, I can tell
Furniture fell out his face
Laced now it's a case
Threw up, vomit on my coat piece
Snatched all his ice now
Chrome T, boatin' off low-key
Didn't know the kid was large
Hour later call from jail
Mexicans surrounding the Gods
Chill you bigga than the ocean
Slow motion play it off no emotion
But my man in there grossing
What to do they might kill him
We might kill you circulate death
That's how the real do
We sat there 3 live macks of the year
Crack beers one nigga in the back
Washing off his track Airs
Don't take it serious
Vivid flow luxurious
I'm hearing this'll
Make a real nigga curious
Friday my day, chill Pop
Leave 'em on the highway
Bet he won't never fly my way




From the Hill to the Shaolin
All the rules that came, from foreign part
From the Hills, of the Shaolin
With an iron fist of fury and the mighty sword
To fulfill the prophecy of the Wu-Tang, of the Wu-Tang


In the Polo store, fronting in war clothes, it been like this
From right in time when I was nine years old
I was a hot mess, smoking cheeba, running with stolen speakers
Dropped beepers, even wore a victory vest
I run with niggas, digging knots from niggas, running out the school
Stunting, back of the bus, flashing the ox
Rock the V-Gooses, everything we wore was name brand
Sold three lucy's, just to get on call plan
R.E.C. Poss' Rockers, the Blip Brothers
Even the Spin Doctors, sat and smoke blunts, I been bopping
All my kins blew up, we grew up with
We used to do what? Running through the sewers and then shopping
Pick pocket, deuce baby, take it in truce, baby
You know how we do, come run in my boots, baby
The niggas came through, touch the God, here Shallah
Ever since went from ninjas to gem stars, sing Rah




Reunited, another LP, we're all excited
That wreckless eyeballing'll get your girl indicted
My touch like Midas, I cramp your style, arthritis
These niggas is food, I eat they food, nigga-ritis
Your man don't snooze, insomniac
This The W, the Clan don't lose, you putting hands on who?
Hands down, I can handle you, you half man, half animals
If you are what you eat, and eat pussy, you'se a cannibal
And stopping me, is what you can not do
Either get in the game, get out the way, or get ran right through
I ain't different Method Man like you
But you ain't like us, we play rough, my community tough
And little kids in my community cuss
Ya'll be showing your guns, but the ones in my community bust
And when they do, you get a jewel re-up





"How can I forget you" 4x


Rick the Ruler, Raekwon, hehe the Chef, check one two


Touch more, taste a glass of oil
Flash yours Rick
Money we saw, left em dead on the door, dick
Rocks look chunky on the index
Straight up, Lee vets and like old Adidas sweats
We the the illest vets


Apologies, even a non-dog holler "he's honor"
Please, appreciate shit I clog Wallabee's
Brothas wit they fists like oaks wood
Provokes doom, and you're also about to go broke soon


Mad current merchants, we nursed it
Bad guerillas, feed us like guaranteed they gon' kill us
Fleeing, ninety in a night suit, G-ing white dudes
Hit the locks first, we made a right troop


I'm lushin Russian women, via satelite I'm watchin
I dare a nigga say he wanna battle me, I'll crush ya
Even blind girls rush next to Hammera and scream out
"Oh my gosh, get the camera"

Chorus
Yo we frozen, lay on the bount now, we a day on
Ill niggas yellin "Throw Rick and Rae on"
Hydro, how did I blow, how did I flow
Did I glow, let them niggas know


(Yo)
Rap wars commence and they kids cause offense
I don't have to say a word and your bitch-drawers are drenched
Didn't say I was gonna murder the fella
But The Ruler got some shit the could stop a herd of gorillas


Stressed wit Hollywood hoes, actin up
Backin up, what? This yours, what?
Crawlin in the cut, we lee major
Gems on wit Timbs, brims on drawn to lay you up
Layin in the day wit what?


Next pull up CEO wit bank books full up
Even though he's overwhelmed, this nigga Rolls Royce pull up
One of the baddest come, noddin to a Spanish song
Slung, orange woolridge park and a Savannah pump


Severe teaspoons, scary money on the moon
Lampin wit a big goon, keep shit tight like a kid's room
Big Bird in the driveway, bullet out Friday
I'm liver that way, I ride only the fly way
Olive-green thinkin, ship sinkin
Deep-dish thinkin, big fish tank, wrist full of Franklins
This mock-neck, shark-skin money
Eighty-eight, summer reader dun ?dummeries?
Rock dungarees


Punctures his lung, son says "I don't want this"
Even this so-so beat I make monstrous
Lady cops stake to watch pair hoods
"Freeze, you're under arrest, you look mad good"
Hot and don't fret retard who won't let the new sherifs in town
What part you don't get?
Rick and Rae, and now restoring the passion
The fashion, the class, I went to work on your ass

Chorus 2x




Yo, yo, yo, yo
Fuck you

What you wanna be when you grow up
You wanna be thugs
You wanna be pranksters
You wanna sell drugs

That's what silly boys are made of


A-yo; a-yo; Coogies and forty seven flavors
Display swade gators
We coming through to blaze neighbors
Meet mark and pardon me to heat mark
A dutch spark it, Lex Leonardo arts profit
Apple cranberry mixed with Cristal, fan worry
Desert mountain crib in the ground, we arsonists
One point five a liter, take a taste, splash your heater
Smack your face twice, clap your sneakers
Shit is like a mission to Mars, fishing for bars
Taking what's ours, knowledge the car pa
Don't be stupid, get a little cash better swoop it
Throw it in the ground and recoup it
Next check was best, your family pack your shit
Get vexed, leave a nigga standing in a bag of leaves
Some niggas catch on later
Try to put them on they haters
I met eighty of them niggas yo
Waiting on the sidelines drooling
Some need schooling
Let me teach yo and roll a student what
Rule one: yo respect if you lose son
Don't be big back about to learn to move dunn
All hell to niggas in jails
With sharks in they fishtanks
Now he come home he a whale
Wolves in the projo's, projo's yo
We realer up in my shows yo
Middle finger five-ohs
Take time to climb vines yo
Lay on the lines like Laury only loving Rae kind
Sun splash cash layign like three bags of hash
Fully wrapped in a Indian man's stash

 (x2)
A-yo; what you wanna be when you grow up
You wanna be thugs
You wanna be pranksters
You wanna sell drugs
You wanna be gangsters
That's what silly boys are made of


A-yo, get up, Lex should be bragging
Get it up, fuck shorty got cream in a mean truck
Prop-ness she holler like the Loch Ness
He large rock this, fresh Ferrari in a drop six
Fro's; yo talking about the dough on his clothes
Glaze is crushed up poking on rolls yo
Oh yeah and maybe getting cream
See what I mean black queen stop actin' like crack fiends and
Brawl we wanna thank all of y'all
Play the wall hype checking how this lady walks stay hawking
Grab the remain, divorce (uh)
Shame came to yours, we like green
Rock the same game plan, ours (Yo, Yo)


Ladies and gentlemen, you're about to see
A pastime hobby about to be
Taking to the next degree
By M-E-TH and the bloody Chef Boyardee
Watch out bitches is too nosey
Backhand slapping the phoney
Got to walk it off can't mosey
Who got you open up
Crack pipe still smoking, face frozen
Coke straw sticking out your nose and D
Proposing that you bleed on the Chef apron
My thing hold down the play-pen
And say the nursery rhymes they making
Come on now, shit's too real
Fuck you and now your man feel
Time don't stand still for y'all bitches
Wanna Big Ball, I got two for you to juggle in your jizzals
I'm losing it now, throw in the pieces like a jig-saw

On tracks we connect, politic ditto, take that to that

 (x2)
A-yo; what you wanna be when you grow up
You wanna be thugs

You wanna sell drugs

That's why we both stand here




Feeling like a Tyrone Jones, barefoot on the block
Going gorilla, hip or hop out close
I'm #winning with no Charlie on me
Feeling like a cool Billy, these gates, they never close
Backstage chilling with women who kiss my hiney
At the back of the club, sipping Moet is where you'll find me
Bumping Al Green through alpines
Full of fire, toking on Cheese C99
My Cinderella high times, my, how time flies
Whenever I deny strife, live out my life
Without living a lie, like figures that I find ridiculous
My life's live, nigga, go Popeye for spinaches
I'm spinnin' kids, no stop time
We diligently killing it, OGs chillin', they feelin' it
Cause we the realest in the building, Ciroc'king luxurious
Bottles popping, I'mma Rick James, the party don't stop


Gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta


Crow teeth, words and writing
All I know is bloodsport, Gilette-style, lyrics are slicings
Started from the bottom, now I got em
Slip us in the motion, two big bulls, my hoes riding
Water to grass, thinking 'bout cash
Buy an ass stack out, cop a couple giraffes
Yo, ranch house, twelve rooms, I play the largest, the top
Anywhere else, I'm all for my blocka
Killers with connects, specs on
Adidas' sweats, gold MAC-11s, reapers and creps
We showing, chill out, relax fully
My game plan is Ray Man, 300 million, all stacks, really
Dumb bishes, this the division
Yo, far away from prison but I'm still in the system
Can't take it? Roll out, it's like the dice
So nice, birthday cakes with bombs and they blow out






Scratches


To be here, we pay the cost thats why we here
With that said raise your glass in the air chea
All for one, and one for all
Gangsta to gangsta, worldwide salute to all
(X2)



Daily routine, mind and the body at equal balance
Knowing the body follow the mind just like a savage
Out to advance in my path chasing this cabbage
With a neccesary meaning for being aint hard to manage
Avoid being plastic in the fire, never melt down
Mental armor, the horror is being one of you clowns
Take a piss and sit in position, your hearts missing
We taking chances getting it cracking in moms kitchen
Supply and demand as far as your money allows
Circle small ducking pitfalls, and folding out
Large tables, breaking bread, kamikaze chambord
Queens get the royal feedings, whores treated like whores
 Transition to this position, came back from moving treys
No wait up, skipping to get my cake up
One in air for all my niggas on the wake up





Out in Houston in a astro van, Nigga a castro fan
Baking soda famous for my guns in abundance fam
Neck brace with diamonds in it
Ride around with lions crying ready to kill, they need a red steak
Sharks who surround water, or up in vegas
Blowing a quarter, neck glazing in the blazer
Kill for my daughter, thats a code
Now gone and crack it, Im up in the leaf jacket packing
16 shots in the slammer, ready to get lit
My integrity is the shit
Even through all the hostility im still here
Hip hop loves you, a hip hop dedication or fuck you
Nigga im the shit niggas know it
Glad i ain't trying to rob one of ya niggas, Get dumb on yall
Charles Bronson with an arson, Life like Sonny Carson
Darts fly out of my cartridge


Thats real nigga, You already know what it is
We do it extra extra extra ordinary
Shout out my real niggas, you know who the fuck ya niggas is
Salini Music nigga, My 1889 niggas waddup
To all my heights niggas you know what we do
Toast whats good, its the chef right here nigga
I got you covered, all day nigga
SUCCESS! Wassup nigga, bank commission ass nigga
Toast this shit was mean nigga, One




I start off snorting little tiny pinches
So that I know I won't get hooked
Not on no coke, you can't get hooked
My friends have been snorting 15 years, they ain't hooked


From the tone of the voice, it's moist and choice
A special, he shoot 'em in the face with them boy
Yo, from all them niggas off of Hoy Street, came this
Large nigga taking over parole
Crib all stretched out, bulletproof saunas
Furry minks, touching the ground, she slaughtered six shrinks
One of the primetime kings, all of the young niggas
Who lived it, will sit in the box and dream
He coppin' lots of things, he even got rasta connects
Now, he bling, if lord love me, he'll throw it up, all lovely
Open the shirt, all ugly
He kept the Purple Tape, hug me
Tell that nigga Chef, when that nigga get on, plug me
There it go, Barnaby Jones and Mugsy
Two wicked cops, try'nna get their names on the come up
Shit, do not fuck with me, I won't have it
If them niggas try to pull up, what's up, get me




Get money, get money, everybody know how we get down

Cash rule everything around me, C.R.E.A.M, get the money, pow!


As I polly making bread, they blowing shots of molly
Dressing fly, bitches looking, I'm in a coupe Ferrari
All my niggas holding digits for all the haters, sorry
Suck a dick, ain't nothing you can do about it, get your gunning on it
Yeah, popping bottles, they thought we'd hit the lotto
We were just crack slingers yesterday, all in them fucking titles
Man we just sure to blow, I know my hoes don't argue
That dick stand here, here what you gonna do? Champ yo I'mma roll, what y'all know?
I check the Walabee straight from England
Word, heard the album, I know your singles fam
Laced this, laced up, on my real real, wanna say something?
We stay crazy, we stay fronting, we spray shit, we ain't laced something
Fuck around, get your head twist, make your wrist mine, keep a bitch pissed
At the same time I'mma blaze Chris in a rich car, watch the Matrix
We take bricks, we send them out to the nearest town, you pay for it
We see low gangsters from the rip, yo hold that handle when you hold that clip


Get money, get money, everybody know how we get down

If you got it, light it up (8X)


Ain't no shook in 'em, Pyrex pots is hot, fiends is cooking 'em
Little niggas hugging the block, cops is booking 'em
Women hugging they purse when they spot the crook in 'em
Back when little J got shot, pops was whooping 'em
Little noses dripping with snot, ock, now look at 'em
The ghetto got a hook in 'em now, drugs, stay pushing 'em
Used to throwing dirt in these blunts, now, it's kush in 'em
Used to tell these chicks to shut up, now, he's shooshing 'em
Get cash, get that ass or put a foot in 'em
Iron Flag, flag that cab, Bedford and Put-e-nam
There ain't no puss in 'em, dick, dildo, or gush in 'em
Niggas still got that juks in 'em

 + (Raekwon)
If he front then we stomp 'em out (Get 'em out ya way pa)
If he drunk and he run his mouth (Get 'em out ya way pa)
If he front then we stomp 'em out (Get 'em out ya way pa)
(Get 'em out ya way pa, move, move, move)


I'm seduced by the chrome, it's a ruthless poem
It took a little time to get his juices going
Producers know him as the kid with the Iron Palm
Righteous hammer examine the firearm
Approach or get fired on, permanent chest scar
Empire Strikes Back, check out the Death Star
Bless y'all, wet y'all, do the impossible
Where I'm from we use dum-dums in the arsenal
Highly sparkable, get stretched off the knuckle check
Known to scuffle, I take it to the upper deck
Universal conquest, kung fu buckle vets
In a dufflebag, max yo, a couple techs
Give 'em ear hustle, Wu brand we programmed
Next time we dance, it won't be a slow jam
I fear no man, son you get lynched up
Nigga bitch get Frankenstein stitched up




Yeah, voice skipping off percussion
Give it to 'em how they love it, slow flow, deadly, beloved
All praise the daunting calm yet
So alarming, without a word being spoken
A thought with no voice, just a nod and a look
The contract was took, straight cash, off the books
A major pawn took a Don, look, he's armed
With a few black rooks from the heart of the Crook
Shook ones look while they hung him on Hercules hooks
They found his body near a shallow brook, escaped on foot
Switched the look up, out of state, he got the hook up
The flipped cake, thought lighter than the feather
Yet heavier than weight when my mindstate starts to break
Take cover over RZA instrumental
I'm damn near invincible, it's simple




Tell me, what are they like?
They got holes in the top, five round holes
While I was watching, this stranger, hit them
But his fingers went right through the bone
So then, they've... mastered it
It's some style of kung fu, you know it?
The Skeleton Claw




I was born and raised, in the ghetto
I was born and raised, in the ghetto
I was born and raised, in the ghetto
Listen to me, and just lay up


Park Hill Projects, one eight pound
Holding it down, that's the motto, 'lo goose and lottos
Blunts on the regular, O.G. style
I'm into old V's, swinging in cabs, slinging them OZ's
All I know is running in fiends' labs, hitting the green bags
Visualizing Chef in the green Jag's
Wait til I get on, the haters gonna hate it
In this corner, a rich young don with a crisp lab


*humming*
Brother, listen to me
Brother, listen to me
Listen to me, and just lay up
How do you make your bread in the ghetto?
How do you make your bread in the ghetto?


Hustling, hustle & flow
We make bread in the ghetto, by selling that crack
See niggas that make bread by busting the gat
Might stick a nigga up, stab him dead in his back
It's a dirty bread game, but we get through them stacks
Bread game, rather have bread than fame
Some sell pills and weed, it ain't no joke
Might sell anything as long as we not broke
So if you getting that bread, we be coming for your throat
It's crazy what a brother might do for the bread
Might violate parole til ya family is dead
We get bread in the ghetto, while we ducking the feds
I heard bread in the ghetto got a loaf on his head, come on


Brother, listen to me
Brother, listen to me
Listen to me, and just lay up
How do you get rid of rats in the ghetto?


Yo, yo, aiyo we ox 'em, duff 'em, stuff 'em in black bags
Torture them, toss 'em out the window with rift rafts
Cuz we don't take kindly to rats in the ghetto
Either your mouth stay shut or get slapped with the metal
Big fat rats get fried like porkchops for snitching
Get your ass hung like a wall clock
It's Tone Stark, Billy the Kid when the gun bark
A wire sticking out his shirt, he talking to NARC!


How do you raise your kids in the ghetto?
How do you raise your kids in the ghetto?
Feed one child and starve another
Tell me, tell me, and just lay up


We like brothers, we came from the same mothers
In the projects, under the same covers
Wore the same drawers, fucked the same whores
Rolled dice, kicked rhymes, did crimes in the same hall
Sprayed our names on the same wall
Yo, your kids knew my kids, your wiz knew my wiz
Now you caught up in music and showbiz
If that's what it is, then that's what it is
Run up in your crib, with twelve black brothers
That'll digest to live, die just to live
Some called us martyrs, some called us fathers
Run up in the club like the suicide bombers
We be the brothers, ready past lovers
Never wanna see us, blow, we not others
Somewhere in the competition, friends got lost
The money got flipped, your tables got crossed
Now you all caught up in that label talk
Brain dead in the grain of thoughts
With a name and a game that can change New York
We ate from the same fork, pop had the same thought *echo*



Word up....
You know you like a Donald Goines nigga, thats off top....

(Carl Thomas) "I got bills and shit to pay, and another mouth on the
Way, I'm ghetto"

(Raekwon) Thats right, thats what I'm talkin' 'bout, tell the young boys
Out there man"

(D-Dot) "Takin' it back on some soulful type shit, Hip-Hop in it's rare
Form"

(Carl Thomas) "Spend a dollar on some wine, hand my clothes out on the
Line, I'm ghetto"

(Raekwon) "Now ya'll niggas wanna wear Polo and Hilfiger"

(Carl Thomas) "See me cruisin' down the lane, doin' two miles per hour
Baby, I'm ghetto"

(Raekwon) "Yall wanna go places like Vegas and Beverly Hills like every
Three seconds"

(Carl Thomas) "I'm not ashamed of my Fam, I can't help it who I am, I'm
Ghetto"

(D-Dot) "We just wanna talk to ya'll, tell ya'll a lil' somethin'"

(Raekwon) "I tell the story for the young black youths out there"

(Verse 1: Raekwon)
Yo, it started out in East New York
Where I grew up, knew how to walk
Favorite carry weapon was a fork
Older folks smoked out, straglers
Almost had to bust a Marvin Haglar
Starvin' for mine, bust three at ya
Dad fucked up consecutively
Him and some relatives is Gangsters, sellin' Pussy
Moms dropped him on the spot
Smacked me in the knot
Only he gave you was your name and these blocks
That's ya Pops
Still, thats me still
Keep it real
If it wasn't for him and his steel there probably wouldn't be a meal
We in his Caddy siliconed out, zoned out
Three days away from home he stoned out
Coke on the table, pressin' redial
Son I'm sendin' you home, nigga you foul
Yo, why you doin' that? but gettin' big
Half the niggas I run wit' gettin' jig
The other fifty cent balancin' a bid
Oh shit, got this bitch seeded
Cop pleaded
What should I do? knock your self off, God succeeded
And the most scariest part? Better have heart
Cause the Lions and wolves will rip you apart
Make a brick and get barred
Shoot joints, get involved
Put tints on your windows, whip cars
Yeah, all the giants revolve
Black carry-on, ready to die for the family hard
Alcoholic vultures with toasters
Sheep skins on
Leather V Bombers, bums with no coats on
We livin' financially fucked up, gotta have credit
Smoke a bag of wet and set it
The block we deaded
Society wrong, we too black and too strong to prolong
Got my woman with a gun in her thong
It's kinda wild how we livin'
The Devil fall has arisen
We travel from here to prison
A presidency shelter for my elders
That's real, cause we need them and they need us, that's wealth for ya
Leavin' on this moment
Meditate, Four in the Mornin'
Nigga you straight.....

Chorus (Carl Thomas)
I got hustlin' on my mind otherwise I'm feelin' fine, I'm ghetto
I like black tint on my car, at the park a Superstar, I'm ghetto
See me cruisin' down the lane, two miles per hour Baby, I'm ghetto
I'm not ashamed of my Fam, I can't help it who I am, I'm ghetto

(Verse 2: Madd Rapper)
Born in the gutter
A Black Pops and a Puerto Rican Mother
I kept a stolen whip and razor sharp box cutter
Known from Albany Ave to 98th and Sutter
My leathers was pleathers while ya'lls was butter
Robbin' and hustlin' anything for a profit
Thirteen years old 3 Months in Spofford
Crime, I couldn't stop it
Didn't pass the Tenth grade
School was cool but it didn't keep our rent paid
So every Wednesday me and my Dogs
Hop the train for a Ki in the Bronx
Knowin' all along the shit was wrong
Ain't the first and damn sure ain't the last
It keeps goin' on, so keep movin' on
Same old story, my Pops left
Waves and Pony's and mock necks
Tre's and Forty's and hot sex
With around the way bitches
From around the way riches, yo, my block reps
I stay Brooklyn zoned, underground is how I network
Million dollar meetings in Timbs and sweatshirts
So pardon my appearance, everythings all good
Nigga I'm just like you except I'm from the hood

Chorus (Carl Thomas)
I got bills and shit to pay, and another mouth on the way, I'm ghetto
(D-Dot - this goes out to all my peoples in the hood, in ghettos all
Around the nation and all around the World, knowhatI'msayin'?)
Spend a dollar on some wine, hang my clothes out on the line, I'm ghetto
See me cruisin' down the lane, doin' two miles per hour Baby, I'm ghetto
I'm not ashamed of my Fam, I can't help it who I am, I'm ghetto
Does anyone mind the truth ya'll?
Does anyone mind the truth ya'll?
Does anyone mind the truth ya'll?
Does anyone mind the truth ya'll?



* unedited lyrics; The PJ's soundtrack is clean


What? Aiyyo, y'all wanna do a track wit us or some shit?
We the billion dollar boys club
What you got a hundred thousand for us? The fuck's that?
Three rings and a hair cut or some shit?
Aiyyo, American Cream Team, baby
Heavy hitters, New York City Giants
Gamble for plots and 4 better for spots and things of that nature
Pop off


I don't rock wit hoes, I puff Optimos
Your label ship gold, but only copper sold
Perb got flows, everybody and God knows
Fuck a bitch for two dimes, she got to cop those
Used to be a thug, now he wear cop clothes
Try to come to the hood and we shot hoes


I don't care who you got a deal wit or who you chill wit
Banky'll run up in your session and shut you down on some real shit
Till the Chef be like (Chill, kid)
That's word to Abola Perrione, dem not know who they deal wit
Chef Banks, uh-huh, slash Banky
Got the whole world callin Flex tryin to transtate me
Said New Jack City 2, Banky B. Nino, push a 2000 benz-ino


These rap icons, mass spit fire out of cons
Fuck a bigon, rely on ion in my python
We squeeze off, long disc when we piss
Resort this, gun powder coverin wrist is blastphemist
Shotties say, "Fuck!", cursin my name
Knowin damn well, I'm hurtin the same
What part of the game you playin?
Kid, I'm sayin, yo, three months ago you was on
You fallin short now, chasin a don, you're money ain't loned
Faggot fuck, bag him, stick him in the back of my truck
Strip him and smack him up for actin up
Be slitherin, hit him in the rips again
Broke the code of honor that we livin in
Depleted the whole click, is never when
But never that


Aiyyo, there it go again, same shit, just rep
Show me ya holdin kid, control ya rep when we rollin
Worldwide, niggas look live, collection cream by a land slide
Settin up to son, won the grand prize
Stand up, why? Where it came from? Accord and the 5
Where the name from? Read the Rob, yo
Yo, while we handglide, slang lye
Chill, ya better recognize, cuz it's cut out for big shit, Giant Size


Yo, we from the ghetto, the land where everythin is real
Nights was tough, days came hard as steel
Still we played the field like players witout contracts
Broke the trends and the fans far beyond that
Comin to America, now we tradin places (uh-huh)
New faces in the hood, and they racist (uh-huh)
]From all the squeezin, they callin the precinct
We could battle in ya PJ's or battle in the becon!


I kick vocals at the top of my lungs, drunk
Playin cards, young start wildin on dunns with guns
Remmy doctor, old man jams with voice of Hoffa
Chill, slap shorty up at the opera (Battle in the becon!)
Uncle got the Kangaroo, rock the Kangaroo, boo
Start cursin out white boys shoes, you wild
Thirstin Howl wit a growl start barkin at crowds
He actin like he got shark skin now


I lace my hookers with G-String, Liz Clairborne
Don the King, hustlin, nigga Don I mean
Exquisite, a radiant, brilliant chemist
American Cream Team, billion buck spenders
Strip boutiques, advantage, get move on
We too strong, the menace, nothin to lose con
Yachts we cruise on, money that's too long
Pull out a check book, coupon, purchase the Yukon




It's never been a game, stop playin, stop playin (repeat to fade)




Since rap got locked right before we visit the '90's
Chef in the kitchen, cooking up with the crimies
It's late fall, dime season, we bought the crib
Next to Bill Clinton mother, cause she fuck with the Chinese
They hitting niggas with heroin, it's fourteen of us with Beemers
We won't stop pitching the ChevronIt's packed, kid, black kids don't know how to act
They flashing macks, Gillette's, a couple of stacks, yo
The systems is 'oopid', yup, shorty with the pumps on
And dunks get provided and scooped, kid
And bloodhounds is hating, they knowing how the kid get down
Silent shotties with grenades, I'm waiting
And everybody love vintage, you see like 4/5 niggas
With half moons and wave intentions
What's really good? The 'dro hit 'em, killed 'em in the hotel
Heard he had some old chick with him


That's how we make it happen, that's how we break it down
Hood all day, nigga, watch how we take the town
That's why we do the do, just know who is who
Acknowledge me all day, and understand Wu is Wu


Yo, but on the other side of town it's Tony, laid up
This white chick want to gargle my nuts
I put the Bailey's down, tap the blunt out
Grabbed her by her hair watch blondie-love whip my dick out
Spit dripping down my balls, she slobbing me
That's right, suck that dick, get it hard for me
Pyrex in one hand, large amount of grams in it rocked up
And she pregnant, my little man got her knocked up
He popped up (oh shit), I'm like a crooked cop
Richard Gere, big smirk on, getting my cock sucked
He pulled the joint out, a bullet spun out, but it was too late
Already nutted on the side of her mouth
Side of her face, and hair like "Something About Mary"
I can't front, my son gun look scary, chill
She's a whore, you knew it from the time we ran trains on her
And you still went and fucked her raw
Come on, son, give me the gun, you going to kill me over this
Bum-ass bitch, you can't resist
Remember Vel had her in the telly, taking the fist
Watch how you aiming that shit, you should be aiming at Trish
She take a bone like a rib-eye steak at Ruth's Chris
Yo, be easy on the trigger, son, you squeezing the fifth
I only did it just to show you, she's the easiest bitch
He came close, had to duff him, nigga, give me that shit


That's how we make it happen, that's how we break it down
Hood all day, nigga, watch how we take the town
That's why we do the do, just know who is who
Acknowledge me all day, and understand Wu is Wu


Fucking gun motherfucka
Pull a fucking gun on me again, I'll blow your little balls off
Go to the store and get me a fucking 40 'fore I smack the shit out you, man
Word up, while you're at it go to the freezer, get a steak man, for your eye, nigga
Word up
Put some bologna on your face or something, nigga
Make sure my 40 cold, too, when you bring it back
And when you get back, bag this shit up nigga
Word up
I don't give a fuck if you 25 nigga you my son, nigga, word up
That's why I let you slide, nigga, word
Get you a 40 too, and a pacifier, nigga
A bib and a diaper




Remix, Miss Fiona
You know it just your boy Busta Bust
I got a gift I've been wanting to give you a long time, check


In case it was misunderstood
If you let me give it to you, I'mma give it to you good
Give it to you every opportunity I can
As far back, seated on the hood of the car
No obligation, ma, you know I'm with that
Long as you respect me, I respect you back
Let me keep you stressed free, baby girl, no pressure
Extra, when I give it to you on the dresser
Look, don't run from it, baby, hold steady
Let me give it to you throughbred, grown man ready
Lay the game down heavy, baby girl, ain't never end so good
You gon' wanna talk about me to your friends
Go ahead and teach me, maybe we can get up later
You know how to reach me, baby
I'mma call you my teacher
Cuz if you can't give it to me right, I don't want it at all neither


I don't want it all the time
But when I get it, I, have to be satisfied
So give it to me right, or don't give it to me at all
I don't think you understand
How real it is to me to find a man who thinks he can
So give it to me right, or don't give it to me at all


I love you with your hair low, there you go
Bought every color bag, made your gear game grow
You was fly, still, everybody knew I ride
I had a good one, she knew the times, thrown her up
Miss Fiona, sassy, sleep me over
Jump in the fence, just to sneak, creep over, baby
Lady with a good heart, a good home
A good dude, come out of Bloom', it's over
Hah, you know I'm insecure, now
Jump out the Rose wit the ring and go south
I'm never that beefy, you complete me
All of that riffing and dripping and street beef
Yeah, all the punks, I picked 'em
Just like the boogers on your face, I licked 'em
Yeah, you know you extra sassy
Who gave you life, who made you classy?


I don't want it all the time
But when I want it, you, better make me smile
So give it to me right, or don't give it to me at all
I don't think you understand
If you can't please me, I, know someone who can
Give it to me right, or don't give it to me at all


This is the real life, baby
This is the life that makes me say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This is the real thing, baby
When I'm alone I can make me say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah




Give it to me right, yeah, yeah
Give it to me right, yeah, yeah
Give it to me right, or don't give it...



(Intro: Raekwon)
Yea baby
Word up man
It's all real and shit

(Verse 1: Raekwon)
She had a pretty little face
Her frame was one in a million
Jumped out the Wraith
Thats paid I need to film it
Silk on (?) girl Balli's
Going to Cali
Keep it dollar
We just got married
Honeymoon lampin' in Cancun
The kid had mad boom
Buy her bags bloom you got it
Fresh fly diva
Puff a little reefer
That deep
People today like how you got her
All game plan
Fly high level
No playing fam
I'm just that gift
Check the whip kid
Went on a chase
Runnin' like the Blues Brothers from Jakes
Thats my time
A closed case

(Hook: Sylvia Striplin)
Do you want me?
Do you want me in the way I really need you?
Do you need me?
Do you need me in the way I really want you?
Do you want me?
Do you want me in the way I really need you?
Do you need me?
Do you need me in the way I really want you?
Give me your love (repeats)

(Verse 2: Sylvia Striplin)
When I see you
Thats the time my body feels
I've got to have you
When I get you
Let me show you all the ways
I've got to show you that I love you
And it feels a little true
Don't leave this
Baby cause I'm hungry
Yes I'm hungry for the taste
Of your sweet flavor
Oh oh yah

(Hook)




When I woke up this morning
I found myself alone
I turned to touch her hair
And she was gone, she was gone
And there beside my pillow
Were her tears from the night before
She said give up your guns and face the law

I robbed a bank in Tampa
And I thought I had it made
But the hounds picked up my trail within the glades
So I ran
And I stumbled on this cabin
And she came to me to me once more
She said give up your guns
She said give up your guns
She said give up your guns
And face the law


This is a stick up, stick up
Pistols will lift up, lift up
If you don't get up, get up
Your hands
Kwe tell 'em


Succumb to the violence
And we get numb and get silent
Get my gun into firing
I'm never runnin' or hidin'



About a hundred any minute bullets runnin' from the guns
In front of any one of y'all youngins
We ain't trippin in the winter
Still killin' spring chickens
We ain't slippin, we ain't sittin'
You ain't listen this is me
Bitch this Is Nickel bitch
I'm G
With my nigga Kweli
Get back gettin' stacks since 03'
No strings yo swing wack
Spittin' crack makin' tracks
Like a dope fiend oh
Me and my team hot
Dream team I done seen
Obscene fiends seein'
Nigga whole backdrop
Like a green screen stuck before its cream
So they stuck him up in Sing Sing
I know what you mean dog
I been caught between walls
I don't kill (I'm the boss)
I just make Scream calls
I don't aim I don't give a speech in the streets
Like I'm livin' in the movie
I just let the thing off
Hittin' up my funds while I'm rippin up the slums
With the only pistol left
Cause they givin up they
Guns

Chorus:
And now I'm in this cabin where my own true love should be
Instead there lies a note she wrote to me
And it said: though you can't live by the bullet
But you sure as dead can die
My love give up your guns or say goodbye
Goodbye
And the sheriff now is calling with a shotgun at my door
Son
Give up your guns
And face the law




Hell naw my niggas don't make speeches
Cause we ain't no fake preachers
Or follow fake teachers
Soon as the state releases
You from the bank
You not a citizen
You quickly learn the difference
Between rights and privileges
Nothin' like Deliverence
Remember when Sai got shot?
Yo it was winter he layed on the ice shiverin'
Comfortably numb
He was killed for being hungry and young
Violently is how the company run
They dump in the slum
See the flashing lights and the gun
At the end of the tunnel no rebuttal to run
The blood is the sum of the equation
When you add up the factors
The splatters attractive
Life don't matter to rappers
So we glorify and glamorize
Talk about our plans to die
And learn to always stay inside the motherfuckin' camera's eye
Get my good side, murder is so sexy
But the hood cried every time one of us would die


Give up my guns never you crazy?
I'm all blazey
All 80 fly out
Put you right out lets try it out
Save the babies
Bressed to impress
Blow a hole in your vest
With suitcase money I roll up the stretch
High powered 9's Mausbergs
Squeeze faster than new V's
Fresh new bags of bullets or bean
Got my paper poppin' and plottin'
I blow a hole right through your stocking
Come out your back and scratch up your lockin'
We real killas and don dons
Pop through the vagabond tons
Boulevards where niggas will pull a card
Wrong songs don't play me lady killas
Baby guerrillas with hate feelings
That'll spray up the ceilings
The best ninjas in the business
Mind your business
Staten judicious
Malicious team we live in the kitchens
And dis niggas go the fuck home
Bring better biscuits
Come to the rally and flash if you with this


I'm not playin'. We shoot niggas. All day. Keep them hollows nigga. They got
New little guns. New little joints with long baby missiles in it. Them the
Joints we play with nigga. The Einsteins is on nigga. Hard bottoms in
The hoodie. Ice Water nigga. Word up. General Shala Raekwon. All day
E'day. A professional. Yeah. Get that money niggas. Don't never give up
Them guns. You stupid?




Yo, met this piece by the name of Sharise
She had a fly 190 resting in Jones Beach
You know when we kicking my everday cliche
Yo boo, can I poly with you, what make my day
She threw her chin up in the air, said yeah
Your style is played out, black, like last year
What do you mean, huh? You know what I mean Dunn
Callin me Dunn had me open like I was the one
What did I have on God Guard or Clairborne
You know you had that rugged type of shit on Raekwon
Maybe I talk a bit, kick a few words and shit
But you drove off in some Nissan phat shit
Givin me bad looks, lookin like mad crooks
If I was a purse downtown I would have been took
Yeah from robsters, but you look like mobsters
Smoking that weed had me nauseous like Rastas


When we're together you blow my mind, uh huh
You have that way about ya that keeps me satisfied
(What you want?) All I wanna do is give you all I got


If I give you all I got would you be there for me baby (all I got)
And if I keep you close to me would you give me everything I need
The way I want it to be (that's the way it should be)


I wanna be there for you, boy, in every way
I just gotta tell you how you take my breath away
I wanna let you know


When you walked into my life (walked into my life)
I had this feeling you brought my world alive
And I'm going crazy, my head is in a daze (head is in a daze)
You amaze me, boy why don't you stay (boy why don't you stay)




She's a fly fabulous bird from out of nowhere
We bungalo dolo in logear, free parole the whole year
Now acknowledge me, God mentality, fly formality
Cut out on me, I'm kidnapping half of your salary
We movin like this, for real now, shut down your will power
Flower, whatever you doing, don't disrespect ours
Slidin my work to the next man
Still I'm giving you props now gets your karats on the nightstand








Yeah, yo son you gotta take me to get them Clarks, man
Yo, check it out, yo
Yo, I got a new, yooo! Niggas don't even know son
Yo check the joint, boom
Yo I got a crazy idea how to do Clarks now
Check it out, boom, this is how you freak 'em, boom
You go get you go get the cream joints right? Boom
Now now, all you all you dye, is this shit right here, boom
And this, you know what I'm saying? Any color you want
But it'd be like, blue and cream, you know what I'm saying?
Shit like that, niggas don't even know
But son word is bond I'ma rock niggas this summer
On the real, know what I'm saying?
Yo son, I had crazy visions
Check it out check it out check it out, boom
Just imagine if you buy, woo! Check it out
Just imagine you bought navy blue, right
A navy blue, a navy blue pair right, boom
Of this, of this shit, know what I'm saying?
But dyed get this dyed cream on top
Just imagine that color like
But you got it dripping like it's marble cake like...


Stand on the block, Reebok, gun cocked
Avalanche rock get paid off mass murderous services
Chef break 'em, watch the alley cats bake 'em
Four-nine made 'em, drop grenades and take 'em
Quick fast we reflect like the sky be blue true
Wu-Tang saga continue
Rap Meyer Lansky crash your fantasy
Getting high fellas stand by, here's the plan, see
Sit back collecting Tecs and cheques and
Blowing slow in a Montero flexing
Beats break heavily word to INS bless me
Throw me like three bags of cess
For real from the Killah Hill locked and caged in
We're sworn representatives, we acting like made men
Strive for wives, nine lives and lies
Max, sell and enjoy the highs, what?


The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Baker baker, pull off a keystone kaper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and watch me scrape her


Proceed with caution as you enter the symphony
Degrees of punishment increase intensely
Syndrome was caused by the deadly drums
But the battle was won by swords being swung
Slicing with a vocal, from the international vocalist
Your style is too local to fuck with this
Offensive antagonist
No assistance, moving motionless
Mysterious swiftness
Thoughts roll down the shaft of the brain
Mental gives the signal to the physical
Whirlwind kicks and hits from every angle
Violent temperaments left continents dented
Poison vintage wine rhymes I invented
Drunk by the drunken puncheons that punctures the heart
Vital sparks from the arteries stopped


The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Baker baker, pull off a keystone kaper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and watch me scrape her


Straight up and down it's all good
Peace to them cheque cashing, chain snatching, gun flashing
Niggas in the hoods bubbling good
Analyze Starks, who be buying lion heads and Clarks
To all my house bitches, Starks'll be home soon
I'm on tour chill, catch me '96 in June
But until then my ten-man team be safe
Chill on the whips for seven months, we can all get laced
Take a boat cruise, sip daiquiris and max
Swimming pools, fly jewels, Wally shoes, blow stacks
Relax kids, black kids got a craving for Cris
Until we get back, unpack, leave the Mac with your Wis'
But whatever, I gotta hit other sides of the Earth
Spread Wu-ness, rule this, civilization's cursed
But luckily I'm born to be wild and then be out
Move crowds collect twenty thou and then be out
Heavy convoys my crew keep pretty boys paranoid
Built like a steroid pat down Dan Aykroyd
My seeds, grow with his seeds, marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family


The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Baker baker, pull off a keystone kaper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and watch me scrape her


My seeds, run with his seeds, marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family



It's been a long time since the father left in '69
It's been a long time since Wu Tang had the chance to shine
It's been a long time since we had diamonds, gold and drink Cristal wine
It's been a long time of walking around here dumb, deaf, and blind
It's been a long time since you had the Son of Man chant like golden wine
It's been a long time...

Recalcados piram, vo criticar

Wise Intelligent, broadcasting live from the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro
Know what I'm saying?
Hip hop go wherever I go
For real, Poor Righteous Teachers represent
'96 off the hook we're dropping this hit kid
Watch


Lord, how you be, madam G, peace God
Fuck frauds, get yours, kick ass, leave scars
On Mars I built a school to study life on Earth
Thoughts burst, a million rappers murdered in the first verse
Now what's worse than eating dirt, being buried alive
Put to death by surprise in the name of black gods
Ain't I most fly? Young pie don't cry
Dry the tears from your eye and your lover might live
Life to give, life to take, never making mistakes
All wise enjoying everything right and exact
Poor facts, pro-black, Donnelly Homes projects
Learn that time is the same on Casio or Rolex
Knowledge James, chapter two, verse one through six
But try not to judge a man by the price of his kicks
Come off this talk shit  convert words to actions
Cause you know Jersey runs things every time boy
Build destroy, Trenton must make noise
Enjoy the fruits of life, need the wife and my boys
My seed won't need for anything, trust me
Black man, 'nuff land, eight hundred acres of trees
Please the seven seas travel regularly
Degrees consciously study everywhere we be
Family daring he who talks enough shit
And come and get the stitch to fix the split upper lip
The shit providers
Will call us great civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers black


Whatever happened to the Gods and the Earths
They thirst for a pot of gold God's worth is birth
Knowledge is worth more than diamonds
When the mind is shining, surprise us
Gods Earths and 85ers


Dedicated to the Gods and the Earths
Dip dip dive-a, civilize an 85er


Intelligent, twenty-three, now nineteen five
Hold the mic I'll rise right in front of your eyes
In here six years see what I felt every year
Oh yeah it's ninety-six I'm born and understanding, understood
Get the goods, build a school down south
In some remote location that nobody knows about
Teach, add on to the life that we live
God degree, twelve jewels, eat the foot that I give
No pig, strictly kosher mathematics and fact
Poor blacks on track mission to take the Earth back
Cause Whitey got it locked, that's why the whole world's lost
We wearing crowns made of thorns and being put to the cross
Lost souls futures told in the Dead Sea Scrolls
God reduced to a savage lacking soul control
Talking lots of shit about his drugs and guns
Several daughters, 'nuff sons, ain't trying to raise none, yo
Whoa-ho-ho, let me slow up with the flow
Can't move too quick because niggas got to know
The duty of the civilized is to civilize the uncivilized
And make the world recognize
That God is Wise, and Wise is God to the death
And back to life, you Lazarus and I'm the Christ
The forthcoming, like a thief in the night
The wave of light, the key to everlasting life
That shit provide us, to call us straight civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers y'all


Whatever happened to the Gods and the Earths
They thirst for a pot of gold God worth his birth
Knowledge is worth more than diamonds
When the mind is shining, surprise us
Gods Earths and 85ers

 (x2)
Dedicated to the Gods and the Earths
Dip dip dive-a, civilize an 85er


Since I've been away I've been thinking about
How gunslingers turned singers and black culture went out
Wake up all you teachers tired of teaching and wait
Grass roots, pass truth into the ears of black youths
Watch me talk the talk and walk the walk right now
As mystic as it seems, I bring for real to your dream seeing
Midnight marauder got it dipped off the block drug
Street niggas bug cause they know we do it for the love
We rose above every limit that they said we had
Who loves your ass enough to strictly educate the mass?
Come get your cash, fill your mind with swine and dash
For longevity, these niggas we will never be
You will remember we from now till forever G
I am infinity, lyrics flowing endlessly
You ain't no friend to me so don't even pretend to be
Like O.J. Simpson be sleeping with the enemy
I call you out and make the world know your ass is lacking
Quoting some lessons but see no parts of understanding
You standing under my rain, snow, sleet, hail and thunder
That's why you wonder what's causing this to exist
I raise the mist, distill the myths of many currents
Don't be determined except to life forget the death
Nevertheless you're being blessed cause I'm who God is
Don't know the time niggas must be wearing Guess watches
Hands on your boxes, turn 'em up like seven notches
Your Magnavoxes amplify my super conscious
Shit providers, we'll call us straight civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers y'all


Hold it down kid and you don't stop
P.R.T. represent shop
(There's a new set of rules you shall all have to abide by
And the non-lyrical shall be terminated)




Yes, Uh huh, Go


We rep a new style, I'm higher then whatever in the two thousand
I'm like Isaac in his teenage days, Gettin thousands yep
Flip em in the M, Suede tims on, Blue housin up
They know my niggas is proud kins, We vanish
Sippin Kahluas, We on the block frozen
Whatever, Niggas wanna do us then do us
We like Roberta Flack in the gap band
And curtis who urges to stack grands
Scareface flicks, We eat are grits wit eggs in em
None of the roach legs in em
Watchin Soul Train, Everybody dipped in denim
With beads on they neck and they braids, Just like Stevie cover
You gotta see me brother brushin my waves
And now a few march, A few good men, They carry cartridges
A smoke ???, Now we all gettin trimed
They play the deuce loose, Ol' gold juice
BVDs on, Adidas no laces, Drankin pineapple fruits
But uh...

When people get shot down for not mindin theirs
So many young adolescence with no careers
You got ten-eleven year olds drinkin beers
So when you go home nigga hit up the fridge and then what




Old dro bottles, and blow, blowin' from both zones
Layin' in them Tahoes we own the projo's
Three for tenement we in the lobby with the big
(da dun dun dun) Don't move cause I'm a representative
Live for the street, ask, you die in the war
'member that -- blast that three atcha -- hide in the wall
We gangsta, republicans with them big things, big rings
Get your head shot off, daddy you don't believe chains
Loose cameras, big hammers, Station Wagon, blue Phantoms
Smokin' the block up, y'all witness the zoo gamblers
We ain't takin' no shorts, its just the early 80's
That made me, now I sit paid and then maybe
Nothing but my Lords and raps, these bags of dope
Under the mattress and I clack like a slave key
Wash your squad up, I roll double refuse to rock
Closed up my door up and murked you on the job (aww)


Gettin' money like back in the days
Niggas like shower posse in a spectacular drug games
Slayin' niggas, steady sprayin niggas, till the task forces'll roll up
In unmarked vehicles and will be layin' niggas
Streched that coke and see it come back triple
When we O.T. cut it with baking soda or quinine
Strategize, gettin' paper like the Chinese, Jamaicans
And George Chain niggas, and watch me set up a Goldmine


We got guns tucked in our waistlines with rags hangin' from our back pockets
Miraculous money, nigga, can't stop it
Sherlock Holme' Kangols
Medallions so big, attach strings you could turn 'em into banjos
Phenomenal profiting, drug money
Scram rapper, my 100EX golden like a honey graham cracker
Sidewinda, niggas tryna' infiltrate, blind-side a nigga
Hit you with the 8, we in the club
Dumbin' out, drunk in fronta the airbrush
Backdrop, ones out, fi'-dollas for picture with the guns out
Juggle for a couple days, close shop
Then continue to bubble until the strip hotter than a microwave
Don't stop, travel on my spare time
And keep niggas wit us to push our shit like George Jefferson hairline
No frill, niggas better go chill
'Fore this gun go up in your nose like coke sniffin' up your nose-stril


Gettin' money like back in the days
Niggas like shower posse in a spectacular drug games
Slayin' niggas, steady sprayin niggas, till the task forces'll roll up
In unmarked vehicles and will be layin' niggas
Streched that coke and see it come back triple
When we O.T. cut it with baking soda or quinine
Strategize, gettin' paper like the Chinese, Jamaicans
And George Chain niggas, and watch me set up a Goldmine


Ay yo, saluteme kid, coop me in the red room booth
And eatin' Fruit Loops it's all for the loot boo
Designated hammer that'll lay ya up scrambling
Blant ninjas get 'em more popped up, and start blowin' niggas magnums up
Caught me in the mix wit some rich soldiers, that reaction
Is a key action, black sent forty doja's up
We huddle in big plans, my big mans and them
Slick as the shit breaks from outtas you, rip dip, then quakes them


See I was always good at science, in the class I was dope
Ask 'em for the chemistry temperature now I'm cookin' the coke up
Used to sit and watch them older niggas for hours
And did acknowledge to how cold water quickly harden the powder
Took your turn into somethin big to acredit (uhh)
But ya needs connect shit up from South America
Money calculations, told B.I.G. I sit up on it still
Holdin old hundred dollar bills, wit small faces


Gettin' money like back in the days
Niggas like shower posse in a spectacular drug games
Slayin' niggas, steady sprayin niggas, till the task forces'll roll up
In unmarked vehicles and will be layin' niggas
Streched that coke and see it come back triple
When we O.T. cut it with baking soda or quinine
Strategize, gettin' paper like the Chinese, Jamaicans
And George Chain niggas, and watch me set up a Goldmine



(JD Era)
Its rainin this year im dolo outside low boots on
Waitin on the bars ,bags full of grey poupon
We about the CREAM,and the letters and croutons
He pulled up, big bodied benz with a suit on

Get back touch you got a dutch

JD Era
Come on its on deck




I said hold up, ma, I'll make you look good, get it understood
Don't get it twisted, when I ride through the hood
26 inches, blowing nothing but the good
Got the Alpine bumping


Extra saucy, fly niggas is flossy, caught 'em in the Bentley wagging
Swinging remorsely, guns I'm waving 'em
Braze a nigga facial, still in the hood, got my hands and them lazers, now
Blow them niggas labels down, rhyme, I brag
Yellow Jag', elephant black leather
The Tuskigi look, I master the swagger rhyming
Playing corners, shopping enormous, rocking black watch faces
The band is racist, I'm mourning
I feel like Malcolm in his prime, nines on me
Kill them lines, we living in them airs with wears
You heard of us, the most powerful glastrinomical
I'm used to big shit, light hitting off the big tower, boo
You know I'm puffin' that good kush, hood 'dro, slide through
Antique whip, helping the hood blow, I'm all about papers
The face makers, who chase heavy, thick cake, head of the state
Fire escape capers...




Allah himself
Man, woman, child
The book of life
Starks Enterprise!


Take out the rap kingpin, the black Jesus
I know a few niggas sniff coke and caught seizures
Peace to ten thousand seaters
And all y'all pretty ass Libras
My Tommy dick'll blow y'all ass to pieces
I love fuckin with y'all I got the George Jeff walk
Look how I dance, favorful robes, bows and all sorts
Hold on, who turned the lights on?
Word to my microphone and preach on
Brother, that's that bullshit in my right arm
Crackhead stop it, dope pusher stop it
The father sent me a message and I came to drop it
The prophet is to love each other
Michael Jordan/Jackson, Cosby money, Oprah
They got our love by go get Africa


Harmony, grits, welfare cheese
Whips, cheque data first in the fifth
What Ghost?


Fuck y'all niggas an' fuck y'all bitches an'
Fuck the pictures y'all takin, fuck the whip you in
Starsky bring home the dough now the show is over
(It's over) It's over? (It's over) It's over?


Timberland, crack snorkels, jewels, cash insurance
Tai hold, fly clothes and El Deramo
5 plus 5 O's, one plus 9 O's
Save our self, reach our goals


What if the BIBLE wasn't good?
And good was bad, as bad as it should
It matters, feed em power food
The wonders that Allah will do
Maybe he'll discover you
Look 'em like a couple of jewels
Ticket traum' was old, that plus the God ain't loved the way I move
People see me, G. Deini
He beeny on the cell, seen me?
You need me, you read me
Captain over, get that weed to me
The champion, the vigilante
Ask me what the surface could be
In me like Marcus Camby
Hear me, I fuck with family
Dons, chew on this, the hit list got
All of your names, so y'all lames is hist'
I kissed the bangin-est bitch (all night) that's famous for her tits
Not that tall doofy chick in your hood called Snitch
Come on!


Bentleys for sharp shoes
Similac, Huggies, big Shizam jewels


Infrared shootin at niggas
We back execution niggas
Markin it mummy, he money, he fly bummy
Super wizzers, look like Luther bitches
Still catches ill inventions
Strength, real niggas holdin blitz as real as ninjas
So illable, wheel of promotin like Benz dealer
Instiller, get real for hugs, lets chill feel I'm ill with colour
Yo bacon, straight cake, layin on my paper aces
Fuck all your under statements
Battle us? Battle gauges


A big mansion, real product of the strip scampy
Cell boat, big yacht, and beige Hummer
Summer home, big stones and cologne
Remember heroes? I guess them corner days is gone
Mommy got a house, Daddy got a house
Granny got a house, we moved out
That's right, we moved out
Now that's what I'm talkin about


Smackin all y'all stars and chumps
Gettin cash in the larger sums
Shootin dice in the church with nuns
We come with the biggest guns




Shifty, low-down, gritty, and grimy
Like Fredro -- fuck it, I get the bread though
I'll take the nine and buck it up at your head, though
I'll run your jewels, you do it because I said so
Ride around the hood with niggas that let the lead go
I would never rat, told my lawyers to tell the Feds so
Word to the bullpen sandwich and the bedroll
Like Starks in the Game of Thrones, let my head roll
Real nigga, nigga real
Team full of shooters, willing to pull the trigger still
If they see you ain't got it, they'll take it from you
If they feel like you pussy, they'll be waiting for you
I ain't pussy, go 'head and wait
You the dickhead that the bullet's gon' penetrate
Dead nigga, dumb nigga
Fuck you up, kill the shit, noose, redrum nigga


I really drink Tiger Balm (you could Google that)
And I shot niggas too (you could Google that)
See, I smoke big (you could Google that)
You heard of me a little bit? (you could Google that)
Fuck niggas (you could Google that)
Nigga, fuck the other side (you could Google that)
Fuck niggas (you could Google that)
Nigga, fuck the other side (you could Google that)


I'm from the era of the stick house
Where niggas used to cook bricks at the chick house after you re-up
Dominicans, Washington Heights, they had me up
Dimelo; weather so cold, it's like three below
My kicks stay fresh like a brand-new baby ass
I found a Chinese chick with a crazy ass
I call her "Suck-Me-Off" -- all she did was suck me off
All she want was won tons, soup, and some butter-soft
Leather; she told me that she Googled my name up
Shootings, robberies, and big coke came up
See, I'm an accurate shooter through your medula
You could get your ruler
Bought a missile the size of Zab Judah
I smoke weed, no other shit
The widow's getting high off some other shit
You could keep that, respect to you
Get out of line, put the heater to your neck to you




We get more money than Google, y'all niggas is doo-doo
Throw the Mac in your mouth and butt-fuck your boo-boo
Yeah, pause, little pussy, I'm the cable man
Flow direct, your ho I wreck, horse dick stable man
Black Trump, nigga, with fat pockets
Crooked like Jesse Jackson in a black watching
Broke niggas with rich whores
Run off in the Hamptons, sawed-off and get yours
Homies rock the freshest since AJ Lester's
Cooling on Orchard, buying shoes and vest-es
Why pretending who in it? Yo, we winning, y'all sent it
I post in the Ghost, the German Lugers is spitting
Pocket full, rock the wool, Chevys'll stop the bull
Raising the gauge, ramming his cocky wolves
Lefrac, Yonkers, and Staten wolves
Niggas take massive pulls, so now we blast and them bastards move








Aint no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
Im on the edge, so why you playing? Im saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing Ive foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down


Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin for the love of ballin
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that its random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I wont be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?


Aint no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
Im on the edge, so why you playing? Im saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down


Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as Im in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldnt sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jump shot, running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the Worlds game, this is my Olympics
We make em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!


Aint no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
Im on the edge, so why you playing? Im saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down


I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said take them glasses off and get in the pool
Its been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I dont believe in yesterday
And whats a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like Im sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it Im coming after whoever who has it
Im coming after whoever. Who has it?
You blowin' up, thats good, fantastic
That yall, it's like that y'all
I dont really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls


Aint no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
Im on the edge, so why you playing? Im saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down


I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you cant live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye


Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly dripping away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down




25 to life, aiyo Scram Jones, I'm hearing about you kid
What up, let's pop these niggas heads the fuck off, man
It's on still, fuck that, let's do it!


Let the lead jet, mad chunks of ice on his headset
Pull out them cannons, and let my nigga bed check
Always at war, with good liquor, say something hood rich
Bitch, I'm guarded by them good ninjas
Fresh out them caves of Europe, more slave bengals
Flooded like the stone mizurics
So when you see us, nigga wouldn't knee us
The world's most powerful rap duos, run through like zebra's
Big v's pull up, melt ya skull, grab your whore
We're in your ear, yellin' 'war' when we pull up
Eight eight killas, sorta like the bullocks
The wolf child, lift niggas faster than sit-ups
So many stick-money gettas, payin' fly Hitlers
This is all made from the pictures
Automatic exchanges, bad boom killas and rangers
Violate me, you'll die in the rain, bitch


"You got guns, got guns too"
"Watch me -- shit ain't a game, recognize the G"
"You got guns, got guns too"
"Off seasons, I keeps it gully"
"You got guns, got guns too"
"Cowards in the face, the bullets is burning, actual factual"
"You got guns, got guns too"
"It's going down like that"


When I write, floods occuring, arks get built
Prophets kneel the crosses, and presidents killed
Churches, synagogues, even mosses filled
Popes and bishops bow down, on one knee they kneel
Streets is talking, e pills shipped in a coffin
Egyptian jewelry, made the dead rise of the tombs
Aborted babies, re-appeared back in the womb
Used to fuck with all types of thugs, all types of drugs
Strapped up, macked up, with all types of slugs
Militant Che Guerrera, three quarter chinchilla
Ask around about the God, homey say I'm the realest
2-5, we gon' ride til the government kill us
Banana clip in the mack, where niggas act gorilla
The truth is, I'm on some more new and improved shit
Spitting the revolution, allow me to introduce it
I'm legendary, skills in the art of war vary
I feel I'm needed, like the Knicks need Marbury
When I squeeze have the d's go down like the Ferry
Holding my hand, talk to the dead, in cemetaries
That's word to the pain and the blood stain of a dope fiend vein
Leave our mark on the planet, you know we came
Slugs flying, we riding, I ain't doing no bids
Fight a lion with a pocket knife, to feed my kids...






See we gotta have it
Me and my niggas here to lay you down
Ain't playing, so hit the floor
And don't make no fucking sound
We gotta have it
We move just like the mob, do
This game is real, caps get peeled
Fuck around, I'll have to murk you


Yo, from cocktails, 3-80's with the M-1, we bury the jewelry store
Posting, yelling 'get yours', we on Pivot
Coke pilot mink, Kay Gatling Island, Trini and Chi
All day gangsta, murda niggas, sleep
We at the red light, mapped 'em, drove through, as all block
Caught they attention, I leaned
Time Magazine with my face on it, how we position the CREAM
Niggas is large, they all start scheming
Whatever, truck 'em in them leathers, we was stuck together
Fuck around and have to shoot off fingers, yo
You know it, approach the glass with the maskes on
No time for freeze, just pull out and blast on 'em
Sat back, Denzel status, Man on Fire
Had the burner with the flash on it
Skated with six hundred and cash, he did the dummy
We splashed 'em, then boat it in a CLS glass, we vicious




Come one, I see my cash is getting low
And if I can't shake no dough, what the fuck am I living for
It's easy for my heater, just to let these niggas know
At the same time, I will take mines to persue to my cash flow
You know you gotta be sick with it
Call up my mans, cuz we about to go get it
A hundred grand is you wit it, a smash for the cause
Looting to the spot, putting everybody on pause
Let me see a broke jaw, nigga, I want it all
I'm talking to all of ya'll, don't get it, you gon' fall
Or fuck it, you gon' crawl, my nigga, we laying law
We cock back the strap, attack and shake it off




Glocks'll get at you, and body your position
In this rap, fire my ratchet, I'm shutting this rap
Caddy steel, face the back, or blown the fuck off from rap
Reach across and blow this shit out your boss in the back
Survived in a porsche, I rap, at a buck 80 verse
Or verse, daddy, let's do it for change
I'm forty eight hundred grams, one chain, the trend, a new range
Or any project bench, with all my shit on
Flashy don, Gucci on uptowns
Fucking up classics, gay baskets, D.H. niggas
Won't snitch for shit, criminals that spit
Oh shit, I forgot all about you man, twenty and change
Ferocious tongues, coming at you, redirecting your whole shit
Blunt stole, dealing sick
Glocks'll blow chunks out your face, looking up in the sky
Seeing Ol' Dirty's face in the cloud






1,2, 1,2, yo check this out, it's the jump off right now
I want everybody, to put your work down, put your guns down
And report to the pit, the gravel pit
Leave your problems at home, leave your children at home
We gon' take it back underground, I be Bobby Boulders
Wu-Tang Clan on yo' mind one time
It's the jump off, so just jump off my nigga


Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it


Ha, holocaust from the land of the lost
Behold the pale horse, off course (off course)
Follow me, Wu-Tang gotta be
The best thing since Starks and Clark Wallabees
African killer bees blackwatch
On your radio, blowin out yo' watts
From Park Hill, the house on haunted hill
Every time you walk by your back get a chill
Let's peel, who want to talk rap skills
I spit like a semi-automatic to the grill
Elbow grease, and elbow room
Baby play me, baby fall down, go boom
Party people gather round, count down to apocalypse
(I'm the kid with the golden arms)
And I'm the motherfuckin hott nikks pass the blunt
My nigga don't front
You had it for a minute but it seem like a month
Now I'm chokin, smokin, hopin
I don't croakin, from overdosin
Hey, kid, walk straight, master your high
Wu and Meth got you open (open), let's ride
Can't stand niggas that floss too much
Can't stand Bentleys they cost too much
Kid wanna get up then kid get touched
Kid wanna stick up then kid get stuck
I'm the one that called your bluff
When your boy tried to act tough
Remember what Ol' Dirty said: "I'll fuck yo' ass up!"
Now listen


Back, back and forth and forth


E with the English, extinguish styles extremist
Bald head beamers run wild
It's the kid with the gold cup
Stepped out like what
What's poppin, and y'all niggas dobo
Blastin shae shae, chocolate shortae
Rich color mocks, rock those all day
1960 shit I'm Goldie
That's right motherfucker don't hold me
The world's greatest, Las Vegas, paid as rock
Skin painted on my face look ageless
Perfect combos, Ghost bang out condos
Jeff from Hamo, ex three bangos
Bancos, stank hoes in plain clothes
Change those, bang those, same old, same old


Yeah y'all, straight up this the jump off right here
The gravel pit, word up represent, rock the boulders
All my rich gangsta style, killers, y'all know what time it is
Shorty do your thing, get up on that shit right now boo, do you
That's what I'm talkin 'bout


Yo, step to my groove, move like this
When we shoot the gift of course it's ruthless
Grab the mic with no excuses
In a sec, grab the Tecs and loot this
Executing, shaking all sets, and I'm breaking all hecks
I'm taking all bets, move all best, who want the dram' next
You all stank, we got the bigger bank
Bigger shank to fill your tank
Still the same kill you for real, while you crank
Slide, do or die, fry to bake
Admire the greats, on fire wit a heart of hate
Bitter shark, every part I take, heavy darts that quake
It's okay, all fakes, get caught by the dropkicks
You know the thrill, yes it's Park Hill
Yo we hit 'em with the hot grits
On the go, check the flow, saying Wu don't rock shit
Stop quick, hold the gossip, stop sweating my pockets
I hear the hot shit


Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it
You don't have to move a mountain
Just give me enough strength to climb
Oh Lord ! Don't take away my stumbling vows
And lead me a round


Yakub, maker and creator of the devil. Swine merchant... your time is near at hand. Fuck with me and your time will be now. Your presence here effects the mind of my people like a fever. You, Yakub, are the bearer of nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine diseases, evil, corrupt, porkchop-eatin' brain!




Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
The special technique of shadowboxing


Poisonous, poisonous (word word word)
I should slap all y'all niggas for coming in my fucking face with that shit
Alright cool yeah, go ahead man...
Poisonous


Poisonous paragraphs smash your phonograph in half
It be the Inspectah Deck on the warpath
First class leaving mics with a cast
Causing ruckus like the aftermath when guns blast
Run fast, here comes the verbal assaulter
Rhymes running wild like a child in a walker
I scored from the inner slums abroad
And my thoughts are razor sharp, I sliced the mic from the cord
First to criticize, but now they have become
Mentally paralyzed with hits that I devise
Now I testify, the rest is I
Rebel INS Your Highness, blessed to electrify
With voltage of a eel, truth that I reveal
Will crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real
Caesar black down, hoodied up in fatigues
Part time minor leagues receive third degrees
Attack like a wolf pack once I pull back
The God-U and bust through like a fullback


Yo, you fourteen carat gold slum computer wizard
Tapping inside my rap vein causes blizzards
The wildlife that kills for ice trife like by the digits
Gorillas injected with strength of eighty midgets
The Earth spins, whirlwinds, rap exotic blends
Let my peeps in, niggas gasping, swallowing aspirins
With a dosage, you overdosed in rap
High explosives, my posters hypnotize with hypnosis
I sell goods, my whole Clan is on the run like Natural Born Killers
Record-breaking the album Thriller
Got access to tear gas, bombs and rocket launchers
Flow like dough, Killa Beez is what I sponsor
Your entrepreneur, pens in gear like Shakespeare
When I fuck I grab hair, collect drawers as souvenirs
Fuck yeah, my crew down German beers
My career's based on guns, throwing cats in wheelchairs
Etcetera, damage any lame ass competitor
Who try to front, get broken in fast like leathers
Whatever hot hardheads get shattered like mirrors
Beretta shots splatter your goose, scatter your feathers
Say never poetry chumps crumbs deal with graphic
Flew my family overseas, I'm maxing
If rap was crack, fully packed I be tall cats
Taxing kingpin of the rap drug trafficking
Village niggas get slapped in Manhattan
For rapping, Big Ghost steps off laughing
Ha!


Were you just using the Wu-Tang school method against me?
I've learned so many styles, forgive me


Sit back relax, fake niggas don't get turns
Watch me massage your brain with slang that's king
Projects filled with young men cause threats
Who has that? Thousand dollar chains and Tecs
Focus, the brokest niggas of life shit
These mics is like cocaine son, check the suicidal hype shit
Exchange mad blunts taste the sweepstakes
Keeping up on fakes outta state for cakes
No doubt, plus nobody amount, we making dough off
Putting fifty on the Land and Allah, it's like that
Pull ya shoes up black, matter of fact just adapt
Tie up, your black Nikes and tight hats
Corners stay surrounded with foreigners
What up, dread? Feds caught your bredren for his bread
But regardless, peace to jail niggas with charges
Unify laying in the yard with La
My Clan done ran from Japan to Atlanta with stamina
Slingers and gamblers and gram handlers
Tical light the Owl cigar, let's get steamed
Infra-red guard your beam, so seek 'nough respect
Rude bwoy you bet, keep it moving Mashallah
Pro black like tar
Designing the fly shit and stay shining
The RZA pour more beats than Cristal's fine wine
Concrete raps go to bat
With 50 other niggas on the other side of the map
Knew it's all good and all done what, we want son
Mike Tyson of this rap shit, pulling out Macs for fun


The nigga don't get mad, I got mad styles of my own
And it's shown when my hands grip the chrome microphone
Verbally I catch bodies with cordless shotties
Intriguing MCs, I keep em trained like potties
I bomb facts, my sword is an axe
To split backs invisible, like dope fiend tracks
Sky's the limit, niggas are timid and nobody knows
How we move like wolves in sheep clothes
Producing data, microchips of software
Underground and off air
The Land of the Lost, notorious henchman from the North
Striking niggas where the Mason-Dixon line cross




Get it burn it, get it burn it
Get it burn it, get it burn it
Get it burn it, get it burn it
Get it burn it, get it burn it
(The gun'll go, the gun'll go..., the gun'll go...)


Aiyo, one thing for sure, keep you of all
Keep a nice crib, fly away, keep to the point
Keep niggas outta ya face, who snakes
Keep bitches in they place, keep the mac in a special place
Keep moving for papes, keep cool, keep doing what you doing
Keep it fly, keep me in the crates
Cuz I will erase shit, on the real, note, you'se a waste
It's right here for you, I will lace you
Rip you and brace you, put a nice W up on ya face
Word to mother, you could get chased
It's nothing to taste, blood on a thug if he gotta go
All I know is, we be giving grace
This is a place, from where we make tapes
We make 'em everywhere, still in all, we be making base
Y'all be making paste, these little niggas, they be making shapes
Our shit is art, yours is traced


This is the way that we rolling in the streets
You know when we roll we be packing that heat
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go...


This is, Poverty Island, man, these animals don't run
Slums where the ambulance don't come
Who got the best base? Fiends waiting to smoke some
Approach something, ask him where he getting that coke from
My dudes hug blocks like, samurai shogun
Cause no V and no ones, equaling no fun
Who want to treat they nose, huh? Body'll go numb
My woman need funds, plus her hair and her toes done
It is what it is though, you fuck with the kid flow
That make it hard to get dough, the harder the kid go
Harder the piff blow, harder when it snow
The pinky and the wrist glow, this here, what we live for
Get gwop, then get low, but first thought
We gotta get the work off, the gift and the curse, boss
Yeah, see I'm the shit yo, the dirt in the fit, no
Hustling from the get-go, the motto is get more


This is the way that we rolling in the streets
You know when we roll we be packing that heat
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go...


We was quiet flashy brothers, strapped all along
With the dirty .38 long, twelve hour shift gate
Took case, state to state, you think he won't hold his weight?
Put ya money on the plate and watch it get scrapped
We get ape up in that club, off that juice and Henn
And it's a no win situation fucking with them
You mean like Ewing at the front at the rim, finger roll a Dutch
Million dollar stages touched, techs, gauges bust
Trust no one, the lone shogun, rugged Timb boot stomper
Damaging lyrical mass destruction launcher
Nothing can calm the quakeage when I break, kid
Peace to my brothers up north, doing state bids


This is the way that we rolling in the streets
You know when we roll we be packing that heat
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go...


Whoa... this is the way we be rolling in the club
You know when we roll we be packing .32 snubs
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go


Get it burn it...





Being transported to a new and separate reality



Now watch how Im flipping things
Im the man behind the scene pulling the puppet strings
Married to the rap game without a diamond ring
Keep it a hundred percent authentic, Im not a a ringtone
Rapper thats candy apple super sweet
My flow filthy like gutter water on dirty streets
Bang on the machines and bang out a beat
Get fans out of the seats, wake people that are sleeping out of their dreams
Cant tell where I cut it, theres no seams
Back like I got a score to settle, Im on another level
I stutter step with the pebble just like the running rebels
Fuck the current direction of rap, Im the exception
40 cake, records raw with no protection while a chain swing
Name of the beast gangrene, make Gs, money like hoes
No chasing em, I make em chase me, custodian of streets I sweep
Drama king when it come to this music its not a thing
I radiate, next to the Sun Im the hottest thing on the planet
Hands dirty from working like a mechanic
Under the hood, animal Im up to no good



For anybody that dont understand
Underestimate the class wont pass like an undergrad
Under that I reign like thunderclaps
Storm through like Tom Clancy without a gat
But the team strapped make niggas ease back
Spit raw uranium, yall dont wanna see that
Radioactive to radios active
My radius is massive, radiate classic
Material, ride, bang in my stereo
Youre looking for the the real ?
Here we go, gangrene, cut off the bad limbs
Back to some mad men madness
? the mathematics
Mic the masterful back at it
With ALC, even his fiends wanna get a crack at it
Like crack addicts deep addiction is like black magic
But this fresh and the cars more damaged
Cause we more savage, a beast with more patterns
Than patches on the front and back of some old jackets
From the old Jacksons its the newest ?
Rollers wishing to see whats happening



Explosive bullets most will fall off in your wholesome hoodie
Sit there staring in your eye, toast of Phillie
? rhyme with Big Willie
? the hood brother
Spit phlegm, jumped in, we knowing the hitmen
Every other optional flow gets the clip then
Blow for a second, be back and then come get men
Clap cleaner all my ratchets Wolverine screener
? my inner beam will flow chemo
Rap made ? assed in greeno
Greenish, bitch driving Filipino
Gun in your mouth, dont laugh at me
Dont even laugh with me, got 40 clips and a staff with me




Four-four's and gauges, top locks get blown off hinges
Divide twenty into one sixty, vision of inches
Spinnin out the hood into larger homes
Sex tales and Motorola phones, roamin the world
DVD's paint my life on a thousand inch screens
Watch the pinches, all trip's and falls, rise through winter
I went from stubborn, thug and broke, now I'm wise and richer


The game is a novel, bulletproof goggles and bitches
Yo, Lord, just watch and make sure keep floodin ya watches
Plannin the crib, marinate, delegate gigs
I'm the old nigga feedin Goldie
Yo I sware on my life, and yours too, cousin
The old niggas be holdin, yo chill on the bezels
Gettin big on all levels
Niggas is watchin, money come from most of the Devils
I seen that televised moment
Aiyo son, you dropped 'em, now you gotta move like a Roman


Some say the good die young (Why's that?)
Cuz the hood where I'm from, you either duck strays or toke macks
(Squeeze rounds 'til them hammers sit back)
{You now rollin in the arms of vets}


I'm straight, snorkels on the grind, block reclinin benches
The first time I heard C.R.E.A.M. I hit the block harder
Twenties of this, fifties of that, duckin
Dodgin, weavin, deletin cracks
Loc'd out off the tombs of Beth', we move in many forms
Pimps hit the floor and sell strap
My only fear of you frail cats
Cuz when I squeeze, D.A.'s and judges, don't get a bail back


So steel's ya color, that's real, build wit ya brothers
You'se a young nigga, fresh out, Amil's ya mother
And yea the police is definitely workin
They got they hats on, backwards son, slanted style
Hurtin niggas, that nigga right there tell him
I heard his family whisperin shit, he snitchin on all the fellas
That made him glamp like he larger
Fuck it, Benzes is weak, we buyin solitaries






You have to learn mercy
Otherwise, you will learn bad ways
You have been confined here, for one month already
But you still haven't grasped this basic principle
I feel sorry for you, my boy


I've been living in this world
Not knowing where I'm going (knowing where I'm going)
This world ain't showing
That it's gonna get better, better (yeah, it's gonna be trouble again)


My days getting shorter, my nights getting longer
My cell getting smaller, my son getting taller
I exercise my mind, my body getting stronger
But my blood getting colder, heart getting harder
My chances for appeal, getting slimmer
My skin getting brighter, my hair getting thinner
See, when you stressed out, you could age fast in here (have mercy)
I done seen weak niggas not last a year, so before lights out
I write my kids every night, kiss the stamp on the kite
And say a prayer, I hope it lands safe in this flights
I pray they sleep safe through the night
Try to teach my son right, give him some jewels
But it's hard to raise my boy from this visiting room
Many cells turned to prisoner's tombs
I just pray I don't die in here, and last night I almost cried a tear
(have mercy)


To all my gun holders, stand up, get it
Cuz when the killas come around, it's on
Bullets get blown, warn 'em and they re-up fast
Say some back shit, your flagship gone
Can't play the building no more
Can't hang around by the store no more
It's really on, you a dickhead
Now you a dead man with no hand
Now you can't believe you jammed


Between my six niggas, sixty years, stay in the crispy airs
Hundreds, blunted, we up top, switching lairs
Money equal power, horror equal real when borrowed
Ratchet barrel under your ears
Mean streets in the middays, they robbers, but life's so hard
Even the cops clutter us to starve us (have mercy)
The killas is star struck, look at the cars and trucks
Rambo guns, it's hard to get luck
Whether fail or a come up, your number is up
Period, make you bleed Caesarean
Chop through your body, leave you right in the lobby
Hear me, kid? Extra holes right in your derriere
The blitzes, the rushes'll touch something, back in the cells
Two days later, yup, back in them cuffs again
Or leaning on the customers, hustlers, my hood illustrious
Marvelous raps, screw on mufflers (have mercy)




Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh
It hurts my heart, to see what's going on
Young men dying now, children going when they're born
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh whoa
Oh no, oh whoa, where is this world going to? I don't know



Fuck that shit Raekwon
Do that shit
Fuck them niggas...

Whats up playboy
Nigga, you doing you're thing
Nigga, go ahead

Chorus: 
Yeah, them fake duels
Any real niggas baby make moves
Pay dues, bitches who relate rock shoes yo
Damn, them niggas stay frontin
Tryin' to hollywoodize the realness
But ain't sayin nothin


Yo, bagel material, contact Merial kid
She sling cell weight, bust gun material
Fast like splash and rice, stash your wife
Curry, chicken, and bitches crime on my right
I'm marvelous extra large
Threw y'all faggot niggas in the game
And now y'all niggas ain't feelin ours
Love is a message from my family
Cream Team Incorporated, Wu-Tang Clan is what you plan to be
Oh yeah, ladies in here, say yeah
Do it like yeah, starvin niggas fake rocks in they ears
Black down hat with the beak up, unique what
You need to stop wilin, the fam won't speak up
Toast, the most official niggas on post
Yellin out "how ya nigga Ghost," rich he supposed
Now I'm just talkin this one
Don't make me diss one paw
Its all about enterprisin and get rich son
Steal a nigga yo, collect currency yo
Could lock a bank up, IRS can suck dick straight up
Had dosche, oil of olay, play nigga lay
??? a cheap shit, crush them niggas like clay
Van Damn hammers, 2000 Jaguar, cameras
The little shit, seeing what you're plan was
Made y'all niggas go platinum
I made y'all niggas flow happen
Lets battle for cash captain
Remember, the cold giant on the set
Lyin on you're dick, play for real take it care of'ya ex
Thats right I'm hungry, this go out to y'all alumni
Faggot niggas dead wrong
Yeah, I'm player hatin, waitin
The culture of this nation
You lay Bay Boy since '88, stop leanin on me
Turnin iceberg money into laundry
Been taught a whole country
This technician bash opponents
Flow is llike Ronin, the movie
My gun blew your store up
Allah you our god, translating peace to the god
Lewis Rich slash signatures on the credit card
Me, Bird, Binkie, Santana, bad with the hammer
My dun power through a hundred grand up
Words from the Martin Luther King version
We burn versus then send 'em out Fed Ex, fast service

Chorus


The tailor made king of New York
Designer walk, Prince of Wales
Hundred sales stock broke and hotels
Playa hyply, them niggas dislikin me
Challenge my style politely, thats like fightin whitey
Here we go again lord, climb aboard
Stevie Wonder award
From here to UK, movin on your broad
Speak through Ninex, go ahead and rhyme next dun
Runnin up on nine vets, minds rep, we run your projects
All greenery on, see on lights, movin like Deion
The eagle on plus scream on all y'all bitches
The Blair Witch rich nigga vision, comprehension
Listen, its called slang optimism
Connect dots, niggas is large you can't see us
Y'all select cops, screamin niggas bars on your drops yo
Damn, what the world became of
A nigga buy a chain and he think he a thug
Here drink a slug (*ppppsssshhhh*)
Major niggas call it, y'all niggas is like a bar
I'm the war wick paw, straight up assorted
Yo, just a bark from the tree of life
Niggas ain't eatin right
Give 'em a taste and let 'em see the light

Chorus: Repeat x3


...Ain't sayin nothin






My life, day one when I was caught up in it young
Benetton sweaters, Kangols and guns
The candy shop is where it all popped
Sellin' ounces of oregano, free lunch, the spot
Thinkin' all better, can't wait to bag this block
Cause when I get on, my ass is just rock
Do a few 1-2s and shop
I get whore who's runnin' through 5th Ave, a Glock
I love Polo Gear and top
A few Woolrich pieces, yeah the  was hot
Dreams and schemes to make a knot
I sat on the stove and wrote "C.R.E.A.M.," one blunt 2 o'clock
Gangsta hours if I'm not
I'm lyin', take a shot, I put it on my 40K rock
Shorty with an educated bop
With flavor for days, it's all praise, who amaze you a lot

 x2
Front out of drug buildings under the street lights
Guns go off, we keep pipes
Every kid caught in the zone, let's hope he make it home
And sleep right, instead of churnin' the heat night


Ayo maxin' with the machine guns, new 
Tryna stay away from the jail gangs and letters
My time is now, bread box is startin' to pile
Homegirl got no style but I'ma lace her
Catch me in a Blazer with a P9 laser
Drunk get 25 thousand a razor
Meet me in the mess hall, you crazy, I'm out in Jamaica
Breakin' up black weed, chillin' with gangstas
Fuck around high, might die on vacation
Better have respect in the right place like Mike Mason
Everybody smooth when the cake flip
Niggas start snitchin' on the team whe they say shit
Get your face lit, it's so hard to make shit
Can't sit around jealous niggas, that's gay shit
That's why, yo I'm just around paid shit
No Minute Maid shit, no son this ain't a slave ship

 x2




Hang glide for my nigga Tical
Yo, word to God we run this whole shit Son (no doubt)
Right that's my word, guaranteed you're dealing with the invincible (no doubt)
(I'm specialized in swordsmanship)
That's my word, Persian Legacy one time, one time
That's the science of the black man
Stationary niggas, have fun on this right here
Yo Shorty cross your arms
Gonna rock niggas to sleep this year (throw your leather up)


Blade thrower, sword swinga, killa bee ringer
Rocky road roll dark greener
Cream fademas, name your God-U Kareema
Shout out Medina, federaloes Noxzema
Me, jewelery cleaner Million Man March screamers
Ray Catena, cut your joint Wolverine
The Longines, wrapped around the wrist, law seen her
How I got that yo, threw out the macker named Gina
Bust a shot, seen her, it richocheted, tapped Tina
Now I'm out, lampin in Korea with Talima
We moseyin, sweatsuit Adidas, best believe
I got the black heater little joint, probably Moschino
Yo Bobby Robby whattup, Max tried to follow me
Sadaam loungin, clean up collect, like the laundry
It's time yo swerve like the Nike line
Windbreaker Laker throw a jump shot scrape her
Statuary yo floatin that snatch-uary
Aiyyo, blow a hole in your limo, weed pass the dutch


Yo this is MC wizardry, killa bee invasion
Men of respect, blessed with wisdom of the ancients
My words are blatant, lacerate necks for statements
I launch like lead projectiles, straight out the basement
I suplex your rep, left ruined like the Aztecs
Parasites, double edge dice your larynx
My hip-hop, is quarantined locked inside the detox
Under key lock, it's like b-block and E-Glocks
You're ill, your trail ends, thoughts are frail
I strike the cypher, and let one survive to tell the tale
Of my state of grace, I raise the stakes on snakes
Knock em off like the big eights for takin up space
Never did fear em, stick em with the truth serum
Who sent em, arrest em before my charge is ended
Designated hitter flows split the transistor
Kinetic globes light when it shine, burns your retina
Urban journal, plus eternal broadcaster
Before and after, I be Self Lord And Master


I be the Ironside, get touched, with the chloride
Take walk with the Nine-Finger bandits worldwide
Shaolin hillside, full of homicides
FUCK you dissatisfied the double dyed black brown iodine


Yo, box talk sequence, powerhouse kickout
Eyes dusty, wet, butt-naked with my dick out
I'm direct, golden best, golden chest is blessed
Scarce chapter, snatch a batch of Winterfresh
It sound farfetched, mountain men that be rich
You get buckshot, dummy-clapped, mummy-wrapped and stitched
The Jeffrey Dahmer Notre Dame-r sing the song the strongest
Brute force bullethole straight through your chorus
Shank you with the think tank, harmony cake cut
A can of ass-whoopin', Flurry shake break, you fucks
Struck, love crooks, why for lyin hooks
Chef cocaine cook, a marvelous book
This deathbed doctrine, paper for the youth
What remains, a saber-toothed tiger in the booth


Last night, I took a trip down to Crown Heights
Fast life, females are trife, stay tight
I detect that parasite, satellite
RZA beat makes me wanna fight get hyped, come to do shows
My slang sound write secretary type
Backflip on the mic, I'm the poor black man
Workin hard for the grand, I understand clear
Don't fear, peep my new gear it's different from yours
My style drop like drawers, you see me on tours
Don't you wait to say peace, the kid from the street
Put my technology on the track, just then the core attack
Wu article, Cappa, five, CD attack
But my talk stage live killa beehive
Bermuda my life angle, rectangle gold fronts
Bring the gold bangle, never make me throw darts
Check out my arts, when I release my smarts
Hot like Pop Tarts, aim me at the charts




Fire in your face
Time to take these streets again you heard
No more playing man, I want it. (Chef)


It was a Friday everybody was caken'n
And the house was shake'n and the beats was bang'n
And it won't be long that everybody know'n
That DJ brought the heat rocks
That DJ brought the heat rocks
That DJ brought the heat rooooocckks


(Let's go) Come, Get some, You little bum
I bake the cake but you can't get a crumb
From, Get physical, Lyrical, Spiritual
Ultimate, And all that good shit
I love brag'n, Gots to rag it, Flash the dragon
Back in nine-five with the wagon
Create drama when I hunt for cream
And I pack em in mean, My sweet sixteen
Is fly, My vibe is live, I gots to ride
A smoke a bone you know it when Cochise died
Hell up in Harlem, Note to Staten
When niggas do hits rock sixes black man
The black brand, Wu-Tang Clan, I smack hands
Then drive through the Hammerstein, Fronts and black bands
Cool'n, School'n, Everything around me
Might fire one off in clique's around me
I won't stand it, Dammit, Murder the planet
I more like a sign man, My coke just landed
You know, Get money nigga, The fly poet
Who only write rhymes and the track exploded


Ayo, Come see me man, Come see me I'm back up baby
Whatever you need, Come on man, Word up
Don't bring no people I don't know man




Back again, Son put the fronts back in
Fresh like a new wash or glass of gin
I got many kins ready to hit niggas
Plenty men, Blend with a new spaceship, That's what's in
Caught a whirl when Shallah shit drop
Crys pop, Got Barrack with me, Come get me, Ashy Glock
You know it's cool even if I flop
Ain't no more real niggas left I just sit in the box
With all the fliest, Livest, Multi-buyers
Niggas eat money up, Most yall liars
Catch the kid in Hawaii tired
New-New Roll, You talking to my ho you fired
Superstar Keyon quite
When I talk got every burroughs in a smash cause I am
The greatest, Pay this, Latest, Famous painters say this
Two more strong for your play list
New Yorker, Hulker, Call me Orca
Army jacket down to the floor I soak you up
This is a master classic rap shit
Play at five in the morning, Get the gun and mask kit
Smoke like an Indian, Pass it

No one can fuck with the Wu-Tang


Yo what what, yo
Exotic type shit
Ninety-four, we must go to war fast
With the pen and the pad
Goddamn, shine like gold rims on Pathfinders
Wu-Tang reclines, lamps for the nine-squares kid
(Money, clothes, designer hoes and shows ya'll)


Yo, yo, waking up about ten kid
Jumping in the shower, peace about to make
(Moves and slide like grease)
What, I'm all about Tecs and checks with nuff respect
You front, I'm slamming you like the Lex
So now I'm out in the ninety-five
Rocking that real nigga don't die
Guess down, (Drawers Kani)
But yo, I'm making a pit stop
Go and buy a box of Glocks, he rolled up and yo
(Whattup 'Ak)
(Yo, remember that kid that we vicked
He made a half of mil for real
He brought about four bricks)
Yo, so now we connect thoughts
Meet me at the airport
{Tell Golden Arms maintain the fort}
(Get in touch with that west coast Cali crab you stabbed
And meet me at the bitch lab)
So word up kid, we slid like a fat four to twelve bid and shit
(Couldn't even rest, I need the vic)
And when I slept, I dream Gs, son I need some
(Keys won't sell, call up Son)
I heard Pook and Tyriq caught a beef over some real shit
(A fake nigga faked and they killed his clique)
Gimme a minute and I'm with it
(Yo, niggas done did it), rock your vest
(Keep your whip tinted)
(So now we see him up in Bojangles strangling a forty ounce
With ten Gs worth of gold bangles)
Diamonds, what, all up in his face
(With his man's mace), medallions (the size of dinner plates)
Yo, he knew we knew him so we blew him
Took thirty G's worth of jewels off that nigga {Do him}
(So now I'm lamping in my man's Land)
Streets is hot like sand
(G's is rolling in my right hand)
Yup, you know the steez all-black
Got to go down like that, (Shallah)
Cigars and {ball hats}
Ninety-four, taking niggas to war, yo, yo


What do you believe in, heaven or hell?
You don't believe in heaven cause we're living in hell
{What do you believe in, heaven or hell?
You don't believe in heaven cause we're living in hell}
So it's your life
(What a chamber, fucking with mad strangers
Yeah, you know how it runs baby, straight up yo
Money, clothes, designer hoes and shows y'all
That's how it goes, whatever)

Yo, what it is man? What's going on man? Come on man


She dissed me when she walked out the door
She kissed me, Louis luggage on the floor
Gazing, plus the room was misty
I felt a slight urge telling me to wisen up
I can't previse her, she dead in the right, the don's a jiver
I lost my most powerful piece, my queen
Broke her heart in sixty six ways for some bitches and schemes
The only thing she left was a rose, and left the Rolls in front of the building
Now how the fuck my pain get exposed, damn
What happened man?


We don come to a point where it can't be denied no more
I don't even understand what we're still in this for
I didn't mind the sacrifice to keep our love alive
But something died so long ago, just can't be revived
There comes a time you gotta face the situation and make a choice in life
We're caught up in a state of hesitation, and that just won't suffice
Don't get me wrong, I done thought this through, yeah
The way you hold me used to console me
Now all I feel is the emptiness in you


What do you believe in, heaven or hell?
I don't believe in heaven cus we're living in hell and that's my life
With you


Yeah, listen to me
You sing my praises everyday, you used to tell me how you needed me
I know how proud you were that day I brought home my degree
But you had dreams and all I wanted was for you to see them through
And through it all I forgot that I once had dreams too
I should have had the sense to pay attention, cause someone told me to
The road to hell is paved with good intentions, and Lord knows it's true
The years that I gave, were they all in vain?
Used to adore me, now you ignore me
How could I know we would end up this way?




What hurts me most, deep inside
Now that I'm letting go, you seem surprised
I wanted you back for oh so many years now
You used to act like you were holding your career down
It's not the dreams I kiss goodbye
It's that we used to be a team and I lived this lie
What's past is past, now listen well
I'm leaving your ass, gonna meet you in hell




(That's my life) You know what I'm saying? It's all good
Word up, The Chef, you know how I go
Joy, Joy Joy, whatup, one love baby, hold it down



Zanyx:
Is there a god shit there must be /
Cause where else would we come from monkeys? /
I really don't know what to fucking believe in /
I'm confused from all the different information I'm receiving / the question is , is all the stories from the bible true?/
Or is it a myth like Budah and the Greek gods too/
Should I follow god or should i follow Zeus /
I have no clue idk what tf i should do /
If god talked to people back then / why won't he do it again to help us believe in him / I ask him questions but never get a reply / is it all a lie does someone really live in the sky?/
Or did the government write the bible /
To get more money is it just a business cycle / it's the most selling book of all time / but if it's from god why would they even charge a dime?/ It's basic instructions before life ends /
But if the world ended before why would he make it again?/
Does he just wanna see us suffer and die /
Or are we all just fucking living a lie / why are there so many other religions /
There's even a couple that involves killing /
They say Jesus christ died for our sins / but yet we still have it in the world we're living in /
Nobody's ever met god or heard his voice / but yet they say they hear him talking and feel rejoice / what if this is all bullshit /
If the fucking government wrote it they're fucking full of it /
I believe in god but I have my doubts /
I don't know what religion is really about / to me it's man made it doesn't say a religion in the bible it's all fake /
And why are Jewish people the chosen ones / I thought it was wrong to have favoritism /
I'm not a preacher shit I'm hardly a believer /
I just want y'all to think about the shit y'all hear /
Don't just believe in what ever people say /
Unless you can clearly see proof in front of your face /
If you have faith I'm not saying dont believe /
Just think about all the information that you receive and is it really what you need /
But you should know we're living in hell until our souls are freed 
Until we take our last breath until we fucking leave /





Ayo I stabbed her in the mouth
And said peace you know I love you
Meet me in the park, lets park

Hoping and praying

Hey love
You're my one true soul desire
Hey love, baby

And I stand there waiting, yeah
But girl, you just walk on by

Say love
With a cold heart you are dealing
Hey love, yeah
It's an awful hurting feeling

Hey love

Just look me over, yeah
You might want to change your mind




I love you so.. never gonna let you go baby
I love you so.. never gonna let you go baby


Icewater.. (yeah dedication to my niggas, I love y'all)


I remember back when, a nigga first started rapping
Wu-Tang was the main attraction
Rae and Ghost was the illest team
Deck did his thing on C.R.E.A.M
Meth made you wanna smoke weed
Dirt and Uey, spit with SWV
I used to rock Cuban Linx and go and double my cheese
Duckin' the D's, RZA was the Prince Rakeem
So peace to the whole Clan and thanks for everything


Yo, it's hip hop/rap, let's take it back, 1986
When MC Shan, Marley Marl, niggas rocked the bridge
I watched video hot tracks on T.V
Kool Moe Dee, Big Daddy Kane, down to Biz Markie
Remember UTFO and The Real Roxanne?
"Eric B. For President" was a classic jam
KRS repped the Bronx, Boogie Down, rap battles threw down
From the roof top to Polo Grounds
I had the big boom box, thumping Scott LaRock
Hip hop was hot, had shorties doing the wop
And my niggas used to break dance to Planet Rock
From doing the pop, spinning on the cardboard box


Aiyo, it seems it's all good, but the block is mean
It's like, hip hop, showed me how to rock my jeans
If it wasn't for this rap game, where would I be?
Gunned down, dead in the streets, or locked in the beast
Yo, when Big died, that's the day the world cried
Peace to Pac and Pun, Aaliyah, we ride
Yo, I wanna take this rap game back to the beginning
Where Run-DMC and Jam Master Jay was spinning
Yo, it wasn't easy, niggas had a harder way
Doc The Roc, he spinning on Harbor's day
It's like, hip hop, showed me how to live my life
My name's Jason, but hip hop named me Lite




Straight money, get a live lad, young seed, color me bad
My wallabees red, the lobby, we would grab niggas
Selling mad smoke with caves on, brushin' my waves
My highway ninjas, fly the sensation
Black trenchers, e gooses, mad looses, come in the booth
Doug E. Fresh and 'em, Rick and them suits
The raw lotto years, switch up the emblem, more color bottles
Gold on a nigga neck, slidin' around cop Gallo
What? Playin' Union Square, chillin' with Ewings who care
My first day, picture me scared
I been to high lite, and anarchy, can't rob me, all in the train
The A, baby boy, blowin' on yard weed
R.C. Tone, K-Fin, J-Gosh
The nigga Rosh, Buddha Rob, Black Chavy and Marsh
Move on, I shout yesterday's dons, God love and respect
I hope your dreams come true, word is bond


When niggas used to be in cyphers I was sittin in the back
Never said nothin, I just used to listen to rap
Wu was still tryin to get on the map
I was a youngin', when I realized that I had a mission in rap
So I grabbed my pen and my pad, gave it everything that I had
I swear I used to sit in the lab
And write all night, niggas used to make me hype
Freestylin in the mirror with a brush as my mic


This is my music, it made me, taught me, raised me
Held me down, 24/7, when I need it from it it gave me
Put me on to the latest gear, put a durag on my hair
Throwback or baseball hat, Air Force One's, an Avirex triple five vex' on my back
This is now but I still remember way back when
When we used to rock Puma's, Gazelles and back spin
Before 106 & Park, they used to throw jams in the park
Cheeba got sparked after dark, twisted in bamboo paper
That was when that battle between KRS-One and MC Shan was major
Kane was raw, what Rakim said on beat was never said before
The streets was hot, on every ghetto on every block
And every radio you walked by was blastin off that real hip hop {*echoes*}





? six or seven years ? into cars and shooting people in the street and you're making 250 dollars a week




Hitman for hire, no escape, chill with all the big plans mcgyver
You diving into quick sand when I will
Lean on you with this heat like a tick stand on fire
Save your hocus pocus no I dont believe in magic
Boy I believe that this ratchet is filled to the tip with talent
When you disappear, got nothing to do with talent
I wave at your top hat, watch you hop around like a rabbit
Voila, yawda, calabunga with shells, treat you like little splinters
Dont fuck around with joell
My burrow start with a b, finish up with a end
And Ill always more be in, every project that I be in
Ask the Spanish housing work cause theyll tell you see that bien
When I clean up in the morning, who be in the lobby hin
Even in the trap Im the king of the boom bap
I snap you get the beats, like Im producing the tracks
Wanna beef on the record, I finish your ass on the wax
Wanna beef off the record, your ass still getting waxed
And I could talk shit, cause your lip will be all split
While your nose is a faucet, and Im watching it all drip


In case they wailing, Ima pop it
Guns is Jason Collins coming out the closet
Its logic, Im working on this project
And I got work up in the projects
Yeah, so its a pioneer, so Ima pioneer
Getting stereo types, sony, pioneer
Im 2 up, I come around flossin
Girls said I blew up, south town boston
They tell rappers fred knives stay away
I spit till Im taped up, lay away
Infrared stay away
Miami could be playing in New York
Couldnt make me put the ray away
Life skill, we could battle
 got a light bill on a barrel
Im involved in mobbin, dont trust it
Your girl is a bird, Ill abduct her
The way I handle, I should be playing it 
Look like you need arrest, go and cuff her


Champagne killers, everything I wear
Niggas bought the same thing killing
Yeah, the movies are more slicker
Lifestyle richer
Rats be in the chair, yellin yeah hell hit you up
Im known to ruin a wake, but still an old ruin to take
You get it, holding mob style me
And sleeping at niemens
Email, send me a seamen
Bitches, cant stop winning its fake
Keep it movingshoot off, shoot horse, carry my plate
Cause when its realer, she weight, gun cock ready to bait
I love em, hug em, get the best of these traits
Rich niggas never get just, thats why they want him away
When everythings closer, its straight
Back to getting money, back in the bay
Back and Im slay




Yo, yeah so you know, word
Them niggas got the shoes up in there son
Na na, hold on, who that over there?


Baby I can bring the heat when it's cold outside
The one you need, baby ride or die
Anything that you can imagine
I can make it happen, only one to hold you down
A good man deserves a good woman
A good woman that'll treat you right
I'm the one to hold you down


Ay yo, come here young lady with the skin of a baby
Who dress like a Wall Street woman, you ?
I know your family, they my people for life
Had a beef behind the wall, one of your cousins, he threw me a knife
But that's yesteryears, life is intact
Been battin', quit rappin'
But I'm just reactin', your body packin'
I know not to ask a woman's age, but it's crazy these days
No time for slipups, the industry is crazy
Bloodhounds chasin' these girls
Girls chasin' these birds, they say whips we see curves
But I need one with knowledge and self
And whole word, say word
Yo hop inside the Aston, put your feet on the fur
Let's talk, put the Birkin in the back by the door
Don't put it on the floor, it's bad luck so don't fold
You've got a strong aura I'm digging this snow ?
I want a boo who gon' give me the business hittin' Guinness with me




Take the keys to the lab, put your ? in the ?
Don't worry 'bout paper, that's afterlife's chapter
We good




Ayo, ayo, ayo, high potency Thai, smoke a bag of black
And feel the vibe, born to be wise, we form on a rise
The corner mean five, horns in disguise, throw on your slides
Young niggas racist, smokers is basing
We seen the eyes laying up, playing the cut, what?
Stay in the truck, something told me duck, folded me up
My shoulders struck out of luck, fucked the Pradas up
Fell in a daze like a Golotta snuff, niggas tried to body me up
I'm in the lobby bleeding, niggas in the waiting office probably eating
And sprinting and beefing when they heard the shots called the precinct
And seen barber nieces beast, some niggas shot Shallah features
And shot through his Ellesses, bent the spinal cordless creatures
I'm gagging and flagging a cab down
Guess who in the Benz wagon, dragging my sound down macking
It was Dale Breedy the greedy, conniving-ass snake genie
Cop with a bikini who murdered charge and benini
I'm feeling wheezy and I'm drained from the cheeba grieving
Ain't even looking decent, seeing police niggas reaching


That splash against my hollow bones
That rocks my...


Fleeing the crime scene speeding
Beefing leaving behind cream, not even peeping that I was leaking
Won't see the precinct just got a recent case beaten
Still jakes are creeping, don't blow your spot, stay the weekend
Keep the Ruger peeling who's squealing few knew the dealings
Keep the steel concealed in cause we got no time for feelings
Eyes on the building guards are on the corners illing
Million dollar block villain plotting on a killing
Feel like, a superhero talking like a true Deniro
They boost his ego found him broke down, reduced to zero
Cops fill reports hoping I'll reveal my source, source


That splash against my hollow bones
That rocks my soul


Outside the check cashing, flashing, dipped in fashion
Five cherry-faced faggots tried to cash in
They keep laughing  Ghost, you'll get your face bashed in
Who gave you these privileges son? Why you maxing?
And we... fiending to take those
Move slow, I'm hearing how you broke Rob's nose
And I heard you keep a banging hammer, golden brass
Diamonds embroideries that was stolen that you haven't reported, G
Make very little noise, my shit hiccup
Don't make this big stick up big up me and the boys
I thought for a second then chose rather than froze
Had the Gem Star in my hand... yo, what the fuck?
Yo, that's when I ripped Timothy, snatched and dipped
Jumped right in back of him, had the mini axe tool, faxed him
Shots rang off, bing-boggle-de-dum





The sword it's the best weapon of all
Two sharp edges, and a long spine
The blade is very thin and it's easily damaged
You remember that: the vital thing is the point
Pay special attention to it, your life could depend on it




The library of slangs - dutches up in Ukraine
Political prisoner, check the chain
Out the country with my dame
Televised gangsters, see me up close, nothing's changed
Gettin' top on top, bags and duffels
I need the long Glock
You stupid? Don't play me
See 'em in drugs spots, plainclothes, all in shock...
Gal can't even explain me
I live for the moment, give to the homeless
$20,000 TEKs, cribs is a bonus
You fuckin' with them niggas who bust straight
Menace to society drinkin' juice in the hood, waitin'
Paper made me do it, your body we'll snatch
It's like a London flick against the Japs
Sittin' at the dice table, handlin', man to man
One-on-one, a hundred grand and your son


In life we're faced with obstacles
We want to achieve dreams that might seem impossible
The odds don't lie, look at mine - acknowledge truth
The streets raised me to be wise and honorable...
Wise and honorable...
The streets raise me to be wise and honorable...
Wise and honorable....
The streets raised me to be wise and honorable


Beef and money don't mix, invest in peace
I've paid dues in the street, respect is my receipt
Truth will set you free, except with police
Be aware when you sleep or you could rest in peace
I elevate poetically, I'm incredibly deep
Never ball 'til you fall, capisce? Stay on your feet
If you were anxiously waitin' for me and Rae on the beat
Be gracious, understand patience is key
I once needed direction now I'm facin' the East
To give praise like Mohammed
Indeed Allah opened my eyes, I'm watchin' my surroundings
Sharks and piranhas survive in the warmest waters
Mama Sana won't allow me to acknowledge doubters
Couldn't conceive I was built to prosper
The team wearin' diamond jewelry in the projects
If you get knocked, housing's gonna seize your apartment








I like this shit I'm seein' in the front too
(yo yo yo yo true)
That's important, know what I mean?
(It's 'bout the time man, it's 'bout the time yo)
That Afro-American black shit, you know?


We're the mighty Force MD's, we came to get pai-aid
This is a Hot Request that must be played
We're gonna bring it back, to where it all began
Straight from the Jungle Nillz of Shaolin


What is it? Yeah..
It's all money on it
Puttin' CREAM on it

Aiyo Staten Island gun bust, gold and plaque statue on the bus

You can hold my hand, when they sing baby
Pedestrians ride, fake niggas move aside
I'm the Don of the game, together we the two 4-5s


Projects in front of 3:31
We sing in front of our family and friends for fun (light)
Peak our ashtray to the very full (what is it? what is it?)
Nigga I'm just livin' without bein' broke
Mr. Magic on the radio, got us a deal when he heard us blow

Heard us blow, heard us blow, heard us blow

Fantastic, fantastic..
For the people, get that human bein' vibe
Around people, of hip-hop (live, live)

{*beat comes back in*}
Makin' heats, out showin' on the road
We toured around the world and lots of records we sold
Made money like we've never seen before (it's all real in the field)
Houses, clothes and Reebok, valued so much more (what? what?)
Now our fame is really sweet, everybody was playin' us on the street
On the street, on the street, on the street.. (yeah)
All we achieved, all we achieved..
Still there were life's treasures deep (make it here, for real)
Treasures deep.. we never could reach
Force was too fresh to keep.. it's all love


Straight up fella show 'em how we bid
Rather receive that give, throw jewels in a nigga wig, live
Goin' back, mockneck hats, cordoroys
Bill Blass belts, gazelles, armory days
Slacks, brush 'em sideways, you liver
Fly ass straddler, recognize Dick
The watch blind ya eyes up
Staten Island click rep on
Violate, get stepped on
These shots'll blow through your teflon
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, what? What?


People say we're old school, and we say "yeah that's true"
If it wasn't for cats like us and Cold Krush
There wouldn't be no lethal (yeah yeah you know the deal)
No ya know the story, we made it to the to-op
We're gonna keep it movin' from the two to the low
And we ain't gonna sto-op


Yo peace out to ??, Dr. Rock rest in peace
Force MD's, we out




Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump
Troops on the left, fight to the death
Fam on the right, infrared lights
Wolves in the back, ready to attack, for what
Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump


I pop off like a mobster boss
Angel hair with the lobster sauce
Summertime can't top the scorch
Check my hot broad, I dropped the Porsche
FBI wanna watch the force, trying to lock my source
Where I'm from, hear the macs, techs, Glocks and fours
Hide the safe, nigga, lock the doors
No respect for the cops and laws
In the land where your own blood brother still plot for yours
Seen things that'll drop your jaw
My soldiers got dropped in war, see the mural on the project wall?
Won't stop til I copped them all
Wanna block me? You gots to brawl, trade shots and all
Cuz I ain't on the clock for talk
The Spot Rusher, blow down the spot for sure
Still break off the block with raw, my stock is more
The General, watch your board


Deep pockets with the eight on me, sleep with the safe in the wall
The camo's on with the make-up and all
Swap six 45's, twist reefer in the flicks, papi whoadie ride
Bolt his gun off, from know your horse, she lied
Fly criteria, bury me in Africa
With whips and spears, and rough diamonds out of Syria
A true don, only I could do wrong
Rock fitted hats, get crack money and drive a sick blue joint
Retard-less, I'mma blow regardless
Resume is straight up live, I shank niggas up for larger E's
And speak with the youth in the spot, eat the fresh fruit in the crop
All these hip hoppers eat cock
You could see me in the street or the yacht
I'd rather be promoting your block or buying fresh sneakers with gwops
Yo, I'm an ill dude, always been a real dude
Don't fuck around, I will spill on you and kill you in the field, boo


Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump
Troops on the left, fight to the death
Fam on the right, infrared lights
Wolves in the back, ready to attack, for what
Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump


Leather jackets on, rocked up rock stars
Treacherous bank robbers, the plan go dub, we pop guards
The team gotta eat, seeds is hungry, that's why we ain't scared
To dump on niggas, our guns is chunky
Usually we bust niggas down with bats, swell up they joints
Elbow, wrists, they shins get cracked
We still humiliate, brutalize, Ruger pop, pulverize
Still got gear in the closet, that's stupid live
From Benetton rugby skullies, Oshkosh conductor jumpers
The train hats fit me lovely
Rae job is to make sure the coke is fluffy
While I politic his birthday bash with Puffy
Bagged Nia soon as I linked up, the kid ain't inked up
I'm an old mummy, my gold weigh as much as King Tut (yeah, yeah)
Slippers, robes is minked up, under the doorag, bro (uh, yo, yo)
My three dimensional fade is clean cut


Man, ya'll niggas ain't shit to us, still a pistol bust
Split your melon like I split the Dutch
Got a lot of piff to puff, and I ain't come for fisticuffs
Or for the cop that wanna clip the cuffs
Man, is Staten in this bitch or what?
Don't get it twisted, we, twist it up and even mixed with dust
See these fans can't resist the rush, they Wu-Tang for life
Scarred for life, they can't forget the cuts
Got a whole line of classic joints, and while you at it
Pass the joint, let's push this music past the point
Of no return, til it crash and burn, down the ashes
Then placed inside Ol' Dirty Bastard's urn
When it's my time to go, for sure, ya nigga goes to war
What you think I brought these soldiers for?
To send shot, like forget me not, at any nigga
Respect, bitch, that figure they gon' get me got


Heheh, your basic kung fu's no good
You can't move fast enough!
And you don't have enough strength!
And your body movements are like a street fighter!
It's too easy for me to trip you up!
(Fighting sounds)
Heheh, how's it feel, eh?
Ah, it's no good I feel my back's broken!
Heheh, you've still got a lot to learn!

I went from Jackie to Janice, Trina to Tameka
She had the fattest ass if my niggas woulda seen her
See a nigga on, before you know it I'm gone
Front of the coliseum watchin girls eyes roam
Just a throwback nigga, with the Motorola phone
Hopped in the spaceship, whole 'nother zone
We outta here; back to the Bronx where the real stay
Every last Sunday of the month call it Krillz day
Every other week I hear somebody tryin to kill me
But I be out of town, gettin money where the bills lay
Ice cream, ice cream, she wants ice cream
Says she's on a diet so I hit her with the light cream
I got the sweetest love, you know that rock thick
Shorty you can lick lick, suck on this big dick (AOW~!)
Hold up, shit, you better get your wet wipes
You know Joey G'd up, I got every stripe
I got houses on the side of mountains
I'm more fearless than every one of my killers
If your girl leaves with me, she gon' keep comin
She gon' keep cummin, keep cummin, she gon' love me (ow)


Ice cream, ice cream, who wants ice cream?
Hey - everybody screamin for that ice cream
When she screams, I scream, I scream, she screams
Hey - everybody screamin for that ice cream
Ice cream, I'm the ice cream man
Yes the ice cream, I'm the cream man {*3X*}

Two time Johnny, two freaks when I slay 'em
Always get new ones, old ones might play 'em
Bumpin "Maybach Music" and I'm in the Maybach
Come and get your ice cream, lil' mama lay back

Cause we be trizzin, hit you from the front and the back
My time is money, better have my money ASAP
I done came up, I can bet them niggas hate that
If your girl leave with me, she gon' keep comin
Comin keep cummin, keep cummin, she gon' love me




Yo, aiyyo
Who smelled the fragrance? It was Chanel mixed with YSL
Flagged in burgun', serpent know well
We at a large brunch, discussin the God's punch
Kayla with Bartles & Jaymes, shorty kept starin at my shell son
And my velour was rugged, my whip was 400
Gangsters I was with flashed all hundreds
Gucci couture to store shit
Let me get the number love the worker exhausted, I forced it
(That's right) Paragon style, I'm fly with it, might be what'chu want
With good taste, put you in a good space
Sat back, check her shape, good shape
Plus she vegan, I'm fiendin for you like Swiss cake
My medicine is you and me in love, the plug was a match
Gats on the center, Irish pub
She kept laughin, lickin her lips, listen to flicks
Clean Aston, now I got my hand on her tits, but uhh




Yeah! Hustle super fly shit, y'knahmean?
On that A.C.G. shit, that fly Pelle
Jumpin out that brand new whip on my own tip
Little Dominican mami you feel me?

Get at me nigga






Ma, Ma, throw down some money
The ice cream man is coming


Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
And scooped in my ice cream truck, who tears it up


Yo honey dip, summertime fine, jewelry dripping
Seen you on Pitkins with a bunch of chickens how you're clicking
I kept shooting strong notes as we got close
She rocked rope, honey throat smelling like Impulse
Your whole shell baby's wicked like Nimrod
Caught me like a fresh-water scrod, or may I not be God
Attitude is very rude boo, crabby like seafood
It turns me on like Vine's Cee Allah Rule
They call me Starky Love hon, check the strategy
By any means, Shirley Temple curls was done by Billie Jeans
Black Mrs. America, your name is Erica, right true
Lazy eyeball, small feet, six shoe
Caramel complexion, breath smelling like cinnamon
Excuse me hon, the Don mean no harm, turn around again

I'm rocking hats and your wig is all intact
Who's that queen bee chick, eyes pearly black

Two-finger rings and gold teeth and ain't afraid to hold heat
So when I step in the square dear

Ooh baby I miss you, your sweet tender touches
Take pulls off the Dutches
Orgasm in my mind state, masturbate in your clutches

Chicks are at each other for the sting, who want the most of me
Only a hard dozen wanna be calling me cousin
Thirsty for my catalog, baby shopping spree you're loving

Aiyo, butter pecan Ricans, love a little candy girl
Caramel cover girl, love the way your body twirl
French vanilla cream, body work is mean
Chocolate fudge make a nigga wanna fall in love


Got them fat legs, killin' them Gucci's
Heels on, with the fat coochie
The way it's feelin' you seducin' me
Take time, create, yeah my legend is straight now
Ya inner vibe's the side of the juicy
Cheeba queen, treats on, jeans, state to state
And she got the nerve to fuck me all mean
While I rock all green, by all means
We in the mall fiendin', one more hump then I'mma scream
Boo throw me more of you, I'll take all four of you
We could flip it on the floor while I'm pourin' on you
Make me kiss it in the store on you
Cop the new drawers, the dick is all yours it's a mornin' blue
Straight mines, thats a warnin' duke
Watch me climb, that pussy looks shaped and designed
Yeah, line for line, rhyme for rhyme
That coochie is mine, I might just need it this time




Shut the fuck up and get in the car
Girl, your high beams is on, I wonder how they fit in that bra
We in the front seat, splittin' cigars
I'm on my job so you handcuffin' ho ass niggas, be on your guard
Especially on ladies night, I like it when they take a swallow
Straight out the bottle, but that ain't lady-like
I call 'em lil' pet names like Ma and Boo-Boo
So everytime I see your girlfriend, never confuse you
With the next down-ass chick, that play a part
That's cool enough to pardon my French menage a trois
Meth Man, real talk, don't mean to put you on the spot
But I know a spot to kick your heels off
I'm not as Dirty as that Bastard, be
But still a villain, I serve 'em Dick Dastardly
Here's a little taste of Ice Cream II (Ice Cream II)
So put some Vicky Secret on, trick, I might swing through




Yo, I love my dick-size, like I love women and shit
My head grew over these years, now I got a nice dick
Beauty mark right on my balls, girl, have a nice lick
Cute in the face, hair-do, you got some nice lips
Pussy monkeys holdin' my cock, just like it's vice grips
Part down the crack of your ass, your frame is priceless
Butter-butter caramel swirl, chocolate chip
French vanilla sundae girls, banana split
Cum drip down in your chin, right on your soft tits
Put your hand gently in mine, give me a soft kiss
What's really good? Girl, slip me your number
You blowin' up, and your lookin' Ice Cream this summer
Better than Beyonce, Halle Berry and them
Honey, you lookin' scrumptous, I ain't worried 'bout them
You my straight hood chick, girl, you more than a gym
You got that fat tight pussy like Notorious KIM
Butter-butter caramel swirl, chocolate chip
French vanilla sundae girls, banana split, uh..






Tommy Hill rocking ice niggas
Tommy Hill ice rocking niggas who fuck...
Mira, afrente
Take a one on one to this shit y'all
Get your nostrils clear
Come on, sniff your brains out
All my Al Capone, Al Pacino niggas
Who's down with drug smuggling
Cappadonna, Golden Arms


Check out the rap kingpin, the black Jesus
I know a few niggas sniff coke and caught seizures
Peace to half-moon Caesars, and all the bitches in the bleachers
Hot weather, sex on the beaches
Jewelry shopping out of the country, deluxe luxury
People saying that my chains look truck on me
But what about the Wonder Woman bracelet
Two-oh point three diamond cut engraved rubies kid, I laced it
My sweet tooth gotta nigga throbbing, ready for robbing
But first hit Maria's for a butter almond
The bionic microphone is Smack Mechanic
Move like a bunch of Mexicans with bandanas
Son it's on, so we can just max a million
I got the spot sewn so we can make a billion
The God's tropical, ladies call me black fruit punch
Rainbow flavor niggas murder niggas for lunch
Peace to the Paris Crew in the avenue, and my nigga Jay Love
Who carry switchblades on the reg, duke


Yo, the first branch, the third leaf, whoever want it got beef
I politic, show love, crush those who dare creep
Into my realm of sunshine I praise divine
Fine line between Donna dumb, deaf and blind
He ain't mine, he shook like the faggots in daytime
Crossed over grain while we was bubbling moonshine
Sipping on a Moet, laid up, Rae-Gambino
Mastermind the plan, Tony Starks, Cappachino
Developed while your head be swelling up off of the Nation
Blinded by the ice while I release the confrontation
Donna holy fat bags of weed, ravioli
Pasta, bodyguard the killa bee songs like Kevin Costner
Infra-red all inside your bumbo, rasta
Cappadonna pimp the derby like the mobster


Yeah, yeah
Eight spaghetti lame brain ass niggas
Quarters, nickels, and dimes bitch
Except for overtime nigga
Any ass money suit me fine
Cause I'm coming strong, breaking niggas backs
Keeping shit real
If you haven't noticed bitchy ass rusty, ass nigga
Let me tell you this one time
Tony Starks, Raekwon the chef
Cappachino and Golden Arms
Is coming through mad strong
From the isles of Shaolin
For all them faggot ass
Rusty chickenhead bitches too
Shup Shup baby?


Yo back in the days, bagging cracks, scraping plates, flipping cakes
Who them heavy head niggas hating Jakes
It be us, wall to wall soldiers, hanging in halls getting over
City niggas shoot for blood money rocking Rovers
Stay dipped, don't have no money in your pocket in the streets
Why these people mob money in they Jeep
Crack bums watch your back for jums
Cost me for a fake twenty dollar bill
Get 'em son, we ain't the one
Politicking, plus vicking, sick of these Dominicans
Eating good, had to shoot my way up out of Bennigans
That's life, to top it all off, beef with White
Pulling bleach out trying to throw it in my eyesight
Yo what the fuck is on your mind?




I declare war, own you sucker
Niggas fuck you all
Go get your ones up
Hey, go get your guns up


Building destroyed is the mind-state
Cant at the clock, make the time Straight to 3:15
Then 12:30, whoever is hell worthy
Got the 9 clip, that I called sweet 16
One in the dome, in the zone like a twilight
Shoot good, slam hard, sports and the highlights
The G talking, you should know what he saying
You was making the movie, I'm the cinema playing in
Take a seat cause it's showtime
Now is your time, when youd nigga that's swinging it
Wolves and gorillas and them villains in them high rise
Blue nines and Maroon 5, we the fly guys
Now everything the same over here king
Just more money, less friends, let's see what this year bring
Let's know what your n*ggas, they start tripping
Take the Bravo, long black clipping
Pull up on your block, straight ass whipping
I'm not sad soul shoot, I don't wanna meet you
I get money in three tours, I'm so boss coast through
Psychopathic thoughts, I put it in ink
I'm a genius, Harvard wanna know what I think
They call me Don Don, silverback, gorilla my soul
They say I'm hot now, guess it take a while to bloom
D-Block when we come through, give us some room nigga




A few killers, huh, a few getters
Big Furs in Pittsburgh, we're true stealers
Just serve a six birds to few dealers
Realer, who ella spread like Nutella
Martella, Marchello, sleeves grey
Saw a fish and next door neighbor
And three A for three K, I have a spark for three days
While I'm parked watching power play by D-Ray
Dont even ask about no boy, home with the money team
And I don't know Floyd, get your hate out
Next class the Rolls-Royce, No voice
Let the tray out, faster than dow boy




Sent from heaven, God gave us
Mac 11s and 7s, Ferragamo footwear
Lion Heart's legends, Flicfair Kahuna's
Come through, get wild and pumas
Burning piles of dow, up inside the room is red
The paper is long, the ninja is stronger
Knock the wind out of you like bombs of enigma
Depending when niggas get drunk, fuck the tremendous
I'm in the stairs with shares, nigga it's business
The pipeline is horrible, connects the mauders
The gun filled with bombs, the shells niggas is formers
All the money fly, dressed to Kill My will
Keep you wanting milk from Dreas and Kai
Living off the land, living just like the lottery niggas
Only difference we pump heroin off the bitches
Feeding teams, playing, sit back gleaming
What you wanna eat
Now he hanging from my choppa, hold his feet






Ayo, he pulled out his gun and started schemin'
Stood right there, blue trees in his space like police bleamin'
80, nothin' like these new born babies
Fresh off the recliner, guns squeeze, pay me
Hit an L, dynamic, move like I'm Wit and Dale
All of this is made like waves, I make sicker sail
There's niggas that rhyme and niggas that grind
That's my man, we only in the Benz that don't shine
Comparing me to money, suitted up Fila jumper
With the New Balance on I'm fine
The specialist, curly haired kids perpetuous
Slide in your bitch, give her dick that's treacherous
Catch me on leany, egged out, GreyGoosein' in the coupe
Callin' up Duke, come see me
Wise words givin', saw him in a flyin' spur
Givin' sign in the earth, lets work, nigga

I used to wonder how people became stars and then return to their roots
Till I had to switch up the Cons, take a turn of the roots
Cause the fact they had Kwon out their CD changer
It must've been enough to turn my friends into strangers
Cause now they keepin' secrets when I'm in danger
And mirrors wise crack like god in the manger
But why should I name ya? I can speak to your conscience
You would feel the position that you see your boy Cons in
Cause now I'm on fire like the start of an arson
And even TV gettin' dinner like (?)
So the way I disappear right before Autumn hits
Or be like a magician like picked from the audience
And there goes the auto tricks to catch up to Rae
To somethin' smells fishy like the catch of the day
Make me grab a gun from my personal safety
But I'm the kind of person that won't keep it on safety, but...

Really not much, I finna do rhythm
Get the fuck away from me 'fore I spit 'em
Purple drinkin' swag, but (?) in 'em
Nigga talkin' now like what now wit 'em?
First off, 9 outta 10 he snitchin'
Skurts when that thing starts spittin'
Now you tryna have feds at my door
Doin' dirty, cake way clean, cause I'm a boss
Colgate smile while your cocaine's foul
Somewhere chillin', burnin' hella dro down
(?) few and carried by 6
Just by 12 takin' court room flicks
After Biggie and Pac I was like word?
Niggas killin' rappers, I ain't tryna go dirt
Without even thinkin', leave a nigga on the curb

Straight max, burgundy Lex, swing a few bats
I'm Gretzky, hockey mask on in the 'jects, yo
I'm eating like Hortons, Gorton's fisherman hat
A wristband flooded, Jew-jeweler selection
It's obvious I blow shit up
Keep gun smoking, yo, jump in a boat doin'  a buck
Hundred sons bagging XK Jags
Brawler face, meatloaf your man up in the back of the wagon
Drugs equal money, money equals sunny days
Timbs, cut off shorts and gorgeous with a ton of haze
Bank book crook, yo, I'm looking
Brooklyn style, go 'head and juggle here, goonie's gon' book you
It's like a tunnel when it's hard to get in
You the target, the hardest niggas know when to win
We in the corners, all eaters, bottles of Seagrams
OG shit, now my niggas will peace you, what


I got the money that the banks can't hold
I got money, na na na na na

This ain't a bitch ass boom-bap
It's click-clack, move back
On 40th and Lennox where them killers and goons at
The Boogie Down Bronx is where my family moved at
I made it out the slums and I'll be damned if we move back
Where killers knew rap, and niggas get jewels snatched
My niggas on the runway with bandanas and doo-rags
Jiggy since the perm, Raf Simmons with 2 straps
I kick it with my niggas in the building and move packs
The money I be making kinda sacred, don't say it
Just make sure you save it, thank God that you made it
Taxes, pay it -  the bullshit, save it
The blueprint, I laid it - the radio, they play it
So relay it, replay it then rate it but truth debate it
Relate it, best way to  it, but you too afraid to say it
They hatin', they claim we affiliate with Satan
But it's cool like ice, keep it skatin', amen


I got the money that the banks can't hold
I got money, na na na na na
I got money, na na na na na
I got money, na na na na na

The pursuit of perfection nigga
Chef, A$AP. Shout out the Mob nigga, ha ha
Yeah, Ice H20
The golden city, yeah nigga, ha ha
Yeah, do that shit, do that shit
Do that shit, do that shit, do it

Real niggas bust ya pistols in the sky
I'm a muthafuckin' G and til I die
I get that paper, and I'm chillin' on the low
All I need, is more money more


Cuz, I gotta get paid, I gotta stay paid
I gotta get paid, I gotta get this money
I gotta get paid, I gotta stay paid
I gotta get paid, I gotta get this money, man


I get that paper for shizzle, I'm breakin' bread with my niggas
I ride around with them triggas, I clap back nigga
I shoot that uzi like hoops, I ride around in them Coupe's
Got alligator on boots, my pockets fat nigga
We overseas with the Wu, we blowin' trees with our crew
All my clothes brand new, you gotta love it man
I'm on top of my game, rocks on top of my chain
Catchin' planes to Spain, nigga, you know I'm thuggin', man
We pushin' whips you can't buy, 24 hours we high
I believe I can fly, I'm fucked up, dog
I smoke that shit you can't get, we spit that shit you can't spit
Fifteen tracks, no skits, so fuck all y'all




Shorties bouncin', forty ounces, Lex gon' kill up all the bouncers
Round my shit, gon' fall up out you
Raw that nigga, bring horror up out you
Thought about you, blow that forty and call the cops too
I'ma be out by four and route you
Pussy ass nigga, bring horror up out you, valor the couch, too
I'm amazin', when they pass the gauge in
Sky blue Phantom with beige in
Stop changin' it, ride it for a month
Then come up, make my change in it
Not done, the best, to get it, Uncle, let's get it
What's really real if Lex can't get it?
Shaolin whip big techs again
Fuck around and caught me a Mexican bitch




I blow your face off, cake off, then buy an acre, stayed off
My mustache like Adolf, don't let me pull my cape off
It's Superman lover, fuck it, no other
We just a group of bad brothers, y'all pussy, now check it
Rap DeNiro, crazy Shapiro, pushin' through customs
Back from Europe, and we changin' our Euro's for money
The Wallabees gummy, with so much paper I'm dead
Call me a cheese dummy, and we dip our leaves in honey
Awwwww, you wanna see the hammer?
Awwwww, you wanna hit the canvas?
I will not waste my time on frontin' ass
Niggas, that do not excease








I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rocking the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I be gettin' the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son
Rolling with this one and that one
(Bongo by the way)


(Red Wallabies) Buzzin' with my Killa Beez
Chronic had my eyes chinky like Compton was the Philippines
Junior prom, red suit, Tasha in that limousine
Tryna suck the head off my dick like a guillotine
Came in her mouth, then gave her some Listerine
Put a condom on and let her grind it like a centipede
(Cash rules everything around me)
Before Dre found me, before my city crowned me
Bummy lil nigga, pussy niggas used to clown me
Had to wear my brother's clothes, them shits used to drown me
6 years passed, now I'm banging in the county
Niggas that used to talk shit, won't even come around me
Reciting Method Man while my celly just sit there
Niggas know I been on the Wu before Ric Flair
Came home through the hood, GX shinin'
Now these bitches think I'm Lex Diamonds


Nigga I grew up on Wu-Tang
Nigga I grew up on Wu-Tang
(Cash rules everything around me)
(Cash rules everything around me)


I grew up on Wu-Tang, dope had my shoe game Liu Kang
Jordan 12's sick as hell, Michael Jordan flu game
Glass jar, Pyrex, obsessed with the blue flame
Lexus coupe, rubbin' on them titties boy, 2 Chainz
Top of the food chain, niggas wanna kill me
'Cause I turned into the plug, I'm where the chronic and the pills be
RZA with the rings, Ol' Dirty with the stainless
Five .38 revolvers, thirty-six chambers
Killah like Ghostface, as the Rollie rotate
Daytons on the S-Class equipped with the floor safe
And we had the stash spots with them red and blue tops
Chronic in the GLAAD lock, the dope spot padlocked
In the living room baggin' shit up, watchin' Matlock
Black Glock, crack rock bundled in my black socks
And my mama workin' late, skinny nigga servin' weight
Let the chronic circulate the Purple Tape


I grew up on Wu-Tang
Nigga I grew up on Wu-Tang
(Cash rules everything around me)
(Cash rules everything around me)
(C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dollar, dollar bill y'all)




Hey yo, lemme get a turkey burger. Swiss cheese on it

He got popped at Johnny ,plate hit the floor, he played dead, she walked out
Fuck the nigga Rae

Yo call the ambulance nigga, your wife shot you yo pa this is ugly
Pointed to the charm on his neck, took it off, "Give it to Brenda"
His old aunt, she transgender

Get away, he got a boulder, sipping Coca-Cola
Officer Brown, a faggot
He killed my kin Big Case in October
Nigga started lookin, fuck you I'm booking
And bounced, threw my shick on the ground, I'm coming Brooklyn
Never been a shook one, if anything  I book niggas
Full time hustler, yup crook niggas
Yeah we seen what happened, young nigga thirty years old
His father was into cooking



Flash, we meet
Passin' in the streets
Words unspoken
Silence unbroken, hey

Just by chance
We fell into romance
The cry of success
Left no room to guess

Oh, no (Oh, no)
Love has knocked us down and scored
We've been twice around the block before
Know the changes you've been through
My promise is to you

I'll be good
Ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Better than before
You know I'll love you more

I'll be good
Ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Better than before
You know I'll love you more

I fell in love so quick
I knew that this was it
So much emotion
Made so much devotion

And when we talk
We're never miles apart
Your telephone line
Is tied right to my heart

(Love me, baby)
Your love has knocked me down and scored
(Knock me out, baby)
You may hide and close your door
(Baby, baby)
Open up, I swear it's true
(What you gonna do)

I'll be good {I just wanna be good}
To you (How good)
Better than before (Mmm...)
You know I'll love you more

I'll be good
Will you be good, boy
{So good}, so good {Hey}
Better than before
You know I'll love you more

When we talk
We're never miles apart
Telephone line (Telephone line)
Tied straight to my heart

I fell in love so quick
I thought my mind was playin' tricks
One twist of fate
Made it somethin' so great

Let me show you how to live
Stop goin' from town to town
Don't be afraid to give
Time to settle down

When I'm good I'm bad
And when I'm bad I'm better
When I'm at my best
There's no room to guess

I'll be good
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Better than before
You know I'll love you more

I'll be good
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Mmm... ooh

I'll be good
Better than before
Know I'll love you more
Better than before
You know I'll love you more

I'll be good, good, good, good
I'll be good, good, good, good
I'll be good, good, good, good
I'll be good, good, good, good
I'll be good, good, good, good
I'll be good, good, good, good




When I write my lyrics, it's like, it's like
I want my shit to be phat, I want people to be able to understand
Yo, Anybody can rhyme, youknowhatimsaying
But it's what you saying that makes a person know about you
Knowhatimsaying, you know the type of person you is
So it's like really, I'm just more of just
Being a street narrator (aiyo, what up, famo?)


Reefer lit, love hip hop, the gangstas got me like the broccoli
Brooklyn baby cooling at a swat meet
Real niggas wanna meet me, ladies wanna eat me
Money clean Mercedes claim, baby, beat me
Love getting dressed up, sweats and techs
Ride around the hood, good, getting Gotti respect
Hand is golden, an OG rolling and holding, yo
Fresh kicks, soft leather, pockets is swollen
Let my jam hit your tape deck, it's straight up, and made up
For every real nigga with his gun on him, hate up
Flying through the city nights, new flights
Blue ice, hundred thousand in a Nike bag, license
Drug shop, I'm sorry, Atari in the Ferrari
Next see the Lex A Shallah, La Tam'pa
Eating yo, all of us, scamma gangstas
You know we honor, tip the kangol, cooling in the brown vengos


I have never, giving up on a mission
That's against my honor


Duke let me warn you, my niggas crip up
Them young boys'll run up on you, shoot your whip up
Brooklyn, nigga, beg for you life
And my Staten Island homeys lay your ass down on Glaciers of Ice
Sidewalk executives, live the street life consecutive
We built for this, go for your gun
My prospective is, another day in the life, of money and drugs
Big hammers and slugs, can get ugly as fuck


From the chest to your man Danze, ey
Staten Island, said what up, yo, ey
The homey ODB said what up, though, ey
We got the Chef on deck as if you didn't know
It's sharp as fuck, Wu, that's what up
Pack it up, wanna rap, wanna rock, what up?
Wanna pop, get up, fuck around and get your block hit up
Bring your team and we'll box 'em up
Think M.O.P. is not what up


It seems I'm a bit late here
Don't worry, these men are all gonna die


See from the side where it slum at, dum at, rum at
Cognac, combat, contact, contrast
Crom's packing out like Beyonce back
She bang out a song like the Fonz back
Bigger things, bring the slangs, slicker than the sharpest pen
Nigga here, combat, sweet dick Willie T, Rudy Ray Moore game
Woodgrain all in the board reigns, before rain flooded
Like storm drains, boss man, bundling raw 'caine
Fours bang, neighborhood war games
Get your weight up, you looking anarexic
Posted on the block proper with the hammer vested
Bitch came with empty hands, that's the hand she left with
Thirsty ass with the water and it sounded desperate
Break a white an hour, based it forty grand invested
Live within the third rail, you know the man electric
Shit was like the third world, until I handle metrics, that next shit




Ricky Ross, Raekwon the Chef
Thrill 5 M-I-A, yo
Ya'll know what time it is (trilla) boss


When I'm in the crib (crib), know what time it is (is)
I'm trying to get a mill (mill), so money I can feel (feel)
Fuck a bank account (boss) keep my money in bags (bags)
If you coming here funny, I'm gunning your ass
Nigga, take a look at me, Ross, tell me what's fucking funny (funny)
Bitch, I'm a top shotter (shotter), see all the macks, gunny
Now I'm the pacman, I keep the packs coming
And I got a whole lot, so when that shack coming, baby
I can hold mine, or I can pitch back
Or I can run an option, get it popping, whip that
All my Cuban links, still rocking they Cuban Linx
And they ready to swim, give me the cuban six
I got it orchestrated, cuz I'm a communist
Running for the charms, some left on the wrist
My nigga Raekwon, yeah, he the fucking Chef
So what we cook in the kitchen, he taste the fucking best


Nigga, I'm a boss, you can catch me with the top knocked off
In the trap, getting blocks knocked off
Cuz, nigga, I'm a boss, and I'mma show these niggas I ain't gotta talk
I got a chaffeur, nigga, I ain't got to walk
Cuz, nigga, I'm a boss, cross the line, pay the fine top cost
Lose your mind when the nine pop off
Cuz, nigga, I'm a boss, I'm a boss, I'm a boss
Cuz, nigga, I'm a boss, I'm a boss, I'm a boss


You know we rich, Rick, my vultures, they get dip, we posting
It's in motion, when that blow come, we flip-flip
Can't take us nowhere, pa, too many spaceships
Lay in the open, new Nike's with glaciers
Love robbing niggas, cracking heads open
It's like tennis, pa, I'm like Venus with the legs smoking
Piping hot heroes, gun deleros, new Aston
Sky blue jammy, skating on zeros
Shorts on, tree lance, cable on, hang to my navel
Diamond down, smoking cheeba, Grey Goose
Dreaming bout lasagna, the beat watery
Half glass of Whiskey, fly light skin little shorty
All my bitches they bang, it's obvious, we be the Gods
Rep me and my mobster sang
We monsters, rocket launchers, razor blades
With wands on, shoot up the telly, go bonkers



 (P.C.) {Polite}
Yo, I'm the money collector (for that money I'll stretch ya)
{I flat line you with that gun that's up under my dresser}
I be handling pies (god damn it I'm fly
It's so high, that if I jump I'll land in the sky)
{You ain't pushing no weight} You a pussy you fake
I be cooking that base (Butter just look at they face)
{Lite keep 'em coming back} The Don, keep 'em coming back
(It's the boss and Rick Ross on the fucking track)

Yo I'm get a pass on you, hit me up


Yo, my technique wires nigga's jaws
Take your's, we caked up playin boards
The sword spinnin, rotary dice, white linen
Invite women, chunks of ice on spinnin
Money on the back hand, rackin pinion
Stacked out, black civilian, chrome teeth, billions
Uh, Kennedy money, twist the Don King
Raise your arm, who rock a stockin cap? Calm, gritty songs
Broadcast the line on you spark steakhouse
Medowlark, he threw the eight out
Threw his darts, don't play without
Falcon in Atlanta with a bandana
White bitches fly, he threw a Santana blow thru Rose's Hanna
Big Duke rockin right there, eye observin his grill
Power silencers is real, eh yo
Ak feed the block, drop teaspoons, feed em for slot
Versace rag top bop, playin cops
Air Max, Newdoff threw his suit off
Pepsi paper, we can't paint em with the Lakers, Lakers
Throw a retainer down, Cream Team deligators throw the flame out
Polly popper with a large wop, eh yo, check it out...


Yo, we makin power moves, sprayin power navigators
Cash Rules, coast to coast, city to city
See poppi flash, eight niggas, eight Jeeps and a stash fool
And when the drama pop up, then they harass you
Run up on ya ass with all black ski masks, fool
Cuz you naw on niggas ass like a cashew
Iced down, platinum G-twelve when we blast thru
Holigen lights, monitors in the dash, fool
Politicin about this paper we gon keep gettin
Mo rollies, more Jeeps, sittin, deep dishin
Wishin, oh, one day, you're gon be sittin
With Ak Father, makin moves out to San Quinten


When we speak, niggas listen like Evangelist

With the Vibe Crack Entertainment back in this
(Cory Ak and Raekwon, yo, imagine this)

(Cory Ak and Raekwon, yo, imagine this)


Yo, framin well on, dunn be jailin on songs
He run with five live killer whale cons
Marketin, Jibar clothes on barkin
Take it back, six-seven waves, shark skin
Three-twenty wagons, flaggin down dragons
Grab him, he got his paper in his pocket, let's have him
Benz seagal, Ezekial chapters, sneak previews
At you, catch the moment like a statue
Analyzin the figures, niggas pull bigger
Tradin in vigors, mascarade, paid niggas
Buenos dias, C.I, collect chicked casa Filas
Yo, we own boats, rackin down 40 kilas


Yo, not tryin to blow, you fuckin with a bartender
Bird with navigation, y'all niggas get lost, players
The utmost, pretty young thugs that pack toast
And ain't afraid to cash the Filas and get close
Somebody goin coast to coast like Van Andrews
Throw that shit on the vegetables
We got more bitches to cut thru
Who you? I can't see you, y'all can't see me
Cuz y'all niggas put on shows like WB's
While my network ain't nuttin but Terantino flicks
You know? Guns, money, bitches and hot whips
Hot shit, nothin 'less spitten by Ben Franklin
And your girl bathe me with her rongue


Y'all niggas can't ready for Teddy to hop out of the Chevy
Two guns, four clips, chips in the Benzy
Forty-inch, Cuban heavy, I been down
Can't come up, shine from sundown to sun-up
Some clown'll run up, yappin his mouth
'Til Teddy pull out his six and smack in his mouth
Fuck your car, catch Teddy, jackin your house
Takin all your shit, plus kidnappin your spouse
While your ass still sleepin in bed
Havin wet dreams about how you plan on stoppin Ted
Little light-skin nigga, about a buck sixty-seven
High five-ten but I pack a mac-eleven

Chorus


Yea, yea, y'all know it's real in the field

I need three days to fuck Paris, to gun and to do much carrots
Pablo strength, I blow up a Dutch palace
And flex on these Jays with waves on
My swades is amazing, I'm holdin' them K's up in Barclays
Test this face like Bronson
Burner in your mouth, get kicked in ya Johnson, meet Jaeson

Big 4.5 on me , yeah

Weird lightning bolts fly out the candle y'all
Meet me at the spot all messiahs

Tuckered out the OT, then I came here to cut you out
Found a couple pieces, told them to figure the puzzle out
It was all a dream, then I put the duffle out
Gave 'em a ball of green, that's what I call a brussel out
What the fuck you 'bout? Nothing I'm the toughest mother fucka
Comin' up this route, I'm buggin', put your knuckles out
And I can show you better than I can tell you
Now'days I'm landing on fans like Miguel do
I put it all on the bread, that's  nigga
Open up your chest like I'm lookin' for some treasure nigga
I'mma let you ride but keep your shit together nigga
Now don't touch the radio or dirty up my leather nigga
Got respect for El and Chef, both are dear to me
All y'all other rap niggas scared of me
They said don't fuck with battle cause they wouldn't blow
Now I just got more than you got paid for a show, wow

I'mma bad ma'fucka, rush niggas: Chris Tucker
More harder than the ruckus, make your bitch lips pucker
Baby boy against god, these bars is boxcutters
Tiger with the putter's slick, t-t-t-talk a stutter
When I'm bustin' out the Magnum I ain't talkin' 'bout the rubbers
When I'm tuckin' these lames I ain't talkin' 'bout covers
I divorced the game and remarried the ma'fucka
Shit I'm cumming on myself, who wanna be my baby mother?
Pause, Giant Andre, y'all bitches fianc
LL Cool ain't nobody beyond Jay
Red dots on heads, it's Queens and not Bombay
Get a angle on you, leave your forehead concave
Three decades gettin' the bricks shaved
Gettin' their whips paid, you  switchblade
Rambo to your jugular, fuckin' baloney smugglers
Nobody's fucking with me, tell the morgue come and get me


Oh, yea, I'm nice nigga
Yea, yea, I'm nice nigga

Yea, yea, I'm nice nigga
Oh, yea, I'm nice nigga
Yea, yea, I'm nice nigga
You don't think so?
I think your bitch think so




 He looks determined without being ruthless. Something heroic in his manner. There's a courage about him. Doesn't look like a killer. Comes across so calm. Acts like he has a dream. Full of passion
 You don't trust me, huh?
 Well, you know why
 I do, we're not supposed to trust anyone in our profession anyway


Knock niggas out the box all the time. Bitches know my mothafuckin' repertoire, big one. Yeah, mothafucka, straight up, I'll fuck your whole team up. Take care of B.I., Chef. Yeah, bust it, fly G.I. niggas


Now, yo! Yo, what up? Your time is running out
It's for real though, let's connect politic, ditto
We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases
Word up, peace, incarcerated scarfaces


My thug-related style attract millions, fans
They understand my plan, who's the kid up in the green Land?
Me and the RZA connect, blow a fuse, you lose
Half-ass crews get demolished and bruised
Fake be fronting, hourglass heads niggas be wanting
Shutting down your slot, time for pumping
Poisonous sting, which thumps up and act chumps
Rae's a heavy generator, but yo, guess who's the black Trump?
Dough be flowing by the hour's, Wu, we got the collars
Scholars, Word Life, peace to Power and my whole unit
Word up, quick to set it, don't wet it
Real niggas lick shots, peace Connecticut


Now, yo! Yo, what up? Your time is running out
It's for real though, let's connect politic, ditto
We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases
Word up, peace, incarcerated scarfaces


Chef'll shine like marble, rhyme remarkable
Real niggas raise up, spend your money, argue
But this time is for the uninvited
Go 'head and rhyme to it, bitch nigga mics is getting fired
Morphine chicks be burning like chlorine
Niggas recognize from here to Baltimore to Fort Greene
But hold up, Moet be tasting like throw-up
My mob roll up, dripped to death whips rolled up
You never had no wins, sliding in these dens
With Timbs, with Mac-10's and broke friends
You got guns? Got guns too, what up, son
Do, you wanna battle for cash and see who sons who?
I probably wax, tax, smack rap niggas
Who fax, niggas' lyrics is wack, nigga
Can't stand unofficial, wet tissue, blank busting Scud missles
You rolling like Trump, you get your meat lumped
For real, it's just slang rap democracy
Here's the policy, slide off the ring, plus the Wallabees
Check the status, soon to see me at, Caesar's Palace eating salads
We beating mics sending ki's to Dallas
I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell
From staircase to stage, minimun wage
But soon to get a article in Rap Page
But all I need is my house, my gat, my Ac
Bank account fat, it's going down like that
And pardon the French but let me speak Italian
Black Stallion, wildling on Shaolin
That means the island of Staten
And niggas carry gats and mad police from Manhattan


Now, yo! Yo, what up? Your time is running out
It's for real though, let's connect politic, ditto
We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases
Word up, peace, incarcerated scarfaces


I do this for barber shop niggas in the Plaza
Catching asthma, Rae is sticking gun-flashers
Well-dressed, skating through the projects with big ones
Broke elevators, turn the lights out, stick one upstairs
Switch like a chameleon, hit Brazilians
Pass the cash or leave your children, leave the building
Niggas, yo, they be folding like envelopes
Under pressure, like Lou Ferrigno on coke
Yo, Africans denying niggas up in yellow cabs
Musty like funk, waving they arms, to Arabs
Sit back, cooling like Kahlua's on rocks
On the crack spots, rubberband wrapped on my knots
View bitches who fuck dreads on Sudafeds
Pussy's hurting, they did it for a yard for the Feds
Word up cousin? Nigga, I seen it
Like a 27-inch Zenith, believe it


Now, yo! Yo, what up? Your time is running out
It's for real though, let's connect politic, ditto
We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases
Word up, peace, incarcerated scarfaces




Don't see Kay in these motherfuckin' streets dog
Nigga walkin' around in this motherfucker lookin' shocked and stupid, baby
We runnin' these motherfuckin' streets for real
Kay Slay, holla at God damn baby
Kay Slay, they don't want me out here
They don't want you out here, dog
This is motherfuckin' Face Mob, Kayslay, New York City
Holla at ya God damn baby, we don't rock no motherfuckin' ice, baby
We rock this real shit, dog
And if you think a nigga bullshittin', come fuck wit it
It's goin' down...


Let's put an ending to chatter, nigga, see me in gloves
I'm the poof in the booth, bitch, read it in blood
It's Face at you, freezin' motherfuckers like a statue
I got a loaded Kay Slay pointed at you
The end of your beginning, before you even get it started
You fucked up, now you in the presence of a heartless
Nigga, from out the gutter, spit it and don't stutter
I'm a gangsta, raised around the dope fiends and hustlers
But silence is golden, and the streets don't talk
Don't let shit slide, cause beef don't walk
We attack hoes, fuck a nigga with wack flows
I'm the last of a dying, bitch, act like you don't know
I'm the reason you niggas walk around thug
Just remember I'm the one made, you can get touched
So what you fittin to put a record out, you a motherfuckin sellout
Slay told me to knock your ass out


And you was right, I never liked ya motherfuckin' ass
To start with, you know it's better get your self regardless
And Kay, bitch, you picked the right nigga to play with
Now you got a leakin' T-shirt from the chay spit


Snow white five glendin', the elevator with the crib
Blend with it kid, I feel one of them Bill Clinton's
Mills is spent, still don, still rentin'
Still yacht flyin', still killin' fish, still killin' clicks
The fifth out, don't even breathe out
And ganna with the ill thieves, slick hammers, we all fam
What, pull out the four, pop the truck, see the luxury morgue
The casket leather, the python seeks your dog
Flashback, he and them Benz's lenses
Actin' like he did ten sentences, son ain't real
He got excited, parked the truck, just leaned the lighter
Twist the blunt, sat back, son beepin', we drove off
It's money on it, until them young niggas don on it
Devour the snitches, you get on, you born with it
Make a toast for hours, for all the money and power
The right division, don't never let corns get it, drama




Pass the rock, you niggas gassed a lot
I never liked ya ass, but then again, you can't be shocked
Most feared in this rap game, and ain't for frontin'
Best believe when shit pop off, I'm blazin' somethin'
It's the J to the Izzo, you know the rest
Nigga can't get a Twiz-o, but flow the best
I've been doin' this for years, ruinin' careers
Niggas never wanna listen til the toolies in the air
It's the kid that don't be givin' a fuck, I hold a shit outta grudge
The type of nigga that'll spit at the judge
Niggas gettin' gelled, they say I'm livin' it up
Cuz I'm at Hollywood with Denzel, flickin' it up
I play the corner when the shit is hot, summer time in the X
Kay Slay got the shit on lock
That's where you go to find the God body
Second to none, unless you compare him to John Gotti, God...






Sometimes I feel like a nigga ain't good enough
Paint art but these niggas don't look enough
Single parent home moms ain't cook enough
Use to sell weed but I didn't push enough

I was too busy in the stu cooking up
Looking up, to the sky, like look at us
Look at Raz with the Lo' sport gear on em
He been the man for his balls had hair on em

And he see his niggas going down the wrong roads
But he can't steer for em so he say a prayer for em
Then blow smoke in the air for em in em air
Jordans these pair really rare I don't wear often

Often caught in dreams of lake shore lofting
Blowing loud green Al Green playing yo
Niggas wanna see me beneath soil and rejoice
In the recoil, as my hearts stops..
In this Game I see me on top my girl asked what
About her I said I see me on top brandish
The watch, the dot stay in me like a scatter plot
Master Plan Pac strictly for my niggas yeah

Influenza sickness lighting the Buddha you now eyeing
The Lion of Judah, every rhyme is a rugger I let my
Guess jeans hang like a booger, thats nasty
Tryna be the mansa musa of the future

Stanza's is the coolest no Santa's where we cooling
Started at the bottom and we there still trooping my
Blueprint making def jams Rick Rubin's
Invested in gold assets Mark Cuban's

..Stupid muthafuckas had me on they snooze list
Now I'm on they boo's who's who list, do this
For people who love that hip hop shit the flows back
Everyone else can suck dick you can quote that


I hear you young prince gather your thoughts
Stay at course where you stay fly, get rich and blow like a horse
I heard the hood hated, your lab it was gated
Them 400 keys I sent, you graduated

Stay protected, and don't be fucking em raw
They know you got money now just cum in they jaw
And those Colombians we fuck with, them niggas my sons
The next months heroine just bring out the guns

We independent, word got back we in the pen with it
Don't see me activated, then I'm suspended
I'm just parleying potato the mack up and braying
Hope niggas test mine I'm out for the slaying

Just keep ya dome straight fake niggas living with hate
They know who go real with it just listen to Rae
Take it from me king, speak truth its real in the clinks
Guess who put you on only built 4 Cuban Linx


Sat back polyin fresh to the mausoleum
Chamber, Ryu kicks wit 3 vegas the
Baker n the chef shine like Vegas
He call me 88 cause I got that og flavour

I'm like Mussolini in a polo beanie rock the gold Linguine
Roped up poster boy of the rich porters of the
New era, theraflu games, flame sporter
Insert quarters on em dames swerve Daytona all my
Niggas in the field I feel like a slave owner
BC OG O.Z.'s better then California since a
Toddler, Cash Rules, study black mobsters

Wu Tang Clan Gambinos of the culture
Crown me, ultra, like the UV, ulcer
Sick shit, need million dollar offers cause
Two and two makes four crystal crazily poured
We slice cats hold the mic like sword




The modern day, multi-rap, Penny Hardaway
Allah's way, God's day, Range in the garage way
Freak this, slap meat on this uniqueness
Relax overseas status black beat your feet to this
The grim style Role' sundial, Sun of a Man who went
Foul spent, ten thou' on jewels, 80 cent on Loud
Slang lord, applaud, forty-eight up on the board
Holding the stainless plain sword with ya name on it
Lord, burn 'em, ninety-eight degrees Celsius
Go for delf, no breaks, from stealth, crash it on the belt
Almost lost the eagle, the diamond gem I paid 30 legal
Crash the bird, cranberry regal
Stepped off, double oh-eight style
Bubble the tape out, real niggas who kill bless the weight style
The treasure map stash billions, smash a class of Sicilians
Glassy watch flooded out for trillions
A million dollar lawsuit, got paid and swayed you
And floored you flowerhead niggas lost you
What? Faggots, come up over here
We got it all and I'm the holy child of war


I know niggas who carry guns like
The same way the Earth keep in sunlight
With no fight, snatch your ice, sell it in Crown Heights
We grab mics, Malcolm X type, Israelites
From the poor like, holy war type
We got your lost wife
Loving me, fuck the bubbly, it's the drugs in me
Cover me, I want his company, and all the currency
They out to live luxury, cheat and lie, die comfortably
Nautica Rugby's like Seagal Bugsy
Y'all disgust me, Nia Long sisters want me
A King David strong country, we still be hungry
Too many rap braggarts back stabbers, abracadabras
Get hit by the golden daggers (bring it!!)


Intellectual, rhyming professionals
Bring all the ladies, in my directional
Intellectual, rhyming professionals
Bring all the ladies, in our directional
Intellectual, rhyming professionals
Intellectual, rhyming professionals
Intellectual, rhyming professionals
Bring all the ladies, in our directional


Inevitable, fed of all rhymes, like vegetables, yo
And when I let go, the deny the oaths, amigos
Lessons be stressing the fact without question
Determining who gives who, a slap to a westman
Bugging while smuggling, lyrics cold bum-rushing
Touching your brain leaving it, left, while recovering
Tagged, by the fact they rap the daily contract
And ac-cessory the best of me flipping void and fast crack


My attitude is metal, I'm rotten to the veins
Saber-toothed tiger in the booth still remains
You see let it be let your soul feel free
And disdained with the horror from the powers that be
And it's grabbing me, jabbing me
Stabbing me, imagine me trapped
Fully packed anti, combat, gravity rap that
The A-Alike attracts and, Hunchback chills
The sinner's to gain reveal, Homicide Hill
The thunder style underground, Plymouth Rock
The loud mouth grouch in your house, Comstock
The curser, verse with the worser thirster frantic
The felony's swelling me, telling me to push the panic


Living in the world today
Making room for our seeds to see a brighter day
Who's to say real thug niggas don't pray
That's why we drop jewels, we drop jewels
C'mon, living in the world today
Making room for our seeds to see a brighter day
Who's to say real thug niggas don't pray
That's why we drop jewels, we drop jewels


Cause we drop jewels
We catch it, if you don't I sit
Nothing but jewels
Living in the world today
Living in the world today
We drop jewels, we drop jewels
Locked up for 13 years
The album
Sunz of Man is out, what?
Bring it bring it
South coming, intellectual, rhyming professional
Ladies and children
Everybody facing our directional
We coming like a storm
Be in the night, everybody ask when the album gon' drop
Here it is? want this?
Sunz of Man, Prodigal Sunn, Hell Razah
60 Second Assassin, Killah Priest, Raekwon, U-God
This is how we do it
You don't want it




Intoxicated and I'm faded, by your honey
Why, we finally made it, got to lovin'
Money, seeds and shine
They want to hate it, try to break it
But it's yours and mine
Nothing can change it, finally made it, so divine


Yo, I sat around the illest villains
Campaignin' while we all G off
Automatic mayors, now we ain't playin'
Wolves start scheemin', violate me in the rain
Get more respect, rob Marvin Gaye on 'em
Gold, black, beige on 'em, heavy gauge
Gettin' blazed, all that money, but he ain't even shaved
This a new flavor, bigger vets, bigger begets
Bigger papes, god damn it, nigga got saved
Three or more, two thousand four Blazers
Lookin' good, it's all hood, just analyze amazed
Peace, let's mozy and swaze', y'all
Then count real bank and thank 'em, hit me on the page, what



Yo, I was born on the same day as Dr. Seuss
Plenty of friends, henny and gin, who got the juice?
Let's get drunk, in this motherfucker, let's get pumped
I need that funk, like I ain't took a bath in a month
You can find me where the thugs be at, club be at
A fact, I love women, 'cause they love me back
The name's Johnny, they used to call me sucker for love
But now I'm grimey, cops searchin' motherfuckers for drugs
Give me that buzz, that calm a nigga, dimes and doves
At four twenty, when niggas knew what time it was
A shot of Remy, in my system, I'm buzzed
Then baby, I ain't just a little war from unplugged
Haha, you know I, crack myself up, sometimes with no excuses
Like every nigga that done time, I didn't do it
Meth the Magnificent, not Jeff
I see the game done gone imputent, soft and suspect



Yo, silence on Smith with six shots, lick shots
Leave ya head like a Shaolin monk with six dots
Hit a gush, twistin' a sweet switcher
In search for Bobby the Digital, bitch, not Bobby Fisher
Head full, with a Grey Goose and Redbull
I came for, a beer, weed, plus a bed full
Of dimepiece, model type bitches, who mind they business
Blow my dick, like birthday cake wishes
My warrior's scornful, hard to respond to
Dirt McGirt, be sailin' boat and in Honolulu
Brooklyn Zu, wild like Chaka Zulu
Brooklyn Zu, shots will go right through you
Touch me in Cali, or the streets of Mauwi
In the two thousand six pitch black Audi
Drivin' by bitches, I'm like howdy
Doody, to you some beauty bitches crowd me

This paperwork is just fuckin' my eyes up. Shit is really based on politics, man

Yeah, they were right when we was in the street, huh?

You need some tissue, man?

Yeah

Shit is just real right now because, yo, everything count man. Everywhere you walk, a nigga gon' judge your walk. But only you can judge yourself at the end of the day, knowin' what the fuck is you doin'. A lot of niggas gotta see that man, immobilizing is the best thing right now coming from whatever we came out of, you know?

Yeah, but they don't make cats like you no more, baby. It's a different breed out here, know what I'm sayin'?

Indeed so

The world is yours though, baby. The world is yours

We got a plan though

The world is yours

We have no interests, no investments in anything illegitimate. Don't ever underestimate the power of forgiveness. This is real shit right here, I'm tellin' you

Mr. Raekwon and his associates is prepared to deposit 500 million dollars in the Rap Vatican bank. Such times as Mr. Raekwon and his associates receive majority control of the Immobilarity

Immobilarity? Immobilarity could be somethin' new, baby. It's a international conglomerate. A few families have control of such companies. These are important things that a black man like myself and like others need to know. And that's gon' bring about nature. Nature takin' it's course. Come on, let's add on. What you feel? Talk to me

This is not a question of one person deciding one vote. It's not like any other company in the world! We have directors, we have rules, we have very old rules. I have a board I have to answer to, they have to approve you

Just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in



Woman: Passport please
Raekwon: Figaro platinum shit, man
Woman: Where are you traveling today? It seems you've run out of space on your passport. There's no place to stamp
Raekwon: I'm a soul train, catch me on more clear jets, nigga
Woman: Sir
Raekwon: Versace shower sprinklers, nigga
Woman: Excuse me, Mister Chef
Raekwon: Suede walls, Bally sneakers from '86
Woman: Chef can you hear me?
Raekwon: Brooks Brothers shit...
Woman: You've run out of space on your passport
Raekwon: ...London, nigga, Monte Carlo. The Caymans
Woman: I'm sorry sir but we won't be able to allow you to fly to Abu Dhabi today
Raekwon: Nigga we drink that mothafuckin' Dom Perignon
Woman: It's been , sir
Raekwon: Jeroboam, nigga, 1907 shipwreck, high chief, nigga
Woman: Excuse me, you don't have any more room in your passport to stamp, sir
Raekwon: Spike convertibles
Woman: Excuse me, we have other people in line
Raekwon: Fly International Luxurious Art



You want a Rolls Royce
You don't come here
No, no
You go to England
That's wherever the fuck they make it
If you want champagne
You go see the French
If you need money
You find a Jew
But
If you want dirt
Or scum buried under a rock somewhere
Or some secret nobody wants anybody to know about
There's only one place to go
Right here



The street is the only one that matters
Court is for uptown people
With suits, money
Lawyers with three names
If you got cash you can buy court justice
But on the street justice has no price
She's blind where the judge sits
But she's not blind out here
Out here the bitch got eyes




Here we go, come on


"A battle-A battle was fought, in Brooklyn..."
"Hessian Soldiers killed 3,000 men; much of the fighting took place in what is now Prospect Park in Green-Wood Cemetery as well as the Park Slope and Gowanus neighborhoods."
"This was the first battle of America."


Rugged rhymsters, crooked crimesters
Dime droppers, Twenty-five-to-lifers
Backstabbers, low blowers
Illegal... cocaine growers
Starvation, profanity
Anxiety, brothers trying me
Gun slingers, dead ringers


Yo, my slang's out of this world
Mix collaboration man, little man and his girl
Way of life got me thinking, plus I'm analyzing young
Youths on roofs, you know, three time felony brutes
Roll together, tropical trees puff, whatever
Yo we could go run up on, kids for leathers
What drug? Faculties bubble keys for G's
Cream flow like seven seas, hit chicks Guyanese
Word up, hold your head before you fall out
The morgue route, the devil want that
Let's get my niggas locked all out
Change for better, that be my only vendetta
With life, feed your seed right, he's breathing indeed right
Chef, remarkable, sparkable, raps and tackable gats
Never get jacked, see ya then move black
Paradise trife, plush with much ice
Getting nice, laying back, sleep all my life; word up!


"The battle of Brooklyn depicted was the bloodiest
Clash of the American revolution. Soldiers killed
3,000 men, much of the fighting took place in what is now..."


Crack patients, dime smokers
Vial carriers, mocha tokers
Burnt buildings, brothers building
Save the children, investigative reports!


Calling all cars, calling all cars! Ghetto
Psychos, armed and dangerous, leaving mad scars
On those who are found bound, gagged and shot
When they blast the spot, victims took off like astronauts
Get with this, even your best can't
Come on down, you're the next contestant!
Get your pockets dug from all your Chemical Bank ends
Caught him at the red light  on Putnam Avenue and Franklin
They used to heat up the cipher with a shot that was hyper
Than your average JFK sniper
He just came home from Spofford
Rolling like Kaufman, and laid that ass out like carpet
Stop the stuttering boy, save complaints for the five-oh
Then praise the God  chk-a-chk POW!
They release shots and premeditate to grab
And then they jet back to the lab
And then remain in Shaolin, an endangered island
Where shorties lose blood by the gallons


"Have integrated a number of corrupt cops, judges
...into high-level positions, to insure the continued
Success of the drug smuggling and money laundering operations"


Crack patients, dime smokers
Vial carriers, mocha tokers
Burnt buildings, brothers building
Save the children, investigative reports!


Yo, I grab the pen for revenge and let loose, see
Like Muslims, standing on the block, rocking a kufi
The hundred-dollar kick rocking kid's back for more
Starting gun wars, with black Reeboks and Velours
Jungle way of life, living villain
Packed with visions, copywritten
Throwing bread to pigeons, Christ has risen
King Elegant, slang master, jack expensive noodle hats
In sixty-nine, old timers time that brothers shot craps
The baggy blue Guess jeans, pull strings off in Palm Springs
I'm locked in the bing, Rocky ring labelled rap king
The corner emperor  the golden thieves play the benches
Rednecks be hanging big niggas down in Memphis
Back in Now-Y, hit the bull's eye with loaded nines
Life is like Tarzan, swinging from a thin vine
Shatter dreams, then mirrors don't need a press spirals
Aim at the white shadows with big barrels
Of Moet-ers, the bald headers, milk and Armarettas
Who fear none, crushing all personal vendettas, yo
They use guns while we angrily shot arrows
You better keep your eye on the sparrow


Rugged rhymsters, crooked crimesters
Dime droppers, Twenty-five-to-lifers
Backstabbers, low blowers
Illegal... cocaine growers
Starvation, profanity
Anxiety, brothers trying me
Gun slingers, dead ringers


"Have integrated a number of corrupt cops, judges and lawyers
Into high-level positions  to insure the continued success
Of the drug smuggling and money laundering operations"




No love for crowdads, them wheels is old mags
Factory joints, I sit back in gold glasses
Count mine out on the grind, slow motion
Blunts lit, guns is big, strong noses
Drinking Don Julio, playing spades
Got my knife out, chopping through duffle bags of haze
Pack the money, talking shit, watching Netflix, vibin'
My bitch is a Grecian, four five beside me
You know the drawer full of that cocaine
10,000 square feet of lab, I live with a cold flame
Her nickname is Cashis, her ass is jurassic
Black cards, wet clit, she classy
Know we from where the drugs be flown in
It's like Medelln here, you might get left in the cold wind
Bloodline is gangster, you niggas is wanksters
We kill for real, keep it moving and drink piss


I could never hate a man for being himself
I wish you nothing but the best in sickness and health
Through the battles and the travels and everything else
I call it how I see it, yeah, best believe I always say it
Cause it's true
No need to sugar coat it, we only say it cause it's true


Don't care whose eyes are on me, I'll air all my dirty laundry
I try to keep it classy, they try to say it's raunchy
They call me bald honky, eye brows like Sean Connery
But either way I get that thumbs up like Fonzie
All the way across seas, to the Long Beach palm trees
To the New York concrete, there ain't a place beyond reach
I planted seeds and my crop finally started sproutin'
I learn the art of rap, you learn the art of chokin'
You'll never see this artist frozen like the Arctic Ocean
With every  I've spoken, I put my heart and soul in
I'm too intelligent to say you fin to dumb it down
They tryna shut me up but every show I shut it down
How's that work, I go all out, I'm all in
In the jungle, late night, burning my stripes, diggin my claws in
I'm a tiger that's been brought up in a lion's den
But I'm still a product of my environment


I could never hate a man for being himself
I wish you nothing but the best in sickness and health
Through the battles and the travels and everything else
I call it how I see it, yeah, best believe I always say it
Cause it's true
No need to sugar coat it, we only say it cause it's true


They said D12 was a joke until we reached a million
Did it two more times, they sick we in the building
Can't stop momentum, no matter what you'll be kill 'em
Love to ODB, D12 is for the children
Can't knock cause Kuniva's only speaking the doctrine
From the prophet's point of view that'll only strengthen your conscience
Still enjoy when the bad chicks in my boxers
And hit the king off with some monster, that is proper
Can't snap out of my ghetto ways
A product of my environment, Fords and Chevrolets
And still manage to get caught up where the metal sprays
Cemetery where cold bodies and rose petals lay
It's all the same, worldwide, so the Henny gets swallowed
Back with the chaser, holler back with your paper
That's the only way they gonna hear ya, better yet, fear ya
Real recognize real and class is looking real familiar


I could never hate a man for being himself
I wish you nothing but the best in sickness and health
Through the battles and the travels and everything else
I call it how I see it, yeah, best believe I always say it
Cause it's true
No need to sugar coat it, we only say it cause it's true




I remember, I recall
I remember, I recall
I remember, I recall
I remember, all you said


Aiyo, yes sir, everything's a blessing, let the cess' splurge
Spill it in your hand, and let the s's turn
You got them wild style goons in the room, with nothing but coupes
And Pumas on, rugged beards, mean underwear
Fly in the day, high by night, money right
Solidified gangsta with his paintbrush writing
Catch me off Lenox, Spanish dip, vintage shit
Floating in the open, niggas smoking that shit, you know


Vanilla envelopes of cess, 20 bags of bless
Pissy drunk, in the project steps
Throwing dice, til the sun come out, guns come out
Trains through the 151 come out
Then it's back on the block, I'm running from the cops again
The old heads love me, asking when I'm gonna stop again
But, you know the law of the streets
How we gon' dick the freaks and what we do over beats, bitch




Yessa yessa, rap is under pressure
Had me, had 'em, hungry hoody, wearing hoods, come getcha
Four fetcha, eat tracks, Hannibal Lecter
Keep gats, Tony Jaa, still, I'm The Protector
Street speak, reach peeps, treat peeps aggressive
Smif-N-Wessun, Chef connection, nothing less than perfection
Peace number 7, God Degree's the lesson
Equality's the evanescense for my peeps in the essence


Fresh mohawk, run up in the gun store, blow off
Jump in the couple, sled range, my dame blow off
Bamboo need for the go, it's like chilly
Don't be silly, my niggas pop wheelies for dough


I tell you the first time, I ever laid hands on a pussy
Smack Earth, Wind & Fire out of jazz, pussy
That's when niggas learned to respect my army
Respect my gun and recognize me as a don


Listen, I tell no lies, spread no rumors
Have your whole family smothered, taking me for humor


Get your laugh from elsewhere, your bricks from right here
You bleed just like I bleed, so it's no fear


Aiyo, flatten niggas, what's happening, rap niggas from Staten
Gat chunky nine, bullets sitting in napkin
Ready to pop your lid off, lay low in Manhattan
Stop fronting, buttons get pressed, we jabbed 'em, tagged 'em






Murder one of y'all niggas..
Get to hurtin one of y'all niggas..
Bitches, snatch the shirt off one of y'all niggas
Kick dirt


Color Glocks splitters just listen there's UFO visitors
Fly paintings remainin, reclinin pro-comissioner
One boot off he Rudolph, know he hyped flew off
Hibernatin, dead in the makin, ear-rake him, gear-rake him
Technician murderer, Wu hit the universe
Our words is crush, fingers icy slush, ringers wants Mercedes bust
Tip bottles, Movado, sailin in some Wu goggles you follow
Mail and jail letters, sendin niggas lottos
What made you murder my flow, what made you rival my clothes
What made you  fuck it, yo son these niggas gotta owe
I think a lot of flows, I flip exotic hoes
We paintin pictures if it's was drizzies, seen a lot of those
Gettin fly with Ghost, Power just buy the boats
RZA your vision is exquisite, daddy hide your scrolls
Platonic chronic shows, tonic prose
Off the meter Panasonic know, son line me a ho


Devestatin shockwaves strikin the nation
Newsflash, warn the people, assassination
The hour of detonation, pure untampered or mixed in any form
In any form mixed untampered it's pure
Dissect each line of the rhyme
Find my ingredients and nutrients
Teach patience and obediance before movement
Killer bee student enrollment
I'm out your control and expose if it's synthetic
Quote these plush degrees as I inject, there's many at risk
Slang therapist Shallah Rae
Bless the people, with magnificent wordplay




Aiyyo you know the half, some get respect, most we show the path
They quoted tracks while we spoke math, blowin fast
Expose the craft, first picks chosen in the draft
I don't flash, hoes love me cause I hold a stash
Known to blast, paramedics couldn't close the gash
Floatin past in a 'Nail with the oak dash
Show the cash, watch it blow in half, it's no fair
They goin mad, check their tape recorders and their notepads
Crabs wanna play me close and grab
Can't believe you on the canvas, I'm just throwin jabs
Where the powers you supposed to have, hand in your soldier rag
You posin bad, show your ass son, you won't last
With heavy weights that elevate the whole mass
Compose a smash, rollin grass at Ghost lab

{*samples scratched: "drink to your new life.. iron flag brothers"*}




"What you doin' on our turf punk?

Motherf-cker, I said give me the message!

Yo, Gambino niggas who swipe theirs
Deluxe rap cavaliers
Midgets who steal beers, give 'em theirs
Sit back jollyin'
My team be gaming like Three-card Molly and
Drug Somalians pollying
Mittens raps they crocheting
A-yo Iron, these niggas portraying
But haven't been paying
For real, slide on these niggas like a fresh pair
Caesar fade style, usually tuck grenade
Throw a blade, fuck getting laid
Guzzle this shit like Gatorade
Day to day Wallies half leather, half-suede
Connecting with the high stylist, dun
Light up a chalice
I run with nothing but the wildest, foulest
Come on now, long-dick style
Niggas on the hit out, ay yo Iron bite my shit out
Eventually, bust a rap gun mentally
Been doing this a century kid, just meant to be
Get on your knees and bless me with a gem in the Caribbean
Skiin' off white (?)
Snatch Canadian cream with Scandinavians
Palladium style, play it like thirty-two Arabians
The greatest lesson is don't owe, you might get stole on
When I go bury me with velour on

[They come to me, and understand, just let me get mines first. Then after I
Get mines, y'all can do what y'all wanna do. Fuck 'em up bad]


'Sho 'nuff, hit the Bank and thrust
Wu Nauticas Jamie Sommer got trained on the tour bus
We upgrade, swallow raw eggs, read the label
Hitting white-label, left the Winnebago unstable
Smooth sailing, walked in, my Earth start kneeling
Started stealing, I'm too ill, see we're grilling at the parlay
Kicked up, mack, max motion
Michael Bolton magazine quote, I'm too potent
Louisville mix pain kill rap
Fuck benadryl the violin in 'Knowledge God' sounded ill
Tremendously obnoxious, no blotches
My telephone watch'll leave bartenders topless
Dead arm the prosecutor, smack the juror
Me and my girl'll run like Luke and Laura
We sit back on Malayan islands
Sipping mixed drinks out of broke coconut bowls, we wilding


Sit back jollyin' (ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha)
Sit back jollyin' (ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha)
Sit back jollyin'

Drug Somalians pollyin'
Sit back jollyin'
My team be gamin' like three card Rolly an'
Drug Somalians pollyin'
Sit back


Deep meditation sound orientated, war the blizzard
Rap paramedical the wizard
Cappadonna, never catering to none
My microphone and three verse weigh a ton of slaughter
You order five thousand back across the water
My laboratory story keep me flowing with the glory
Acapella or deep dirty instrumental
I could blow the sky like the stormy wind blew
One gallon of wilding, Park Hill profiling
I cut your face a Buck 50 sure why you smiling?
For violating my position
I leave you smoked like a crackhead on a mission
Two tokes of mic dope, one stroke of elegance
Rated like the movie graphic told intelligence
Person to person, it'd be hard for you to take a trophy
You better off to get somebody out to try to smoke me
Cause I'm PLO TKO every day
Dancehall General, Party Fanatic Colonel
Cappadonna son'a old school Disco Inferno
Veteran for rapping with the new set of Wu the hard rapping
Ninety-six jive, I keep the live crowd clapping
When I bow, all praises due to Staten Isle
I spark the mic and Shaolin spark the methtical
Every evening, I have a by myself meeting
Thinking who's gonna be the next to catch a beating
From my mental slanging, bitching rap twist the point of warfare
I brutalize, all competition catch hell here
Chance him, that's what they said, threw up a ransom
I jacked it, stripped the beat naked and packed it
Gimme my rewards


[The way I, the way I wanna get 'em. I want 'em gotten. I want 'em layin'
Out. I want 'em gotten. Cause niggas need to be got. He need to be
Taken off of here. That's right.]




Strong Isle, Staten Isle, Stapleton to Little Bricks
Cook coke, stack dough, we all make that money flip
(Aiyo, Po', get money, nigga) Island 2 Island
(Keep stacking them ones, man) Island 2 Island
Strong Isle, Staten Isle, Stapleton to Little Bricks
Cook coke, stack dough, we all make that money flip
(This is real nigga shit, man) Island 2 Island
(Shaolin, we cousins, nigga) Island 2 Island


Cash rules, snatch jewels, flash tools, breeze through
Remind you that I'm high to, this is what life do
Cook coke, cut throats, Po' got the best smoke
Inject them with the raw dope, contact from haze smoke
Days in a trench coat, shit I'm broke
Niggas on the prowl, with these rich hopes, target these rich folks
Big, have a type of dough, jack 'em in the Range Rov'
Bodies in the back row, grind through the hood, slow
Eyes on that money flow, infer from the block, ho
Bricks say he gotta go, call Boots, we gotta roll
Hit 'em high then hit 'em low, count it on the way home
Sliding in the hoop dog, listen to Snoop Dogg
Man, I'm ready to die, homey, throw that Big on
Crime on my mind, like it's right, but I know it's wrong
Niggas said to drop dime, cuz we putting hits on 'em
Flip on 'em, I'm known as the boy with the grip on 'em




Aiyo, you put your hand on 'em, I'm bodying you, just like the Gotti crew
Brand new shotty blew, rubbergrip, tommy tool
Bust off, find me duke, ain't no place you can hide
Cuz I'm behind you, right there, reminding you
Real niggas carry burners, all of us, black fatigues
What it be like, we money niggas serving drugs
Cash rule burglars, that's cool, work with us
Nikes on, Champs shirts, Champion work for us
Everybody cock blocking, fly nigga, stop shopping
FBI keep clocking, niggas owning meat markets
Sorta like fish markets, all my niggas wrist sparkle, I'm fair
Play me one time, I'mma piss park you
Niggas go to sleep, yea, niggas that'll leap on your ear
And throw a slug in your mouth, and put your meat there
Roll that beat clear, me, Po', wrestle your streets
So if you need us, you better have your heat near





Chorus: (Superb)
If you don't stand for this life you fall for anything
I stand for Cream Team, see we plan our dreams
Shit ain't a game, we don't run game, we run businesses
Watch us shine and watch the World be our witnesses
(repeat)

Verse 1: (Raekwon)
Observe real though
Half cieling of blow
Robert Deniro dough
Gun dalero yo
Let the steel blow
Hear me yo, wild trump style
Dons connect three hundred ones wow
Floatin' like a maccarel, thats foul
Most craziest, laziest
All eye seein', blaze this majorness
Mechanic record on a beige disc
Pain, whatever level bankrolls
Frequent plain clothes
Lex spit six, arrange those
Snot nose pros
Dark skin hoes
Crazy ill fly jersey Expos
Neck froze
Fuck your set, slash vetos
Still Lex knows
Gasoline jumper on with the most fly livest Gortex made in Mexico
Bricks Fifteen Five
Celine Dion ties
Two Thousand dollar bubble eyes
Yo, the theme cries
Rollin' for cream yo now watch the laser beam rise
Sling pies
Doin' our thing high

Verse 2: (Baby Thad)
The chain of command is effective immediately, the cause and effect
It calls for your death
Black suburbans at night with no lights ram you off Hollywood Hills
Tearin' off the doors to your Lex
Steel Magnolia
Fear is takin' over ya
If you ain't bowlin' we rollin' straight over ya
If you ain't real about it don't talk
Hollow clips evict you, set supper for the Hawks
Send a missile at your ear like (whizz whizz) "what was it?"
Buzz the buzzers
Blow past with clutch buckets
They'd rather not see you in Malibu eatin' veal
Strength recognize strength, real recognize real
Chorus 2x

Verse 3: (Chip Banks)
It ain't a game dick
You know us, European whips
Chain frost bit
Peter pay Paul now pay the boss kid
Heavens to murgatroyd, even
Sent the heat rash to your camp, left his shirt there now you barely
Breathin'
Slow leakin'
Look at your people weepin'
I ain't have to quickdraw Mcgraw you I could Fifty Two block you
Switch my stance up Southpaw, drop you
You got small digits, your riches is midgets to mine
You sip Ballantine, I'm crown Royale
Sit back laughin' while ya'll plans foyale
Ya'll funny style, you'll never make it to trial
It ain't a game kid

Verse 4: (Rhyme Recca)
World premier, metal gear
Fanfare, stand clear
All jokes aside, this is our year
Still here for real ya'll, bare witness
This is business
NewYork City's sickness
Simple street principle
Cream team invincible
Money interchangable
Bulletproof Benzes
Ralph Lauren lenses
Soldiers in the trenches
Expansion
Four car garage, mini-mansion
Consolidated regiment
Connects like the President
Excellent
Rock waves with Three Sixty measurements
Chrome rims, new timbs
Exotic chains with red gems
Real estate
Corporation mindstate
Prosperity
Dealin' with the highest of integrity
Steadily, wall street bound
Walkin' on Holy ground
Give is the greatest of all, I spread my love around
Young black multi, this ain't a game son, we run businesses

Chorus 2x

Verse 5 (RZA)
I burst like a seed crackin' through the earth
Flower blossomin'
For your rhyme sickness spittin' anti-toxin
Best merk
Get your neck jerked
Dynamic mic teck squirt
Lyrics splurt blast the expert
To his head 'till his legs hurt
Knees become wobbly
King got love-love, born equal equality
Bring bodily harm, probably bust a brain artery
Kidnap the track
I could rap to the high hats
My widescreen imax lyric spread until the climax
Wu instrumental breaks scratch past the aftertake
Live performance concert, make shorty wop masturbate
In the tub legs open water be rushin' from the faucet
Thinkin' about the Wu-Tang gang bang she almost lost it
I move from the blood marked turf
Where the heart hurts
And merk to the heavily refined hills where the God lurks
Everyday I'm countin'
Son, my thoughts can move a mountain
So much joy in his eyes he'll make you cry a fountain
You purse snatch while I earth snatch and take the earth back
Have you runnin' like Devils bein' chased by the church




I know why you're here...
You wanna test out hard with my kung fu
(No, I've come here -- and I need your help
Your steel darts, you still have them?)
What for? (because they have guns
That kill up to a hundred yards, very powerful)
My darts could beat a pistol?
(You wanna help or not?)
{Duh-deh-duhn... live and direct
We got the connect, we gonna ride
Deh-duh-duh-deh-duhn... deh.. deh..}

"It's what it is!"


No question, sensational dart, no dollar superbs
Spoken word slang, throw them with perfection
Slick when he talk, simplistics, stand exquisite
Tiger palm smack ground, one man down
Got a few that'll kill right now
Bring his crown back with Kunta, one-two
The truth and the square, dare any man to stare
Down the eye of the barrel, like a needle to the camel
You will never enter, nuff ammo
Shaolin Finger Jab, stab the man running
Deadly sold delivery, stunning poetry
For the masses, solid liquid gasses
Gather to a bomb explosion, Sony eruption
Frontin' on Pelon, Lei Long'll get you swung on
Long barrel spinning rims on something foreign
Semi-auto flow spit forty five in the left grip
Right hold the mic tight, strike
With the force of Mike, when I'm speaking


Straight from the Hall of Justice, Hummers
Dirty bones, black 'Didas, black reefer in jars
We fly militant, brilliant thinkers, tanks
Yo, pull it together while we guzzle these drinks
We armed veterans, holding up swords
Driving Alfo Romeos, breaking down Sicily yayo
We seen the drama, drawing these heaters on cheaters
Shooting at bitches, hopping up domes for weight
We wild style gorillas, fly apes caught in Botanical Gardens
Trying to get back to the States
The harder they come, the harder we scrape
We coming back in jet lears, flying through the Tri-Boro today
What's really good, live niggas go up beside niggas
Mad bullets sit in your hood
We titanium vets, with jet fuel, vision the biz
We orchestrated like no other, word to mother


Say, why'd you have to ask me, there are many experts
(I know you, you're my brother
Also your darts are pretty formidable)
Heh, I must admit, it's fast as the speed of light


Yo, I rock a black mask, homemade bottle of Goose
Toney moonshine his miracle herbs and African roots
Blow suits, slap A&R's, tapered your jaw
Had you chopping off your body parts like this was Saw
Cut raw, got the Fishscale flooding the streets
And Masta Killa's blowing girders outta crystal sheets
Slay beats, just the Verra' boss, Wu-Tang Holocaust
Fuck around, leave you with a mouth full of murder sauce
Broken, hanging off the cross with one nail in
Chuck meat, ya chicken bones is looking real frail and
Heavy, my seventy seven got suicide doors, my wrist
Chirped up with pretty rocks, with no flaws
Guns stay barking like pitbull spiting, it's frightening
How Ironman, ricochet lightning
Bob and weave, duck and squeeze
Why ya'll can't pop holes in the kids, holla!

"It's what it is!"
"It's what it is!"




Machine gun Rap for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, linebacker nigga flash stacks
See through yellow lines, rock a fly jersey in the summertime
God, magic marker rap, bleed betadine relaxed
Wrote this, coming at you crab ass culprits
Snatch ya ice off, chilling in the back, throw the lights off
Waves, water blend, rhyme flow in slow motion
Thick snare, I'm feeling like a snail in the ocean
What's your wish? Wanna Kringle like Kris? Melodic single darts
Snap a nigga just like fish, you fucked up
Some rich niggas you done test, yo
Select the wrong apartment and niggas pulled up your dress
Style, molest that, Canal chain, nigga where ya vest at?
Flex'll make me wanna bless that, yo
Saddam Hussain niggas, light the torch, we flaming niggas
Autograph that, flatten all the main niggas


(It's Yours!)
The world in the palm of your hand
(It's Yours!)
Twenty-three million of useful land
(It's Yours!)
The seed and the black woman
(It's Yours!)
Double LP from Wu-Tang Clan
(It's Yours!)


Yo, super freak physique like Raphael Saadiq
Baby love the ganja leaf everyday of the week
Super friends wake up, deluxe gourmet beats
The night is right, I might find me a suite
It's a quarter full moon, I arrive, women swoon
Well groomed, dance hall packed, full room
Lady move, peep my glide, peep my zoom
Keep in stride, smoke the lye smoke the boom
Feel the fumes, consume toxic tunes
Hell bound, species forty ounce typhoon
The ultra-violet scream machine move your body touch
The totem pole wobble, Ark builders, God's thrust
Beams of light, stop ya breathing, it's hunting season
Honey eye-balling down for no reason
Grab her close, play post, wind and wax floors
Never mind the laws cause tonight It's yours


Stop the fader of the RAM, blast more watts through my pre-amp
Them can't stress the beat vamp the shit'll get blamp
At full throttle, hot lead propels throughout my nozzle
Crack your soul like bottles, leave you stiff as models
You fag, you couldn't pull one drag off my blunt
You couldn't punch your way out of a wet paper bag
With scissors in your hands bitch the RZA
I stand close to walls, like Number 4 The Lizard
And channel through solar panels, blast off like Roman Candles
Rap vandals, stomp your ass like Wahoo McDaniel
You cocker spaniel dogs, can't fuck with our catalog
Put your lights out and leave your brain inside a fog


It's only natural, actual facts are thrown at you
The impact will blow trees back and crack statues
Million dollar rap crews fold, check the sick shit
Explicit, I crystallize ya rhyme till you can sniff it
We live this, fitted hats low conceal the crooked eye
No surprise, verbal stick up, put 'em high
Rebel I outlaw, split second on the draw
Blow the door off this shit like bricks of C-4




Check out my beaver, baby blue Glock in the safe
Seen Dorothy in the garden getting ski row eight
We hold a belt Son, that's my word
Spot a rapper run him down, throw him out in the third, yo check it
I think like the man behind a register
Evergreen smoking estates, Divine and Power made me treasurer
With third down, six to go flash his strobe lights
I'm open, RZA hit me off lovely and I love him
With root beer thoughts, here's a tennis court for your birthday
The babyface of Rap politic with Sade
Avenging eagle crooks, rock the "W" and "Spiegel" books
Anheuser-Busch kings came through and stopped your whole Juks
Spitfire Kangols, watch Tony train a gang of hoes
Painful like hearing the news, like when your man go
Ends blow, windy at times watch the room
Sexy girl love the shit out the song, now watch her water break




Real niggas in the house
You already know
Niggas sit down and play pool and shit
Relax
What niggas don't know inside the muthafucking
Pool balls is nothing but blow
We gettin' money nigga. You already know boy
Toast off nigga lets go man c'mon


Raised off a knucklehead block, you know the pattern
Black Reeboks all day, let's be it captain
Posing in ostrich, woolrich Galoshes
Clear gazelles crush diamonds in the boxes
Wave game spiral, sneaker game rival
Front on me, see twenty-four Caligos
Drug niggas I hang with, hold up let me change shit
Feds is listening, calicoes rang quick
Thugs blow alcohol, white bitches, tap'em all
So fuck the ass or something, yup pass it off
Icy in the ass mints, so much dough it's elastic
Fuck with the Jews, Crews, and black bits
Might break a man, the heart that'll shake a man
Smack the bones out of ya skin, wake up fam
We the veterans, so many little niggas feather skin
One corny dub, drown you in your letter kid
Necks look thirsty, whats the word, reimburse me
Two techs on his neck, burst sweet he check writing liars
Pull the gold out of your mouth with rusty pliers
Take down the flyers nigga


Yo, yo, you already know what is nigga
This is not a game, this is not televised
This some shit that happened on a train nigga
Most powerful of them all nigga
Don't make me snatch your heart out your champion shirt nigga


Hey, I'm from the home of the cop killers
Raised to be a rotten nigga
Rob nigga, shot ninja
You know I got that small in me
"Real Deal" Holyfield, they not authentic
Nah, these niggas half-baked crab cakes
Bitch is baby Jesus, I could sneeze and make a ground shake
Show no pity, charging city niggas out-of-town rate
While you little niggas sending wayne on an ounce plate
I'm in my house shoes, making major boss moves
Dead alone, make the wrong move it'll cost you
Old cats want they corner back, you know how Moss do
They trying to keep up with him
You starve and eat dust nigga
I'm starting to heat up nigga
Then shout "what up nigga"
What's for dinner? This is Chess not Checkers
Real finesse, a nigga trying to molest the system
Black Mamba in jungle possessed with venom
D farmer and I stalk the rest is history


We from a small house, dropping off an eight ball
To a big deal, thirty-six mil up in my escrow
You walk up with your chest swoll, make it deflate
Been getting keys since we were wearing a Enyce
Now cool what we do, thirty-eight special in my boot
I shoot you from my shoe nigga
My wife say it's a shame how I do niggas
I say "you want me to starve them out"
She say "nah boo, get'em"
So that why I'm a handle all you niggas
Like the bitch that you are
Don't make me get you out that car and get to going in that shit
While you poppin' off? At point you knowing with this shit
We roll up slow and get you hit, pull up in morning with this shit
Or wherever, know that's not where you better be at
Or else, tell your momma pick the casket herself
Hope it make her feel better, you were dead the first year
He ain't suffer but he still a dead muthafucka
Ain't no bullets in the gun, you know you scared muthafucka
And I'm still a Bankhead muthafucka
With the plum for the low, for the bread muthafucka
I said I'm still a Bankhead muthafucka
With the plum for the low, for the bread muthafucka


They say Yo B
Hustle Gang G.D.O.D
Raekwon the chef
T.I.P the King
We cold to cold with this shit man
East Coast, West Coast, Midwest
Mid-Alantic, North East, Down South
Patna I got the boy cold
Come seem me
Fatality




Chill chill chill, let 'em rhyme, man
You know what it do man, just sit back, relax
Yelawolf what up?
Raekwon in the building


I'm Alabama's own, buddy
Flintstone Caprice, 1987 Cuddy
Backyard moonshine steel, methadone laboratory real
Can I keep it crystal clear
Chipped tooth type of people
Illiterate pigs who wanna see you killed type of evil
Confederate flags, I see 'em
On a truck with the windows down
Why is he playing Beanie Siegel
Cause his daddy was a dope man
Lynyrd Skynyrd didn't talk about moving keys of coke man
Ain't no such thing as a free bird
Billy's got that street work
And he's packing a nasty heater
Trailer home trap spot
Chevys on the cinder blocks
Still doing donuts in the gravel parking lot
Gold ropes, cousins in a group home
And he knows every word to every Yelawolf song, bitch


I wish a motherfucka would
Tell me that I ain't hip-hop
Bitch you ain't hip-hop
I wish a motherfucka would
Tell me that my shit gonna flop
Bitch your shit gonna flop

Tell me that I ain't hip-hop
Bitch you ain't hip-hop

Hell, naw, I wish a motherfucker would


Now let me tell you somethin' youngsters

Unless it's that snow white
We might mail you something
Me, I'm straight raw hood with it
Be at your door quick
Four on your jaw, I gotta new lick
My clique a murderer niggas who love hip-hop
You fuck with Yelawolf and them niggas, your head goin' pop
I'm just sincere, fresh cut
All up in the leer, listen
Yo leave 'em alone, he brought me along
Rap, he got it, I'm the crew pilot
Flyin' trains, planes, automobiles: we bout it, bout it
Yo Wolf, I think they got you twisted flow
I got the biscuit on me spit in his face, I'm bout to piss on homie
Who dem niggas?
Just some Staten Island niggas
You could call us Shaolin
Where niggas get drunk
And hold me down my nigga
Yelawolf, Alabama's vandal
Scramble, this is the true ramble
Aye yo give 'em yo' handle though


I wish a motherfucka would
Tell me that I ain't hip-hop
Bitch you ain't hip-hop

Tell me that I ain't hip-hop
Bitch you ain't hip-hop

Hell, naw, I wish a motherfucker would


I appreciate it Rae
Sling shot me in quick
Like Talladega Motor Speedway
King shit, blue ribbon rap
Baking sodas on the kitchen rack
Chef what you need these fiends gotta itchy back
Get busy crack
I'll be in the cut just call me Mr. Is he back
And you don't gotta call my black, I got direction
I'm a road map I'm an almanac
I'm in awe of these hogs who call on rap to ball and brag
Fuck all of that, Wu-Tang's in Bama bitch
Get a grip handle it, Yelas in the revival tent
Vandalist, Evangelist daddies got the cannabis
Make a wish the candles lit, White boys follow this
Mamas thirty-aught-six, long-range hollow tips
Trashed off the glue you build an airplane model with
In the gutter like an empty PBR bottle is


I wish a motherfucka would
Tell me that I ain't hip-hop
Bitch you ain't hip-hop
I wish a motherfucka would
Tell me that my shit gonna flop
Bitch your shit gonna flop
I wish a motherfucker would
Tell me that I ain't hip-hop
Bitch you ain't hip-hop
I wish a motherfucker would
Hell, naw, I wish a motherfucker would




My stripes show like regiments, military intelligence
Murder game, I leave no evidence -- credentials
Go ask my pre-school, even talk to my old principal
He'd tell you how you I used to pack a No. 2 pencil
Stabbing students, grabbing teachers, Catholics, preachers
In the school staircase, cutting class, passing my reefer
In my own class, operation return, they tried to say
I was incompetent, not able to learn
The table turned now, got my own label I earn
Like that nigga said in "Dead Presidents", money to burn
Queensbridge, pay homage respect, Nas is the vet
Acknowledge the rep, polish baguettes, niggas is this and that
I'm just the best, putting all violence to rest
Between Latin Kings the bloods los sangres, blood in Spanish
So many thugs vanish, unite the system
To fight with inner street wisdom, to help teach a prison


My crew puff lye, anyone test the Pun must die
Just give me one try
Now you know you done fucked up right
Hah, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
Que te pasa, you ain't even in my clasa
I hate an actor that plays a rapper
I'm Terror Squad beta kappa everybody's favorite rapper
Grand imperial, college material, insane criminal
The same nigga who known to blow out your brain mineral
I reign subliminal inside your visual
Try to supply your physical with my spiritual side of this lyrical
I'll appear in your dreams, like Freddie do, no kidding you
Even if I stuttered I would still sh-sh-sh-shit on you
Soon as I chitter chatter your shit'll shatter
I'm the kid out of Bronx, that'll stomp you to death like it didn't matter
I'm even better than before, iller metaphors
Killers bet it all on Pun, cause one verse, dead em all


J-J-J-John Blaze
Ja-Ja-ah-John Bla-Blaze
J-Ja-J-Ja, John Blaze
Johnny Blaze ain't a damn thing changed


Aiyyo my attitude is subject to change
I mess around and spit twelve at the driver's side door of your Range
Six hit you, the other six, up in your dame
Mafia style, leave you with your watch and your chains
Take heed that, not only can I flow I can aim
Cause y'all misdemeanor niggas can't stand the reign
Better believe that, whenever I see y'all I'ma test ya
Only cause I know that faggots respect pressure
Hardcore, like shit you get, kicked out the yard for
Kiss ain't the cops, but I lock niggas up
You could meet me in my cell, I soap and sock niggas up
Far as the flow go, you could let your dough show
Put your money on the table, we could battle on cable
Y'all hot dog niggas get nathans
Fuck around with Jason, that shorty from The Lox, John Blazin


My son cool out (what) don't beef yo, throw the tool out
Let's run these niggas, kidnap they work, make em move out
Crushed hash, hands is like glass, keep the heat
In the dash, did some dirt for some work, caught a gash
The flicker blocker, wicked sneaker rocker footwear
Strike me out God, stacking up joints, rack em like Footlocker
This is raw, raw like fuck kid, represent
Here to Crenshaw
Hold my words stronger than a Benz stall
Relentless, the anthology consolidated
With the quickness, dress up in the wig and blouse, killer sickness
Lex, imagination large, gold cards
Beat the bogus squad brains that connect put on the Older God
Specialist, iciclist, Woolrich collar
Feeling the rich, work for every dollar don't snitch, that's why
Broke niggas who got heart God, sign 'em up
Start the wind up, we John Blazin
Don up in the line up




It's simple mathematics, you gotta love us
Cause Joey Crack plus gat equals a lotta dead motherfuckers
Just when you thought I was done, I recruited Pun
Terror Squad Enterprise, undisputed Dunn
I'm from the slums where it's worse, bust with guns til it hurts
For fucking with my funds on the first
And go to church like a mobster
Discuss your death over shrimp and lobster
With my Cuban partners
Lucas with the cartridge, twenty shot
Run up on any block, disrespect any cop
Used to run many spots, now I own shops
Gortex with the lot, five sixty-four bills a pop
I'm hot, who wanna get burned
I fire one in your knot and watch your whole fuckin' head turn
You best learn to parley, I've had a hard day
Fuck around with the Don and get John Blazed





Verse 1:

Yo, we came long ways but we got on
Yo, holdin' my son's arm
Make it through the industry calm Lord
His name Rakim Allah
Wid a wavy threw on shallah
Braveheart nigga from start yo
We all scientific instruments
I got put on math
Going through ill consequences
Running from jakes, running in gates
Check out the main face
We gotta gas and erase
Me not the ambitious one
I rather be there throw a word or two in
We here, I know we worth money yo
Just relax start analyzing
'Fore you start adding your sales tax
Took that jewel in ooh 'bout to get large
Fuck that fucking wit C rules
Y'all fools, by then 2 rhymes is wrote
Trying to master my flow
Gettin' diamonds on the low
Splash me a boat

Hook: Kim Stephens

What I'm gonna be
Is something more than anyone could think of me
Do what you want I'm still gon' live my destiny
I've got one chance to live my life
And as long as I'm alive I will make it

Verse 2:

Hard work a label was sold yo
Just trying to take control rock me a Roll
Glock be the goal take my time and build
Into the 36 got real people wanna see us
The word Steeles, your work reflects your life
Your earth respects you twice
Commodity advice chill wid the ice
That's when I caught on
Sell these niggas the illusion
And plus live it out on spite
Yo the block is draining and scary
A nigga might die out here
Or be in some jail law library
Unlawful entry a century
Fuck I wanna live in jail?
I'm already in ghetto penitentiary
Talent made me be involuntary to y'all now
I just add on and teach one of y'all
Don't get exiled caught up in the mix
And loose sight focus first
And you're forced to go wild yo

Hook

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Aiyyo

Verse 3:

Aiyyo
Prosperity endangered so many of us
All the bullshit has got away with murder
That's why we can see who's real and who's fake
And who bit off the last nigga tape stole the steak
Wake up we running outta plans
The devil inside of him
Tricknology is in one hand
Future's so far to see
The present's how will it be
The past don't even ask just believe
Looking in the dictionary
Trying to spell out hard words
Define 'em and design 'em
I shine and curve
Take this jewel in and conquer me
I blend it in wit ganja
Not for the babies it's a mind sponsor
From the 17 million God raised
2 million lost slaved
19 million may we all praise
So when we wake up
Let's straighten up and get it together
For real and keep all getting paper

Hook

Do what you want I'm still gon' live my life



They're serving that exotic shit, man
Word up


Raekwon:
We drink Courvoisier exclusive
Kill off the snitches, fuck all fly bitches
Jump in the coupe, let your chicken yell
Throw her head out the moon, go ahead and look mama, see how it feels
I know the feds clustered up flexin', drivin', importin'
Insurance is killing the gangsta when you work four mils in office
Being the luck stud bad bitch in tux
She know me from the maxima era she bought the what
Automatic stainless good fella
That ain't my main bitch, who ride around angry, the same shit
Coast through the world like chess, niggas is blessed up
Yes yes, I'm at my best, boy rest
Powerful when giving coke out
You know they call me Sugar Ray The Chef, the gold child
Giving good-boy gifts to the gangstas
With more points than unicorns
They know his dough's o's out
Riding at maximum speed, give me weed give me cheese
I like cheddar of V-neck leather
Diana gold, two boxes centuries, yeah
Mention me, you better say that nigga is better, what?
Twilight up with the highlights, the wolf's out
Black fur, black spur, bitches is purred out
You know I'm flexing and my character strong
I could bag your bitch then flow through her lawn

JD Era:
I am killing them softly, pillow over the face flow
Them youngings let it off for them pesos
They used to cut off the hot water and cable
Now I'm standing with the garb out to bring amps to the table
What your life like? Mine's is real
We used to have to rob and steal
We cook, cook whatever for a bit of a meal
Yeah, they don't wanna see us win how I'm beginning to feel
But still I stand firm, posted up
They say knowledge is power, I soak it up
Kush pounds came here we broke it up
I said good morning to Toronto and woke it up
Wake up, bitch I'm here, it ain't a secret
My third eye twitching, the way I peeped it
A G's incense when the weed lit
And keep the white girls moving like the peach pit
That's some deep shit, I do it for my dawgs like I breed pits
Cream polo, matching clean kits
College rings got a nigga feeling like a genius
Paranoid of the lights when they flashing
Cash out big, money cashin, flow's everlasting
Swag like my passion is fashion
I'm on no lights, camera, action




Let's do it (blicka blao) hahaha yeah
(Blicka blao) somebody said they owe Tony a lil bit of bread
Tony, yeah (yeah), uh uh (let's go Lite, let's do it Ice Water style
C'mon, let's go)


Yo it's three individuals, three different attitudes
Fat Tony own it all, mafia gratitude
(Ain't nothing funny man, yo, it's Tony man
He sounds a little pissed off, I think he wants his money man)
Yo SI stand up, the event just started
Back to commence the prince, don't get me started
Take it back to '88 with the square top maxes
Underground money so the feds don't tax us
Hip-hop b-boys from the hood to the guedos
Slums in Texas, ya'll reckless, but ya'll still my peoples
Take money money, take money money money
You took a lil too much, now you can't do much
(Listen man, if Tony catch him, he gon put that fat to him)
If you got cash, homie, give that back to him
Everything will be good, and everything will be hood
And everything will go the way it should


It's just one of them days
Yeah everything was right in the hood
But in the night, we was up to no good
It's just one of them days
Hustlas, thieves and gamblas
The world love us, and ya'll can't stand us


From the days of guzzling Yak to playing Ms. Pac
Now it's on, automatic, ya'll will get sacked
I'm a stealer that'll pull out the smiff on you, cash a check
And now I'm on my way to flight, Pittsburg
These old niggas got a tab on me
A few of them want us dead, it's Fat Tony and his a calvary
Sneak past the two thousand dollars, we stashed it
There he go, it's Riviera, fat fucking cheap bastard
Now what we gon do is breeze
I kept the weight, smelling the trees
Now we up in OCBs
Should we get our money back? Please
I'd rather give turkey and cheese
Tell his little fat ass freeze




I remember back in '88, cat's pushing crazy weight
In my pops Cadillac with the baby face
Now I'm where the cops at, trying to make that cake
With a two finger ring and a name plate
We all in the same race, life's a struggle
I love getting bread, but I don't even like the hustle
If we fight, I'm more then like to cut you
Cuz back in the day, there was no guns, we had to fight with knuckles
Hangin out where the thugs at
We was goin to school, leather garments with the gloves to match
The game ain't changed, brothas still bubbling crack
And the plan was hand to hand, just to double it back
And you gotta have something to stack
Cuz these New York streets nowadays ain't nothin but rats
Dice games, nice change, get one in your hat
They called for your bread, and you ain't gettin none of it back






Nothing but big gooses in here, kid...


Rock your ship, black, million dollar man march rap
Physically strapped, electrifying gats, flying at
Rap herbals with verbals, kingpin's swerve out
Styles 360 degrees, don't blur out
Pass the word out, we don't bring dirt out
Yo, swerving out, mass murder route, blaow
Get up and work now, ya'll niggas feel jerk now
Take your money back, fuck yours, I'm lookin' truck, still broke down
Pass the smoke out, fly steaming hat, choked down
Hailing from the throat down, six hundred dollar coke, baow!
Last quote now, the don, Lexy float now
Hope now, Atlanta big boat style, we float now
Twist the flow Nile, the bitch tore down
Get it right, the wrist roll down, fly sneaker nigga, low down
Go down, lady dry ya blower out, casarole role, roll out
The jack star, track, fold out
Bone out, pound and a half'll blown out
Half the bone out, halfway home, it's on now


Aiyo, cats be telling on kids, now that's a lie, son
Cats be telling on kids, do or die, son
Cats that run with you, dumb out, puff blunts with you
Cats be telling on kids, now that ain't love son
Cats be feeling you, then what, be grilling you
Cats be fronting on kids, Lex, you live, son


Learn how to bust these, gemmed out, yo Killa lust these
Try not to trust these, I'm six Guyanese, dust these
Set up to fuck these, good luck, trees rolling out with rugbies
You love these, certified thugs, blowing up g's
We all that, commissioner don rap, with the arm at
Set up saloons, bring pawns where we want at
Reward that, Oscar Award, applaud that
We like Hardcastle and McCormack, set up the floor mat
Splash four hat, Similac cats, tour rap
Faggot-ville, where other reals won't ball at
React tours that, Hillfinger drawers, Wu hat
Relax do that, whoever boo trash, two at
Beige or blue hat, suede wally shoe, lashin' Clue at
White folks, come out your night clothes, sliding through that






Kidz from the Hood is more dangerous
Everybody vest up, all the shot callers with aim, stick
From three pound, automatic is nasty, raspberry color
My shit bloody, with mud on my New Balance
Goodness gracious, more lazers, watch my family
Had these niggas, these niggas got more Rae shit
Three sixty weight, put somethin' in the air
He didn't die, but he coped the hearing aid, son
New shit, New Balance click, true blue sixes burst
The nurses in the joint, who school ninja's
The next paragraph might excite you, enlighten you
To get up, get hype a little, bust rifles through him
I wrote it like that, to rock wigs, ox' kids
Boxes, cops is chasin' niggas to cribs
Vision the next verse is classy, ask me
How these young niggas get money, the tongue speaks so raspy, yo


I'm here to teach these niggas how to, handle the pot, like
Scramble the rock, dog, I'm hurtin' the block, like
Dirty signed with The Roc, word to my pops
Front on my team and that thang-a-rang, my gang'll bang
My life is like a horror movie, so ya'll can hardly move me
Come through your block on a Harley, sprayin' a uzi
Got killas on a payroll, killas on the lay low
Niggas that'll kill when I say so
Turn rappers to Ma$e, four/fifth tear up half of your face
Chef, move, I got him, he laced, broad day
Jump out the whip, pop your bitch, all we do, is powerful tips


Time waits for no man, the clock is tickin'
Still bubble crack, watch the little man from the kitchen
Guns in the closet, packs in the Ac' for pitching
Haters can't stop a prophet, march and start snitchin'
Rims spinnin', Loose Linx came expensive
No cars we movin' in, lease to rent it
Dangerous ground, guerilla nigga shakin' it down
Escape from N.Y., we paintin' the town
Actual fact, Carlton Fisk, the fugitive's back
Breakin' bread with made men, so look for the silence of mayhem


Yo, I was down, I was up, now it's back to me, back down
These cutthroat niggas, had made me step up my cracks now
They ran with my secrets, I would tell them, they watch it
And they peep it, a lot of them niggas came from under me, and
Those be the ones most defective
To build a sick strategy on rapping method, give 'em E for effort
Gotta send 'em a message, without talkin' that shit could get hectic
Money first, and friendship is second
Superior's La, inferior's ya'll
Don't make me worry it, ya'll, cut friendship ain't necessary at all
Get down or lay down, I'm suggestin' a call
I got drugs and I'm gettin' them all
I still got a lot of problems on my chest, and I'm gettin' 'em off
I suppose that ya'll know that though
So when I get paid, escape a payback, like I owed that dough




God rules everything around us
Goons get the money, Killa Killa Hill ya'll


Yo, we grew up in the grind, ya'll
Now it's our time to shine ya'll, yo, we did our time ya'll
Now we back to collect our check, give us our respect
Debts gotta get paid off, a nigga hit the deck
My Goon Squad coming correct, handcuffs, Jakes backin' us up
We got it rough, on some guns bust
Niggas hold dust, through it all, kept our head off
Feds sped up, niggas in my hood read up
We still gully, and my whole click dead up
Clackin' them shots, right, my Goon Squad kick lead up




I'm from the Valley where the Goons stay, valors and S.K.'s
Shoot up your saloon and lay
Through a poverty side of my life, we came from
All the big niggas eat meals, real niggas kept ones
So much drugs in a box, gloves, couple Glocks
Thugs that stay on blocks, wolves that lay on cops
Dressin' like gangstas, I've been silkin' it before courvoisier and blunts with rocks
We had to eat to live, cuz only real niggas protect
Lively hood, and get Hollywood props
I ran with arm specialist who loved to shoot, wrestle, spit
Bang bitches, buy a little drizzle and box
For all that we know, I analyze the rich steelo
Milk the game, Suge Knight a few people
Then made a lot of deposits, throughout the logic
My mental came swift, that's the project




Aiyo, my team pressed up on the crime side
Them devils tried to catch us all, guarding our blind side
I cocked back the hammer, load up on my nine side
Startin' a revolution, like my Goon Squad died, poverty strucken
Right where the poor people reside, deep in the hood
Young bloods stay flippin' them pies, lookin' for easy ways out
My niggas try'nna survive, whippin' the gauge out
Strugglin', against all odds, stompin' the rage out
Duckin' down deep in them cars, whippin' the page out
Niggas stay kickin' them bars, knockin' ya fade out
Get ready for my Goon Squad stars, let the parade out






(Yo, Oh, Yo Rae... I can't feel my face
My heart pounding and shit (audible heart)
Paranoid as a motherfucker right now, who the fuck?
Close them blinds and shit! Who that? Captain Kirk?
This the fucking Stark...enterprise, enterprise outside and some shit?
I need some pussy though I'm ready to fuck Catwoman or something
F-fuck it, lets go!

Aiyyo shareefa go to the store for me. I need some razors and a fresh box
Of baggies, the ones with the tint in them!
Aiyyo son turn that water down a little bit, just a little bit..Thank You
I need two waters, a dutch, and a cranberry Snapple)


All around the world today, the Kilo is the measure
(Whoever got the kilos got the candy, man!)
A kilo is one thousand grams, its easy to remember
(You never catch the kid going hand to hand!)
All around the world today, the Kilo is the measure
(Once you got the funds you got the panties, man!)
A Kilo is a thousand grams, its easy to remember
(Throughout I-95 I'm the Handyman)


Bricks, Tar caps, powder, cooked up crack
Phones is tapped over franklin's stacks
Kingpins put in bullpens, old connects get paro'
Break out of town when the Jakes take down the Pharoah
Reason, He was moving that peruvian white
Blowing coolies in the hoopties , slamming cuties at night
Big heavy pots over hot stoves
Mayonnaise jars of water with rocks in them got my whole projects out of order
A Kilo is a thousand grams
Beige, gold, brown, dirty, fluffy, tan, extract oil cut from cuban plants
The chemist is brolic, pyrex scholars
Professors at war over raw, killing partners for a million dollars




Yeah
Aiyyo peace to those cooking that raw, powder white
Get your sniff on, scarface niggas, we getting right
Some call it bricks, some call it birds
How many niggas get they lives tooken playing with shit, then catch a curve
You would go to jail
Get caught with this, niggas'll grow to fail
Stop playing, pot slaying, baking soda and scales
They lived like brothers, word life, connects discovered
Most niggas get hard, from fucking with them pipes and hustlers
Kilo is one thousand grams
You know your ammo better be heavy cause soon kids is coming in camo
Protect your land daddy, I'm an announcer
You get caught with an ounce and its over
Matter 'fact they takin you down, son




Some say a drug dealers destiny is reachin the ki'
I'd rather be the man behind the door, supplying the streets
A hundred birds go out, looking like textbooks
When they wrapped and stuffed
Four days later straight cash, two million bucks
Strictly powder, no cut
Your coke is vialed in, whats up?
Y'all beefin over little shit, we sniff, the balance split up
In a plane or a penthouse, office or a warehouse
Tony's got it nice, we never heard of any big droughts
Kilo is a thousand grams
A pile of sand is equivilant, to the eye
It's nice to have a thousand fans
Coke buyers, some be liars
Therefore, you check for wires
Dedicated dealers, during holidays we give 'em lighters


Red tops, blue tops, green tops, yellow tops
Purple tops, beige tops, white tops, grey tops
Black tops, clear tops, gold tops, pink tops
Silver tops, tan tops, aqua tops, orange tops
Salt tops, long tops, short tops, 12 12's
58 58's, weed bags, ziplocks
Big rocks, coke spots, two Glocks, one ox
Crumbs chopped, hot pots, one plate, crack Spot

Racing through the hood, ski mask off
Criminology hustle, when goons play the heat, blast off
And every direction, protect ya babies, your moms
Late night like Carson Daly, Theo Bailey, we stay armed
Grits box, vacuum tight, concealing the powder
Five fake cans of blow to throw them off wit the flower
Red dots on me, big scopes, bullets the size of nickels
Got Starkey coming out of his coat
I gots to jet, don't look back, my cardio's killing me
Old ladies is like 'Hold ya head, Tone, literally'
All this, for a thousand grams?
I'd rather be a con artist scheaming with a thousand scams

Thirteen getting it, pyrex whipping it
Like UPS, pack it up, shipping it
Whether base or sniffing it, I got your fix
The story's foretold like apocalypse
It was me Michael T.T., handing out freebies
Taking over blocks, telling niggas to be fee
Where big brother 'Vine'll leave the body in the street
Something kinda like how I be bodying the beat
We was 300 deep like the Persian soldiers
Word spread fast, we was serving boulders
Ten crack commandments, holy Moses
If you don't fit must equip icer toners
Never grip they holders, fingers to the snitchers
The New York niggas be taking all our bitches
But we be God damned if taking all our business
Duct tape, hard tops, C.S.I. forensics






Let's go (Yeah, nigga)
Good lookin' Rae that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
(It's all good don't worry about it)
You feel what I'm sayin'? (Don't worry about it)
Yeah (Word up, let's go)
You know how we gotta come at this niggas, man
Yeah.. come on.. yo


Stuck, y'all like gum underneath my kicks
Better move little fucks when the heat I'll spit
The hammer clap like the ass on a meat-out chick
Dump clips like a trifflin' ass bitch to drop
If you short you're a chance in the box
But I ain't lettin' you play with the guns in the club, I'm boothin' the ox
Got my eyes on the ho's and I'm a peripheral
Got you cowards poppin' that Moe', my hand on the 'istol
Wild out, have a ball, you could drink 'til you 'url
Thought the Firewater was strong, the pound'll leave you curled
On the floor, like a new born baby, God
What you mean "Is he dead?", what type of shit is leakin' out of his head?
When you cowards see the drama and it come to a head
I'm hittin' Rae up on the jacket, it ain't much to be said
If it's on, go without sayin' somethin', deliverin'
Visa verca, this is Havoc, baby, we those niggas (we those niggas)


All that money is us, now what's fuckin' wit' us?
Eh yo all around hungry, that's us and can't get nothin' get it
Eh yo all that money, all them niggas
All them shorties, everybody yell "All lovely"


I chop meat out ya face, Daddy, gladly
Mad breeze on, rubberband currency and I splash ya visa
You know the code, yo caesar low straddlers
Front Streets, cracks all in the front seat spazzin'
Imperial wizards, Staten
Knife game off the chain and I'm with four hundred with wagons yo
Live wires, shoot darts for bread
Any map, I assist that, I'm holdin' it, all niggas dead
What? Battle for cake and fuck wizzes
We do it straight business, all mount ride, ain't no fake niggas
Reminisce, spit faces
Pissin' on the fake little swindler's list, Rae gave them niggas cake
Battle the gun, you're wildin'
I might levitatate well, I might take ya shit, push up, stylin' it
Oxes, reefers, police need us
The regime of Shaolin with Queens re-up
Fuckin' with the poisonous hand
Remember y'all, no commercial, I hurt you, yo go get ya mans




Eh yo select me, Gucci sneaker recipe
Not the S dot Carters, no disrespect but respect me
One of the top five gangstas alive
My element is just the Elliott Ness, niggas who hide
Yo I ran from some niggas that was police
These niggas heard about me bringin' marked money in, I had the whole East
I've been the greatest, been flippin' the latest
Somethin' like the new haggler on the Ave., ham it up, pullin' haze
And all the young niggas praise me
It's like the talent of the Six Million Dollar Man, 'yana pace
Come on, banana squeeze, aim at these Caravans
Heard he had his man and that ugly Keish'
Comin' from a galaxy of hood, hard real people gettin' ki's
Fuck wit' the media, it's all good





F/ Havoc

Pushing for the King of New York, I see it
Gangsters try so hard but can't be it
Only one could rise above all the rest
And I got faith in my man, Lest
Take down the King's throne
Conquer the warzone


Lester Kane, I call him LK for short
See LK pushing for that King of New York
Few million dollar cribs
Liberace jewel box, gold ox
Ostrich leather shoes, the egyptian socks
Tailor made shoes built like a brick house
Six foot nine, son
The God had to duck in his house
Keep a trail of bitches,I'm talking three on each side
The head of his syndicate
Walk with black pride
He a monsoon mastermind
Flyer than the Isleys
Put a pop in your pudding
But not the Cosby's type
I'm talking big guns and Cadillac coupes
The New York monsignor's just scared of his suits
And his troops is like loyal lions, ready to feast
At the first drop of blood that falls down from the beast
Roam these streets with iced out case for the syndicate
Fucking with Lester on these blocks, boy, you in for it


Pushing for the King of New York, I see it
Gangsters try so hard but can't be it
Only one could rise above all the rest
And I got faith in my man, Lest
Take down the King's throne
Conquer the warzone


All hail to the King Kane
Sling remarkable razor lines
Organized crime brung shotty's under the trenchcoat
Black Bugatti with gold spokes, folks get heart attacks
Sitting on top of the glow. money in garbage bags
Washing up the restaurants, nightclubs, etc
Pinky ring worth a small island, I raise the bezel up
Women on they're night strolls turning tricks and they trained to go
Nothin' stoppin' my function, got coppers on the payroll
Lawyers and judges quick to toss cases when I say so
King of New York with pesos
Leaving 'em foaming, mouths stitched
Eyes wide shut but speaking on my firm
When will they learn, loose lips will get your flesh burned
Puffing on a Cohiba Cuban
Them rubies got some bullets with they're name on it
And I'm itching to send it through
City is mine with war on my mind
And take the thrown by design
Yes, it's mine, I claim the spot cause I'm


Pushing for the King of New York, I see it
Gangsters try so hard but can't be it
Only one could rise above all the rest
And I got faith in my man, Lest
Take down the King's throne
Conquer the warzone


Temper like a old dad who lost his kids
Lester'd be the first to spaz out and slap you with
Headlocked the bitch, spit in the mouth while she screaming
Tie her to the cross in the church and write "Demon" in blood
On her titties, no remorse for life
He wild for the night, son, gun and knife
Living trife reckless, hang a man by his necklace
Then mail it to his family with blood still on it
Few black roses, maybe a finger or two
He out to be the King of New York
And he gon' do exactly what he put his mind to
He a crimeboy, he's diligent
Silverback gorilla and he's killing it
Ruthless, this man reminds me of myself
Tony Starks, the King obsessed with wealth and power
Built for the takeover
Rearrange your whole damn face
You need a makeover


Pushing for the King of New York, I see it
Gangsters try so hard but can't be it
Only one could rise above all the rust
And I got faith in my man, Lest
Take down the King's throne
Conquer the warzone




Being's that it's gettin' ready to go
Yo, you know that sound? Yeah, some bad from here
Yeah, this real right here, I'm back, boy

Watch my voice man
Different from other cat's voices, man, remember that, man
Different flows, man

You been away for a minute, heard your style got flyer
Yo, hold on, the sword got heavy, Universal caught on
Now its time to take over the melody
Plus stand firm, Staten Island kingpins
Ink pens go to work, and I got ninjas who speak French
My flow, God, build for sevens and fives, straight up big shits
Sprewell wheels, kids with bee hives, I'm old school
Got a old tool, plus rollin' with the old crew
Richer than The Jackson 5
I kill for money, rap ain't nothing
I'm a real estate slave, chump, and I got some money in Vibe
Read the news, now, Chef coming for you, reviews gon' start poppin' up
You, crews start lockin' up
Yeah, think that I'm playin', I got
Two red assault rifles, ready for your wig, I'm sprayin' shit


Uh, uh, exclusive boy
Let's do it to them, aiyo


Aiyo, flashin' in a robe from England
Heavyweight slap gannon king, and I do the raft thing, blaze niggas
Forty acres of land, eleven guns, Moore soft leathers
Why we keep rappin' in the slums?
Hibernate with big hammers, elephants hands
The Fila shits, support Ralley's, robbin' in Sam's
Tell the media we generation money
Both hands is clusty, but I rather be in Russia spendin' trust money
Feel the sleeves? Thats ostrich
Mutiple v's, my own company, with forty eight mobsters, yo
Rob niggas on the hurry, get busy, pull out them tranquilizer guns
Bye sleepy head, get jiggy
For all the regulator soldier, I demonstrate the lifestyle
Of gettin' knifed down, I might pop you over
Come up, try soldier
Civilize your whole life, fast, ya'll ain't fly, rover
Don't test me, pa, you're playin' with death
What you think they call the kid Chef for, I poison up vets


And I told you baby, it's goin' down
Word up, you know how we give it to 'em
Word up, what's the deal, though, nigga
Word up, one, aiyo


Aiyo, I said it, I meant it, I lived it
The legend rep, for all real niggas, on the set, don't ever go against him
Live for the action, a warrior
Wu taught me that, though
Now I go for self, Van Glorium
I've been carryin' on cats, I'm like Hitler on diesel
Execute them Purple Tape thieves, yo
Ya'll niggas ain't nothin', I've been on
I told ya'll what I wanna do
Watch me get the glow, when I get on




From here on nothing goes down unless I'm involved
No black jack, no dope deals, no nothing
A nickel bag gets sold in the park
I want in


Oh man
Stop playing with that man
Stop playing with that son for real
Haha man this nigga put the clip in
Yo you stupid man
Stop playing with that for real son
Stop playing with that man
This nigga got
This nigga putting the fucking clip in and shit
Popping it in there on some (?) shit
Fuck is you doing son?




Suga, come here, ayo man, tell ya man
He better bring that fucking money here tomorrow, man
You, walk up in the joint with me, man
It's all real, yo, what up son?
Yo, hold the bottle, it's your night, nigga!
It's your night!
Yeah, mad bottles! Playboy! We out of here, man
(Step inside, kiss the ring --- so salute, and toast to the best who done it)
{Give it up for the Wu-Tang Clan!}


When I step inside, kiss the ring, Wu Familia
La Cosa Nostra, it's our thing
So salute, and toast to the best who done it
Murder rap shit, I spit, for the vets who love it


By the time you read this letter
Your head gon' fly off your shoulder for lying
And I'mma be in bed like holders
Blood from a horse on your spread, you tried to play me now
I'm coughing up, dough on your head, you just a baby
See me in the flick in Zurich, I had to maybe with me
All these niggas stay in the 90's, getting rich
Rick Ruler robe on with rings, walking to the throne
Fronting like I know I'm the king, I live alone though
Buying up, China's Beemers, taking it to Simon's in Medina
Only just to blind you and leave ya
These young boys is crafted with aim, I bought 'em all
Fly ranches, cuz they all stand beside me with flames
Regardless, yo, to making the classic
You gon' witness some of the tactics
Some died, live in the action
A live general when he walk, if he died, then we slide
Ninety thou' in the coffin, and take the child


When I step inside, kiss the ring, Wu Familia
La Cosa Nostra, it's our thing
So salute, and toast to the best who done it
Murder rap shit, I spit, for the vets who love it


Black Jesus, check my walk, check my talk
Legend in the flesh and I rep New York
Crowned king, been down to bang, I'm House Gang
Knockout specialist, in and out the ring
Got dinner tables long as boats with old kitchens
And Wu-Tang logos splashed on all the dishes
You know how I speaks the truth, how I teach the youth
I'm an animal, I beast the booth
Been grinding, banging out for food to eat
Your boy still eating good, check my new physique
Since the world is mine, I'mma write my name on the clouds
So that ol' yee faithful, can praise it and bow


Now he's an old Mafia don, from back when
He managed to survive the game, ducking fame
It's how he maintained, the State of Grace, kept his lab laced
Ladies of a fine taste, kept his place guarded
While the young charted, found acquitted, all charges
And his heart loss and, marksmen take the contract
From the contact, waiting for the right event, it all made sense
He left no prints on the weapon, and he was blasting
Came home from prison stashing, still stacking
His whip still matching his kit, steel flashing
Hands quick, nice with his shit, three holy foods drops jewels
From a street corner level, young brother, I'mma rebel
Here to instruct private soldiers to buck arms
Ya'll rap cats had your last win, toast the kings
It's Wu-Tang, it's our thing, kiss the ring


When I step inside, kiss the ring, Wu Familia
La Cosa Nostra, it's our thing
So salute, and toast to the best who done it
Murder rap shit, I spit, for the vets who love it

Fake niggas throw shit in they drinks
Club nights we snatch linx, politic, Africans, and Chinks
While World of Sport niggas snort coke by the seconds
Niggas projects filled with fiends injecting Morphine
The God seen more cream, and upstate
Cousin Reek, almost got hit with fourteen
Chill pa, the God'll be a Star when you come home
Light bones, and let you rock my 3G stone
So, see cousin, yo I was working, cats I'm jerking
And uptown these niggas acting like they hurting
Keys 24 a brick
Columbians be on some bullshit, that's why Papi got hit
Stay tuned, word up, I hope to see you in June
By the way, I seen your bitch, she was up in this cat's room
Skied up, weed the fuck up, to top it off
Look beat up, with two crack fiends hugging your seed up
I took care of that, though, but don't worry 'bout it
I got your back though


Yo, why's my niggas always yelling that broke shit?
Let's get money son, now you wanna smoke shit
Chill God, yo, the son don't chill Allah
What's today's mathematics, son? Knowledge God


Fly like cashmere, last year, my team caught bodies in Grasmere
Hit a store owner named Mike Lavogna
Italiano, slanted-eyed, banging a fat Milano
Selling coke right out the bottle
Sometime, a nigga brought 9's, to test with mines
Crazy piece, buying keys in grease
Was a rich nigga, picture the nigga without dope figures
Condo with his chick, rocking the gold vigor
Mafia flicks, tying up tricks was his main hobby
Teaching his seed, Wu-Tang karate
Mixing drinks in clubs, hairy chest with many minks
Night time rolling with snakes
Extra live, he claimed he couldn't die, top rank
Sixteen shots in his fish tank
And his pet piranha, he named him Marijuana
Smokin ganja, calling his weed pipe Sandra
Claiming New York was ancient Babylon
Where the sky stayed the color of grey, like her-on
I can't front though, truck loads of indo
Soon to blow slow, his ass is out now, tally-ho


Yo, why's my niggas always yelling that broke shit?
Let's get money son, now you wanna smoke shit
Chill God, yo, the son don't chill Allah
What's today's mathematics, son? Knowledge God
Yo, why's my niggas always yelling that broke shit?
Let's get money son, now you wanna smoke shit
Chill God, yo, the son don't chill Allah
What's today's mathematics, son? Knowledge God

Yo, why's my niggas always yelling that broke shit?
Let's get money son, now you wanna smoke shit
Chill God, yo, the son don't chill Allah
What's today's mathematics, son? Knowledge God

Lay on the crime scene, sipping fine wines, pulling nines on
UFOs taking they fly clothes, they eyes closed
We getting loot, no doubt, check the word of mouth
Unheard about, guns go off, and now I murder route
I'm out, my raps play the part, like a Get Smart secret agent
In a maze and style's blazing
Johnny Blaze and Tony Starks in a daze and
And Rhyming, my nigga Lou Diamond with Robert F
We like Meth to go and fuck with Noodles
Having them poodles on the lockdown, buying me
Amarettos and chewables, smacking pharmecuetical
Rap niggas on dust and woos
Yo, I told you, some killed, robbed and fold
The goal's untold, fuck it, it beats parole
So stroll marvelous, soul controller of the whole globe
Goddamn I got it sewn and yo
What up wop? Pop the suitcase high and we can talk
You can walk out the fucking building and get caught
Save the fully inflatable, rap relatable
Drug relatable, niggas here to play with you
A hundred dollar Rottweiler, go to spot sellers
Guns and Glocks for them niggas who got props
Off top jail niggas get mad bigger and yo
Mail a guy about a hundred pictures
Word to mama, this rap wonder rhymer team got drama
Comma, blunt smoke real ass marijuana
Chef Maranzano boats across the Verrazano
Immaculate, bust off my gun's so accurate
And get cream in the cuisine of Queens
I told you Money skated with night beams and two rings


Crazy fag, I'm getting ready to do this shit
(Sniff mad shit)
Man, niggas know not to step on this shit


Who's the knucklehead, wanting respect?
Chop his fingers in the drug game, Money well known
Lead singer, humdinger, flash is the aftermath, here's his photograph
Run up in his lab, take off the mask Chas and think fast
Don't laugh, bag the cash, grab the hash, don't forget his stash
Grab the tear gas and place it in his face fast
At full blast {*Car zooming by*}
Then skate to the next gate further upstate
I heard they got crazy weight, bagged up by the cakes in
Crates like disco breaks, yo look out for Jakes
Give it all it takes, let's burn the place before we motivate
Yo, Blake, niggas don't fake, rape his mate
If the bitch scream, for God's sake grab the grey tape
It's by the plate with the blow crushed up with the flakes
Killer snakes, four bodies found floating in lakes
Drug related paper talking about the kids who didn't make it
Hits without a trace, never seen the bricks, see Rae and Ghostface
Congratulations Chef, let's celebrate and sniff an eighth

{*Inaudible conversation*}


The rap star is born
Rap Parmesan, put it on, seal it on
We're silicone, spark it on your talkathon
This rap phenomenon, two corresponds
Took the arms, hit me on the hip and horns, rap chaperone
Scars tone, bars thrown, war tones, raw tones
Blowing out the door, bones, but
Your raps is fraudulent, plug in these rap coordinates
Is reinforced with suspense, be on your rap sword defense
These microphone professional, sensational
Fully operational, I got niggas here to play with you
You know the steez, you know my whole program
Brothers from the no-lands, all we want is the Gs, guns and grams
Living fat like the Hoffa, mafia, sipping, eating pastas
Laying in the house telling the seeds about the sagas
Before we got dramatic and thoughts got sporadic
We grabbed golden tablets and quick guarded the Abbots
Slugs hit the Pelle, put tokes into the belly
Suckers tried to knock me out the box like Skelly
I smoke the weed trees, I drop top to the breeze
Honey dip spending G's on nails and hair weave
The crime boss, taking no loss, excessive force
We can play the A-Train back of the iron horse


Raekwon: Yo, man, you know what I'm saying?
Ghostface: Fuck it man

{*Tire screech*}
{*crash*}




We slang kilos, eighths to them shorties, bring G loads
A paper to the hood, we got you, cop three of those
And get your hustle right, whether you a trapper
Or a gun clapper, make sure your weapon is hype
We got all kinds of shooters, sprayers, pitchers
Nigga who hit playa, catch you in ya gators
Haters that love rockin nigga for bread, lead fly
Hit in you back of your head, he gettin dough, all that's dead now
Yo, no more hallucinatin, we just used to hatin
Go 'head and violate, we murder clicks, who you takin?
Not none of us! You know my gun'll bust
And every town state, niggas pull they guns for us
And peel somethin up, and kill somethin up
We "Go Hard" like Tennessee boys, hit 'em up
We get it every day and, it's like a matinee and
We on the block hard, Allah said "Rae, you made it"
It's time to take it over, it ain't a safe promoter
Out there, give me my change or get thrown in the Rover


It's Donnie, I get lots of bread, though as far as that block
I got it locked, like a rasta's dreads
And I will infra-beem dot ya head, put a couple of shots
Inside your top, tryna stop my spread
Fuck cops, I just watch for feds
Cause I know they be hatin on how I'm cakin
Want me boxed or dead
I move with birds by the flock, instead - D.C
I keep whoopin, keep cookin, 'til the pots is red
Keep pushin, I don't stop at reds, fuck a red light
It's red light specials, when I pop that lead
I can even make a boxer beg, catch ya pops in bed
Pop his legs, while you watch him beg
The name's Donnie, I was mobster bred, so you know I'm a don
Plus I was born with that shottas edge
I keep that chopper filled with copperheads, I bust a couple of shots
It'll leave a couple coppers dead
And you can run a couple blocks ahead, and won't get away
Unless you wore some shit today that blocks ya head

...


Huh, step up yo' game, you off the square (square)
You can't be a pimp just cause you got long hair (hair)
'Lacs don't make macks, AK's don't make killas
Scary niggas shoot first, if you a G, it's a curse (curse)
+Last of a Dying Breed+ like Brad JORDAN
Pimp C, bitch! Words nuts and my foreign
If I say it in the streets, I'll say it to ya face
Knock ya whole muthafucka off, take my case
Never give up my connects, never hit P.C
I'm a young fuckin HOG! Bitch, +The Game Belong to Me+
Dick ain't free, fuck a promo show
You ain't got fifty thousand cash, bitch, fuck the radio! (beyatch!)
Fuck BET and fuck, Diana Ross

J. Prince the Godfather, DJ Screw is the King
Bought my dick, a Cadillac, got'cho advance in my pinky rang, BEEEEE-YATCH!!!

Motherfucker, smoke sum'hin, BEE-YATCH!!

Ich war der Don doch lebte jahrelang in Tarnung
Der Kopf des Kartells wie Bernado Provenzano
Der Weedbaron der gern Grastten kifft
Ich hab mehr Beutel Dope als El Chapo vertickt
Ich wurd vom Capo zum Boss und machte Geld auf der Street
Ich stieg immer weiter auf in der Kartellhirachie
Im Drogenkrieg siehst du blutige Kadaver im Dreck
Nenn mich Frank Costello Bitch weil der Pate is back
Sie nehmen mich fest und fahren mich mit einer Streife zum Gericht
Fick die Cops sie haben keinerlei Beweise gegen mich
Ich hab Dealer gefoltert wenn meine Kohle nicht da war
Und schiee mit Kugeln bis ich Tod bin wie Tony Montana
Ich bernehmen die Stadt und verticke die Buds
Die meisten meiner Homies sitzen im Hochsicherheitstrakt
Bin euch vorraus und berwache jeden Schritt den ihr macht
Lieber kill ich mich selbst bevor ihr Ficker mich schnappt


Back the .. blocked up drinking some rucked up
Calling what you call it i'ma call it some block stuff
Use to flash in dex double barrel to flips narrow don't
Even give it to doubt it
Hang with the monster monsters all them keep
Rocks in innocence with the arguments drugs and guns
And guns and every part of my plan is done
Half am i mention one yeah i'ma ..
Full over the .. my nigga is this
The bigger we get the bigger we fall the bigger we shake
Shake the wall for the ..bank robbers ain't gonna ..
My nigga is quit to get off...
Is just a family steady don't' get spread up fucking with the family carry


Playing da block like the rubber
On da wheels Of a dirt bike
Life rolling close To da streets
I roam da earth like Anyone can get it
My morals, rooted in G code
Everybody's wit it, Das wit me
Das all my Gs know
Bootcamps clickin we Thick in this game heavy
My Wu connect Stickin Ta Poppin, This games levy
Dis young Veteran, Notable con letterman
Trigga con mikeHe get right On da knock
Let Em in, I'm like Picasso
Recreating my landscapes and given it ta god
Beyond da beauty, dat man makes Altering phasods
No saving face When Ya man quakes Dis Handz luc Picard

We give it up, let's go




Yo, what up, what's good?
Yeah, nigga, hold this money right here, yeah
We already got them mapped out, you know
Alright, don't even stress it
Niggas got mad coke inside the Luvs pampy
Luvs Pampers box, nigga
Them niggas is stupid


That nigga pussy doing pig latin, he can't come to the hood
Might kill him off top up in the Staten
Son think he better than niggas, I think his rebels is resentful
Tried to kill him in his rental
He had an Idi Amin approach, hitting the roach
Had a hunger face, he drove his moms Seven in the ocean
It's a wild cowboy sling heroin, who rock the dead arm
Knocked the DEA agent out his Cheron
All his Eli's, macheted up, stainless --
You never heard nothing, all you hear is the guns blaze
Rocking pastel blazers, with a shorty from Iceland
Who old dad put him up on rice and
Starving to make a wack debut, he came through the lobby
Three coacher Devilles with him, a whitey, it's pathetic
Ragged monkey face, faggot dead it
Coming through the stairs with blow in his mouth, desperate
Watching him looking stupid, son know we on foot patrol
Come through the hole, niggas is spooking
Seven hundred shots, all leather gloves, six thugs
Two had a mask on, he took 'em off what
We got you now, nigga, blowing you down, niggas is foul
This is trauma king, by any means, blaow
They pushed his face in, fell out his Saucony's, snatched his homeys
Took his Glock, you gon' be my tenderoni?


Uhh, metal exchange, is the hood, the gun range
Everybody's a target depending on how you aim
Dice games and ice chains, pendant spelling your names
OG's setting the wrong example, telling the same
Look at Shorty Shitstain, grew up to be a fucking mess
Before his click came, he banged and never tuck his chest
Closet full of them things, he caught the gun connect
Riding around with A and Lil' Nino and they want respect
Son call, Nino want the show, everybody know they straight
Shipping hood bitches to the bungalow
Pillow talking let the birds hawk it
Chatting bout what happen, and when and would it coming back in
Champagne's lacking trafficking while they travel
Word got back to old time friends and snakes rattle
Two different burners, but the one that dropped the birds got tail
Information for the ones that like to steal, got mail
Pussy power made the plans sour
Apartment full of party powder, outside a stakeout for hours
Click batch from big gats and rags
Soon as the door squeaks, they running up on the grass
Bang flash, shots ride on path of broken glass
Comedy laughs, while they haul ass with the bags
Legends in my hood play bat, twin benzes whipping in black
Connect was like the old Maybach




Parked the Red Baron Beamer in the back of the cleaners
Relaxing with an army gun Zima
Medellin is in my blow like Floyd dance
This chain I wear is skinny, baby, but the weight 80 gram
Jumping out of silent shit, rugby marathon
Peace to Rob Paragon, smoke with Aguillah
Blow is designed for the ghost
But I don't want it if it's biting the head off
Come see me slap a don
Great escape, me and that connect with the crimeys
Back when me and Flex kidnapped the 90's
I was king, call me Luther LeBron
Make a dream team appear
Court-side seats in the karmas
Known for my get-down and fly wears
Usually my eyewear that make me buy up everything bomb
I'm a old Fila king with wings on
Street sharp Nike suit
Sharpey goon-face Milan


We getting bread in the building
Niggas getting money
Quick to spread in the building
Get lead in the building
Bosses don't bite, they write checks
I want the nigga head in the building
Get fed in the wilderness


Ay yo, four-limb goose down to the Timbs
The gems is coke-boy money, lay in the 700 Benz
Blowing cheeba, dumping ashes
The class of last year
That'll throw your head through the glass
Forty-five, all diamonds in it
Grimies did it
Chinese killers jump out and divot
I will post in the New York Post, blueberry ghost
You'll steady motion when I'm aiming my pitch
We young niggas who die hard
Fly ride hard
Soft top, that means to push your head off
I be famous, but my bodyguard Spanglish
It's all miscellaneous, ain't nobody telling
It ain't a issue
Thick skits tapes with bombs in it
Cooler than the velvet-grown pool
And the pussy embalmed with it
Yeah, Buddha texture's cashmere
I beat your man up, drop five hundred, and blow and smash gears






Here's the deal, 300 mil, we in the field
With the boots on, police on us for real
And I love it, my guns is rugged, bulletproof vans with plans
To stay gangstered up and scramble
With the rest of the stresses, the tests
My bank HSBC, yeah, feel all my blessings
While wild out, I'm mild out, calm and humble
Blow a hole in your soldier, come through
Beyond that, guns for combat, right in front of the lobby
My hobby just too ill to saw black
He ain't the shit, we ain't the shit
But we will squeeze for them keys, point black and spank ya shit
Always in Nike, pen filled gooses, leather knockouts on, Tropican' juices
One false move I'm pressing niggas, automatic buttons on 4/5ths
Nigga, what, respect the niggas


Legacy, you're the don, legacy, you're the king
Stories of the hood, lights, the fame bring
We runs the past, the strong survive
For perfection we strive, the legends alive


Yeah, what up, Rae? Yeah, living legend
They say nothing worth having comes easily
Let's go get in, buzz it down and spread it out evenly
Camouflage my rides, blend with the scenery
And bang in the face of my enemy
Divine from the waist ain't no killing me, it runs in my family
Bloodline, prepare for the best, through tough times
Fifty car caravan, anything jumping
Got the wheel real big with the rims still rubbing
But my rims ain't touching, I'm a Defcon button
I'm a Russian made Kalashnikov, motherfucker
The same thing that builds you up, ain't reserve notes
Watermarks stacked, In God We Trust
But any man can and will be crushed, heaviest move like elephant tusk
Think you better adjust the way you approach, don't get too close
Because you might get hit with a shitbag, and a wheelchair dented in zig-zag


Legacy, you're the don, legacy, you're the king
Stories of the hood, lights, the fame bring
We runs the past, the strong survive
For perfection we strive, the legends alive


Huh, Murs, yo
Now when I first started out, they said I wouldn't make it
I'm made of less metal, probably just couldn't take it
I roll with my aces, certified assassins
Mid-city militia, we come through smashing
We fucking with them butterknives, we swinging them katanas
Sharper than piranhas, cutting through your body armor
It's all about honor, man, respect the code
Touch a point on your neck and make your chest explode
And the water turns vets into vegetables
You gotta, stay on point or be the next to go
Whether, dickies or chucks, or the guess and low
It's all one love, homie, rep your coast
Cause fame is elusive, respect is the prize
Is he less of a man, you can check through his eyes
Those guys with subversive plots
Be the ones you despise, and the first to watch, hah






Someday I'm gonna be walkin down the streets
Mindin my own business.. and BAM!!
I'm gon' be shot by some pig who's gonna SWEAR
That it was a mistake
I accept that as a part of my destiny!

{*Si es mi destino morir en la calle como un perro! Hahaha*}


Whattup kid? That's right..
Yo.. aiyyo.. aiyyo..


Aiyyo let my niggas live
We show and prove get paper, catch me in the caper on shrooms yo
Let my niggas live
We real niggas that's God-body, challenge anything, make major moves
Let my niggas live
We giants, live off the land lions, post with iron, no pryin rules
Let my niggas live; aiyyo let my niggas live
Handle your bid and kill no kids


Millionaire feat, whole family eat; yo, y'all niggas is weak
Got a bird beak, chirp chirp speak
Kids that's rich that'll, run in your bitch and by the third week
Yo mark my word, me and my herb speak
That's that fire move like Schwinns yo
Invisible pens that write light, leave blends
Hit with the JF Kennedy shot
Smash with the Acapulco rifle got got
Bolt off, but got clocked
Legendary here, custom made it, shit bladed, word up
Design your alphabet, reps get graded
We in get-high saloons, big bag of shrooms, arm's length
Home of Allah's ten big rooms
So what we up in here, modelin large with rigorous moves
Exotic Gods bust my hammer at frauds
Call him a live merchant, dressed in all red, that's right y'all
Gucci jumper X-5, gettin more head




I scream at the mirror, curse, askin God, "Why me?"
Run in the black church, gun in my hand, y'all try me
I'm God-son, son of man, son of Marcus Garvey
Rastafari irie, Ha-ile Selassie
Police'll try to break us, but the streets raised us
It takes more than metal bars, we destined for ours
I hear murder plans from dopefiends, with elephant hands
Snots in they nostril, the blocks is hostile
There's no pots to piss in, Glocks is spittin
Rocks cookin underground bodies stiffin, cops look at bird shit
Drop on the window pane, the oxygen is cocaine
It drove lots of men to die with no name
I been on boats, nut down throats, pee on bitches who famous
Pretty dick, puttin stitches in they anus
I'm the animal that Hugh Heffner created
The only nigga Sade dated, the most hated, Nas nigga




Roughneck reppin the set, bang 'em twice in the neck
C.O. flip and jerk the whole yard rec
Block vets, pop barettas Glocks and tecs
You're no threat, gun talk, the language of the project
Checkin shorty with the +Black Tail+ stance, leapord pants
Yellin fuck her man, makin killings off her lap dance
Plus the young guns runnin the slums, funds is major
Drugged out, got you huntin for crumbs stuck to the razor
Semi-autos roar in the building hall
Symptoms of bloodsport, the slugs are still in wall
Call it a New York state of mind, gotta take mine
In the daytime, the Jakes'll hit ya forty-one times
So I live by the sword and obey hood laws
Make my team click like high heels on wood floors





(Chorus)
One time, one time, one time
Styles kinda different but let's be specific (2x)

(Funkmaster Flex)
This is flavor right here, 60 minutes, y'all

(Cool Whip)
You'se just wasn't ready for real, so here's the deal
No type remorse when I pull skill, kill you and your fuking horse
I'm in the midst of musical moments
Lyrical guns bust, Bible's you trust and body clocks turn to dust
Explain and slain, you turn slave, you're like Batman
Running to your bitch ass Batcave
Be aware when you witness and turn ?like Burger maids?
Got you swimming while you're dreaming and Cool Whip seamen
Headaches are like earthquakes, break you down
And crying out for you ladies, muthafuking crybaby

Chorus

(Havoc)
Foot up ?  fitted if you got work
We lying in ?sooken? put you on your back, sent you on your way
Yo, good looking, never catching the cap, the horns
In your louis in Brooklyn
Getting ?toer? from the fo'er wit the dress stower
Got the 80, oh don't think ?st.? nickel want to roll up
Get your muthafuking shit swoll up
Now it's back to Queens to serve fiends
Making t's for enemies, my eyes on my enemies
Sipping Hennessey wit my mind on some crime shit
One time searching me but never ever find shit
It's the everyday, get the loot then breeze
Still my goal is to leave out of state, push keys

(Tragedy)
The Queen's nation, representation, I represent
Bulletproof, 3 and a quarter, chrome rims and tint
Forever bent off the hen demon, niggas is scheming
My crews mega wit more gunplay then Sega
Pick up the celleur, call Capone-N-Noreaga
The nickel plated auto when I rip for dolo
Fuk one time, I'm bucking back at the poo-poo
Mr Dany got me acting like that
Squeeze macs outta state, ?sacs? one in your tracks
I'm addicted to the CREAM, I need cheese and stacks
So I'm a die trying wit AK's and Macs

Chorus

(Raekwon)
Yo, yea, yea, word up kid, word up, check it, check it, yo

It's the key money, time to get the stacks and maintain
Analyze papes, staying drape wit heavy chains
The Clan has built, pouring armaretta's in milk
Rap skin kilt flex nothing but fly silk
For real, Shaolin, house of whylin', house medallion
Peace to cats profiling on the island
Walk the view, play the view, cash in my crew
If I feel shyst, watch the ice turn blue
But for now, milk the cow wit the know how
Chef be on the low down, sidewalk chalk wit the White Owls
He, yo, niggas who bless cassettes
Peace my niggas, one love to Funkmaster Flex

(Freddie Foxx)
I'm in the hole nigga knocking in sing-sing
Barefoot in draws from jacking yours nigga cuz you saw
99 pushups, I'm fiending for the mic
I'm starting to bug the fuk out, I'm stomping on mice
They feed me like an animal, my style is mad wild
Now back in population, I refuse to crack a smile
Ever since I blew trial, my attitude is fuked up
Anybody say shit to me is getting stuffed up
Petty dope dealers, pimps and big playas
Foxx got the black rock down to rhymesayer
I'm born on one's crafty shank ripping skulls
Chopping mad niggas to the blade is mad dull

Chorus




Yeah, it goes 1, and here comes the 2 to the Three
6 Mafia, with the R-A-E
From N.Y.C. to the Memphis Tenne-ky
We ro-tote that ammo, berettas and good green
On the club dance floor, we make them bottles start to popping
In the club parking lot, we got those Glocks, body rocking
With four limos going on, there still ain't no stopping
Hypnotize and Icewater got the speakers straight rocking
With a thug on the piano, all of them glizz a bananas
Double O tre', like a letter, as with gray tape on bandanas
I hit the power like if I was Tony Montana
And make a nigga break his head like M.C. Hammer


Aiyo, it's time to take over, we the new age mobstas
Love them automatics but I stay with them revolvers
Post on the block, keep the goons in the hallway
I don't touch nothing, yo I handle mine the boss way
So keep fronting, I'mma show you what the four say
Bulldog bark like them dogs up in raw way
So act up and keep thinking you hard
All you did was get one step closer to God
And I want ya'll niggas to push me, I'mma crack his forehead
And watch him spread open like a pussy
Whoever got a problem with that, nigga speak out
Use the back of the fifth, tear a nigga teeth out
Ice dot, who you know better than that?
Gunshot put his bladder all over his lap


I don't like you, and you don't like me
So when we bump heads, tell me what it's gon' be
Let's get it, let's get it, let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's get it, let's get it, let's get it

 (D.C.)
Aiyo Cash let me get 'em (nah, Caskets let me get 'em)
Fuck it you can have 'em, I smash whose evers wit 'em
My four four mag, toe tag, whoever's riffin'
And my logo, Cash (what, Caskets, is you kidding?)
Chill, don't laugh, cuz Cash, yo, I be tripping
Cuz I know they bags, and caskets'll that'll fit 'em
(Caskets, I'mma split 'em, I'm accurate when I spit 'em
That mack clips, send bastards backwards when I hit 'em
Them shots come, back to back when I be spitting)
It's a fact, you'll be reppin' plastic from the Smith &
(I make his faggot ass do backflips from a distance
If he ever cross Cash and Caskets) You'll be missing


Bust flames at faggots, jump out the window with the ratchets
Camouflage vest on, big hatchet
Move through the city like Gotti boys, going to court
Three G suits, new blue shotty toys
Can't take nothing from us, you'll die from the get-go
Might find your head spreaded in the Pinto
Me go hard from paper, bread, yen, Euro
Make one call, my criminal bureau
Is straight now, everything, I said it, I sent it, whatever
Big daddy get yours, we been in it
Wu-Tang's foulest, Icewater's wildest
Three 6 Mafi', big papi with the Cialis






Yeah, wassup?
Roc Marc', whatup?
Flipmode y'all
Easy Mo, whatup baby?
One love, kid
Bless me on this track right here
Wu-Tang baby, whatup?
Rock' Marc' representin yea
Feature baby


Yo, yo
Testimonial flow, ceremonial head on the trophy, nigga
Tryin to ghost me, froze like frozen meat, the mosey on down
So low key, load up the soldier beat, diplomacy blow up the freestyles
Written or sold release, supposed to be wild
Some low-key shit, police stick, BLAOW!
Suffer the bust of your meat, that ain't the least of it
The beast is a dick, freakin this, believin this, the secret is
Beat at this so we can live and feed the kids
You get your feet off kid, don't spring a leak at this
Cuz in these streets, king of New York, stee
Like Biggie Smalls was this all good I could see
Sit on my political strength, like Merill Lynch
Thorough be my orchids, read your book
Defence thee, speed off the word
Magic, magic, marker thirsty, have to sling crack
Stack a fortune, back from off of me Lord
Slow the fuck up, snuggle behind me tryin to blind-side me
We sippin wine and feelin high and mighty
While Irish Rose, when I'm livin in the show
Somehow I know, and want that white beast to bring a blow, yo


You just smoked, nigga
Till ya choke, my nigga
Violating get your fuckin face broke, my nigga
Strive for the most til we all gross, my nigga
Rep for all my dogs from coast to coast, my nigga
Let's make a toast, mo' money
Let's make a toast, my nigga
Let's make a toast, nigga
Let's make a toast


We be the high post niggas who rocks the most niggas
Who pops the toast niggas, who drops the most hittas
Possessed one of the most venomous tongues
Lyrics is bio-hazardous, bite the forbidden shit, get disasterous
My mathematics too difficult for niggas to figure out like calculus
Unpredictable flow be miraculous
Funny niggas study, while y'all smoke in your nine blunts
And figure how we'll be doin it for the next nine months
Spit a million bars, that you wonder where the hook at
More sparklin shit to look at, now where the jooks at?
Climb the success ladder of the most successful crook cats
Down Memory Lane with a thousand grams of cook crack
Every now and then I look back, sometimes I put back
For once millionaire niggas, who's strive to get their look back
Clean up a local hoodrat, make sure that kids, they turnin their school books
Got thrown to pay to get their books back
In the meantime I hold a good stack, and do the observation
To reassure my motzerella conversation
Witness, have a soul, business now
We the benefactors of this whole shit, we in this now
Yo, my niggas feel how we consistently spit fire
Or get shattered and splattered if they caught up in a cross-fire
You know we give it to y'all, livin for y'all
And when we blow shit, you know we did it for y'all




Eh yo, bright, add on, mad-hatter with a rag on
No niggas cause God to spaz on
Major hieroglyphics, blood thirst, merchants up to nurtzes
Gun shot Kennedy down, we workin black churches
Spit fire, Bailey's with the tastle
Rastle of the last capsule, you ain't sellin if you natural
Underwater boat in the lake, we five boroughed out
Grace started rally, start barrel on the stage, yo
My IV on, drop a teaspoon with receivin like
Herald on a balloon, start twirlin in saloons du'
Spray up a galaxy, with hot wax, no consilary ax
Similar to John, worthy of the cracks, duke
About to blossom and deminish shit
Staten Island twist this, sublinder, relentless, Schindler's List
Grill in my shines, fly Nike's on
Shallah invite me on, yellin in the twell, "what the fuck he on?"
Just a taste of this, bass gracisness, yo
Lay on the floor, sayin prayer, your reward one
Holdin me hon', controllin me hon'
Your chore, check out the Roley dunn




When you hear the slow breathin
That is the cat from Mally Gramp camp out to say somethin intriguin
Man I spit a rhyme that's hot to death
And stop ya breath, pop in this cassette then nod your neck
Y'all know y'all been blessed with the God Banky, Baby, I rhyme greatly
Smash your crew, don't have me spit a rash at you
My cash'll do, diver chief will blast at you
You bastards, you be heavy hittas, and y'all niggas
'll love to get rid of us, but our cash flows so ridiculous
You take pictures and snap shots even of Mr. Santana
In the drop Jag, with the cop mag squeezin
Haters on the side eyein hopin that I crash the whip for no reason
When the drama comes, the white flags, they bring them out
Stupid pricks they don't know what's this thing be 'bout
Better change your route, 'fore I have to mash your mouth
Or get your arm all twisted out like Steve Stout's
Let them cowards try to come between this thing of our's
See how fast I turn them fake hard rocks back to flowers
Here's a word from your sponsor, Banky ruley marka
Number one Cream Teama, I flow meana






Yo Big what up baby
I just wanna talk to you brother, let you know man
I got super love for you, you heard?
Just a couple of bars that I wrote
I just wanted to let my presence be felt to you, you know
We love you my nigga, believe that


Yo Big what's going on good brother
Baby paw, I miss you, I wrote a dart to describe my issues
The rap game is getting too scarce
Besides in New York, the money game is getting to weird
But on another note you legend, a father with his brethren
A stepper, A Coogi sweater that's cost effected
Gangstas from the Stuy, that's you
They thought we had a beef kid, but I would never violate you
You from a part where I come from too
Just because we rhyme on a dime and had albums that blew
And that beef was a sucker beef, friendly competition
But filled with crazy love underneath
You my nigga, Yo pardon me, but I'mma be a man about it
A roll up a big fat jar of weed and smoke for your legacy Don
I shook your hand in Cali, we led by gones be by gones
This a song to a fallen hero, make no mistakes O.G
We Good Fellas, always Dinero
The movies that you made you slay'd
Rhymes was impeccable, today you are late Marvin Gaye
Every time I shine I'm thinking, we would've rocked together
One way or another we spank it
Anyway I'm just here for the love purpose
When a thug surface can't nobody judge us, fuck cursing
Casting out my love for real, youu Don'd out, gangsta'd up
Keep it real baby you the deal
Love your momma, love your seeds, this is me
Love Puff, love Kim, love Faith, love D & Cease
I'mma be easy, I just needed to breathe
And let you know I feel you like the P's
Appreciate your status my G - peace Teflon
To me you the king of the streets, one




This my letter to the rap game
Hip hop, I'm a product of the trap mane
Crack came, I didn't know how to act mane
I did what I had to do when the pack came
This is my letter to the rap game
Hip hop, I'm a product of the trap mane
Crack came, I didn't know how to act mane
I did what I had to do when the pack came


Chef what's happenin', Ghost what's up
Wu Tang Clan, they ain't nothin to fuck, wait
2 Chainz ain't nothing to fuck with
Need search warrants cause these niggas is suspects
All I talk is money so Chainz is the subject




Came in this motherfucker hundred grand strong
Two to be exact, grinding the kush pact
Ride with the roof back, live with a suit act
Killing em, so I am dying my suit black
Dear rap game, you are ill homie
Havin me thinking we were gon' make some real money
Came from the streets, I'm a beast, capiche?
Like my dick in the mailbox when the bills come, oh!
And hey rap game, the real comin'
The way I'm murking these niggas hope your will comin'
And when you're numb, it's kind of hard to feel somethin'
I'm the type to get rich and still hustle, yeah
And before I leave let me say this, play this
Have my niggas dead or in jail like Asic
Face it, back to the basics
2 Chainz on them bitches, looking like Vegas, the greatest




My worlds coming to an end, speaking philosophical
Six's on the coupe, when they said it was impossible
Got the type of guns to make the city feel uncomfortable
And we breaking bricks down, till the last molecule
Cherish the horizon, sun blessed party, hey
Thinking 'bout this business, and it's time that I gave away
Trying to make a plan today, niggas on there way
Locked in confinement, gotta learn to levitate
And on the inside, my instinct, I survive
All I got left is pride, touchdown, I'mma ride
I was raised as a boss
Damn, I let a nigga take me off
And let him tell Josh that his pops was soft
Mothafucker




Rocking blood diamonds, cooling in the hood with the goonies
Gambling and scrambling, trying to buy us some guchi's
It's a movie made, regardless, my crooks is the hardest
Buying crazy pots and pans, stay in apartments
Bank roll was all we ever needed
While niggas was weeded, playing spades, and pumping crack in adidas
Just fly young with heart, I sift in the park
Made sales, blazed a few shells, yeah fuck who you are
Guns on us, I make you cry like onions come through
Stay in your lane, peep the name and we done it
I was legend yet, now my papar stretching, yeah, that's it
Go ask the Rocky Glass, "I class act?"
Villas, movie-making gorillas, the willas
The guest-star gun fights, squeeze on the squealers
Don't come near me, nigga
If you don't got no money, fear me
Matter fact, move it, ya hear me?

I got twelve more reasons to die, snap your spinal
Selling contracted killer with the promise of life
I hope you murder them Delucas for killing your wife

But first we have to annihilate everything attached to him
Mother and fathers, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles
No one should survive this wicked war killers
Moulin Rouge models that bust pistols like Priscilla
Soon as they blow your whistle they quick to send you a missile
Down one hundred proof vodka burning your chest like kerosene
Now stop these niggas currency until they see no cream


I resurrect him, summon the killah

A human walking the earth and nothing less
Revenge is avenged when the family is diminished
You gonna rise to the heavens when our mission is finished
Ima enjoy this the second time around as a chum
I wanna brutalize and torture; cause nothing but harm
Ring the alarm, throw up the flag, rise the syndicate
Delucas reign is over at the top, we put an end to it

Reppin' this style, I'm higher than whatever in the 2000
I'm like Isaac in the ?scene age? days, gettin' 1000s
Yup, flip 'em in the M, suede Tims on
Blew housing up, they knew my niggas is proud
?Kens?, we vanish, sipping Kahluas we on the block frozen
Whatever, niggas wanna do us then do us
We like Roberta Flack and the Gap Band
And Curtis you urge us to stack grand
Scarface, we eat our grits with eggs in 'em
None of the roach legs in 'em
Watching Soul Train everybody dipped in denim
With beads on they neck and braids just like Stevie cover
You gotta see me brother, brushing my waves and now a few march
A few good men that carry cartridges
And smoke  now we all getting trim
They play the deuce loose, Old Gold juice
BVDs on, Adidas no laces, drinking pineapple fruits
But uh...

When people get shot down for not minding theirs
So many young adolescents with no careers
You got 10-11 year olds drinking beers
So many go home nigga hit up the Frigidaire, what


Rap apostle, run through pussy like a brothel
My shit's too raw, burn the flesh up in your nostril
New York City gospel, young black and hostile
Niggas making sales all day because they got to
Foul in the city I'm from we going downhill
Niggas catch beef, cock back spray a round, chill
Police giving permanent pink slips to perps
Young bitches got older niggas lifting up they skirts
That's a lack of guidance mixed with a dash of defiance
Adolescents get locked frail, come home like giants
We should go to law school instead of being lawyer clients
Respect the code of silence, big up my nigga Science
Outdoorsmen and Lowlifes got an alliance
Fuck I wanna work I'd rather hand out assignments
To uncivil civilians that post outside of buildings
On a quest for million by stacking hundred dollar Williams



Some still say Lex is a powerful man
He is still one of the most influential gangsters of all time
With a story so vivid and a mind so powerful
Who said gangsters couldn't be governors
And governors couldn't be gangsters
I know he's still around and we all have a little Lex in us
But until then, he will always be, the official Lex Diamond
We love you Lex

Lately you seem all corrupt
I've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers
Drove me to arms of another



 + (Raekwon)
(Yeah, yeah) Aiyo, how much more for a fifth of Vodka? (Peace beloved)
(Six bottles of Henny, six bottles of Henn) Word, word, let me get that
Herb, yeah, yeah.. (bring that bucket here)
Yeah (get some ice, man, two more bottles of Cru', man, word up)


I've gone through life pretending
That time will change the ending


Peace to the God (peace God) pour out a little liquor
Shame On A Nigga, I heard the reaper done came to get ya
So I done copped a fifth of, Vodka, and in your honor
I've grown this fetish for loose ladies and baby mommas
Some say it's bad karma, what you do, man, it come back on ya
Music got us up off them crack corners
Now I'mma swallow this whole bottle for Ol' Dirty
Damn, it hurts me, I hate it when brothers go early




Word to my son, he gon' remember you, rubbing on a statue
In his lab, that resemble you, and what it meant to Wu
Us forming like a family, you just blew
You was the chess piece on the board, that made us look true
Watching your pen swish, you love frying kingfish
You the pearl in the ocean, I'm up on the land, pissed
Now you moving more prestigious, me, hitting this reefer
I know it's real, guess I slept with the Black Jesus




I became weak when I heard, that his body expired
It was hard for me to believe my brother retired
Suddenly the clock stopped and the room started spinning
How can he walk off the field during the first inning?
I cried like a baby on the way to his place of death
Hate not being there, the minutes before he left
Now I'm in the booth, ten feet from where he lay dead
I think about him on this song and what he might've said




When I first heard the word, I needed air to clear my head
I know you didn't say what I thought you said, my brother's dead
You crazy, another Dirty prank to get the family cranked
Ya'll niggas shouldn't play like that, I know how you feel
Lord, but it's real, and I still can't believe
And my heart still grieves the loss, there's no pretending
Ason Unique, loved wine and fine women
We singing on tour, "ooh baby, we like it raw"




Can't pretend...
Some day it gotta come to an end
But I'mma keep you right here dog, real close to my heart
Yeah...


I popped a bottle on your born day, God
Tried hard not to cry, I still can't hide the scar
And I still ask, why to God, analyzing your form
As I stood there beside your mom
And I share the blame, cuz you was calling for help, kid
Should've, would've, could've, had the time, I was selfish
I carry on your struggle, each day it really hurts me
I really miss you Russell, hope you forgive me Dirty




Yo, these walls I wanna crash, and put my fists through
Shout out to Dirty, let the whole world miss you
Reach out and kiss you in your coffin, my heart races
I dropped tears and watch my nigga fall from greatness
It's all wasted, flushed down the drain and
Soon as the news hit me, I bust out with pain and
Rivers I cried, my brother just died
I'mma see you, my nigga, on the other side




Ah, man, how do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones that have to die
It's hard to live without you, God, I shouldn't have doubted you
When you said that The Passion of Christ was all about you
From the God Mobile, to Linden Plaza, to Brownsville
Florida to Ohio, to Putnam, to Park Hill
You interrupt the Grammy's said "Wu for the kids"
Took four or five shots when they rushed in the crib
Trey-five-seven cracked ya ribs, cops shot ya whip
You've been chased by the pigs, sold the four year bid
Crashed cars, still came out without a scar
They tried to keep ya free spirit trapped in a jar
So you'll keep ya mouth shut, and not tell the world
Who's who and what's what, and probably go nuts
How we treat them hoes? Dirt, how we treat them hoes?
We fuck 'em in the butt, Dirt




But those mistakes behind me
Cast shadows to remind me

*gong bangs*
*Sifu Shi Yin Ming reciting the Heart Sutra*




Aiyo, when we writing, yo, shit is like the vice laws
Fighting everybody wet, Lex dog, vibe on biting necks
There goes the new hammer, microwave blamp, from the stove to the roads
Down in New Hampshire, brolic size, wallet guys
Frame broiled shotties, with the Ducati's, my pockets is set
Now watch what you rep, I've been buying niggas heads
Wall crawler, Captain Caveman, in the hall scrawling
Money is stacked up, better than yours
Do with the rappers, clap niggas, slap 'em, and car jack 'em
Everything niggas is serving, is crack, what, preferebly Kelloggs
You just a goldmine, yup, cereal bowls of heroin
Yup, the Don Baron, it's worth hundreds, say something
Niggas fronting while we doubling, pump 'em
And lay 'em right in front of the steps
The new Mark Cuban, Mavericks, we moving like Arabics
Faces is wrapped, crosses on like Catholics
Blend to the music, it's all in the game


Riding through life in this fast lane, fast change
Ya'll deal when the lights green, but when that light change
You gotta make a slight change, use your wipers
Cause it might rain, life's a gamble like a dice game


Aiyo, I'm when I'm writing I be thinking like Donald Goines
Posted up on the strip, fishing like bitches hoeing
Blowing like Jesse Owens, run laps around these tracks
And I stay up in the hood like, weed and cracks
Damn right, I still pack the strap, duck if I whip it out
But if I whip it out, you're people will be picking out
A coffin and a tombstone, park 'em in the graveyard
Prayers and a leap of faith, probably couldn't save ya'll
That's the path of bravhearts, clap you in the hallway
Turn two o's that soft, into three the hard way
Move the diesel all day, shut it down in night time
That's when the undercovers buy, in night time
Move to the forefront, Ratch' had the store front
First I had two goals, now I got more front
Bitch I been G'd up, put a O in front of that
Keep them bitches ski'd up, blowing off each other's back


Riding through life in this fast lane, fast change
Ya'll deal when the lights green, but when that light change
You gotta make a slight change, use your wipers
Cause it might rain, life's a gamble like a dice game


Heavy white ice, gold ornaments, hustle and life
Hustle and light, good wit the pill
Be at all the tournaments, stroll in the beach
Out in Luv Allah, we love all of ya'll
Killah Hill, Staten Africa, rap massacre
Make a phone call, have niggas get at cha
Rat ya, two double nines in the back of the Acura, it's a Don thing
Don King, Don bitches under the ring
We don't ever sing, raps get cut in the bing
Posse up, see me the Beemer or Benz truck
Reppin' that W, it's trouble for you
Knife through ya bubble goose, veterans loose, 39 on the deuce
Pick it up, stick it up, niggas is thinking to bust
Breaking these states for they cake, you know what it do
What's up, Goldie? Niggas wanna march, hanging wit Jody
Street Flavor click, roll thicker than shit
We the upmost, faggot niggas get bitched
Smacked wit the toast, crackin' the line in the coke
Niggas'll cutthroat, cutthroat, infered on top of the scope
Crack in the dial, mixed with soap, Killah Island...




Heard if you jerk off too much you probably go blind nigga
It's probably why I don't see you niggas
Tan Tims, construct joints
Caught 'em up at Hunts Point
Starting speaking Mandarin, fly when he scrambling
Always caught gambling, big bricks he handling
Started talking about all the coke and the heron
I pulled into Exxon, put my bitch Deb on
Course she caught the weapon, the female you slept on
And I don't trust homes as far as I can throw him though
Laughing and I'm joking but I'm acting like I know him though
He bust a key open and sniffed an eighth in front of me
I ain't give a fuck as long as he didn't try to fron on me
Goose bumps flowing from the alcohol consumption
We on the block working still pumping open junction
Frequently I met with his crew shit secretly
Plottin' 'cause they hate him
It's cool if they eat with me
Plus they heard about my style
They don't want beef with me


Mafioso so they know I got the heat with me
Mafioso so they know I got the street with me
Mob niggas eat with me, pretty bitches sleep with me
Rough life but steet dons living easily
Mafioso so nigga you supposed to pay
Mafioso so nigga we supposed to spray
You ain't got money, see us, you can hold some yay
But you can never sleep
Nigga it's forever beef


Brought 'em to the meat store
Chopped it with the ham hocks
Then we sent the fingers to his man and his mom's spot
Do 'em with the cow meat, said a prayer over him
Now they he halal meat, mince meat, foul feet
Do the rest to his body in Jers in Secaucus, Queens
Boulevard, the meeting, diner met in Georgia
Hit the city with the Taurus, we heard they looking for us
Them niggas know my math ain't a damn so call us
But we ready for war so hit 'em in the torso
Hittin' bosses, lieutenants and soldiers also
This is the Latin black Costra Nostra
Hit ya with the coacha coacha
Testarosa wanted poster, hood-style roller coaster
Still I hit the roach I hold the toaster with the holster




Hey yo we smoke quarters
Fuck with some hoes, sly record 'em
We snatch 'em up, gut 'em and throw 'em back in the water
Eating only pasta kids
Mobster kids running Red Lobster shit
Yoke you from your dreads twist a rasta spliff
Hussein Bolt with a coat
Adidas on sweats sitting up in a boat
Lit it throat, my ninja's blood thirsty they won't
Be 'round you circle niggas that poke
Drop the coke
Cartels maxing in Gazelles eating scallions
 eat chow with Italians, more Valiums
Paying judge's Las Vegas mug shot
This is the rug spot lift and whiff you
Rinse and rip you
I'm at the table, eat your lentils






We celebrate by blowing some grass, the mighty green
I'm on the third floor in the crib up in the wifey Beamer
Breaking down plates and charging niggas
Prices is high, don't try to argue niggas
You might get a job from niggas
Yesterday's hopes is yesterday's quotes
They trapped my son, them bastards is done now, they ghost
Sipping Martini cucumbers, watching the crew's numbers
I'm in Cazals, Raymond Weils, and Miguels
Spanish house of love, mi casa su casa
Two rastas with me, who the bumba...?
High tech Macs for faggot niggas
Niggas don't wear Airs no more, they wear Chanels, word sale
Outta their face if they funny niggas
Look at these creatures, no hope, no gear
Niggas needed me to teach 'em
I'm at the swap meet with shorty
Me, Top, Phife and Life
Perry and Soup, Molly and Mike
With 17 bad Wis's all over age, you crazy
Them bitches is millionaires with babies
Suits on A-Team, hundred  goose on
Watch  time, I know my rooster calling
Wild, wearing wing tips that's high top
Hit the spa shop, two cameras to go, niggas know
And after that, two days of rest, yeah right, you white
We ain't slept for years, but we right
Dedicated to the gun game, we toast to the best
For 20 years niggas blessed, alright stressed
You think I'm laughing to the bank, but I'm crying yo
Can't even spend it with loyal niggas, they're grimy
Even your boys will try to blind me, be strong, pa, we from the 90s
Stick together, then get dip together
No more days of extortion, I had my portion
Because I was just dumb, deaf and exhausted
All love, but no pound, see the baby peace chant
You got some breadsticks, shawty? What it be? Blamp me
We in the high rise with Jack Daniels drinking with George Daniels
Some niggas absorb, this a whore scandal



  Yo, you know what I mean? Chillin within
 Word up, niggas is stupid
 Look out for the cops man, look out for the cops
 Yo it was on last year Son
 Huh? Fuck
Them cops

Niggas
 Niggas want two hundred grand over the table

 Oh no no no no no no no
 Get your shit right

 We gonna swerve on these niggas one time that's my word
{*music fades in*}
"What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility"
 That's comin from Louis Rich
 Baggin, you know what time it is, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo


Put them cracks down you just started slanging two months ago
What up with Larry Francisco tell him to let that bitch go
Why you standing there? Posing you like Donna Karan wear
Nigga save that, the same shit you had it last year
You be running with them outsiders
That shit is fucked up yo, we never turn to dick riders
Your Mac is big, got a little grip, yo
You think that shit gon live what he did -- what this nigga said
Remember when his mans got there, the whole shit was set up
Shut up, whole fam want the science and the letter
It got back to me some niggas in Medina askin me
"You know some niggas in the gold E-Class," splash to me
Yo that shit you had in Vegas
Yo, it could have got us both sprayed up
They seen the Ac, noticed Jada
Hair salon, treating shorty like Quran
Her fam major swing kingpins you won't dare front on
Octavia with all the ice on, yo
She own a car wash now, her little Keon doing triple life
Marry a Son who got baked, it coulda been
For a half a cake, play the shank, maybe bite her
Shit is fucked up when they got us yo
She fainted at her baby wake now watch the breakdown
"..face responsibility"
She fainted at her baby wake now yo watch the breakdown

"Little ghetto boy, playing in the ghetto street"


Yo all of y'all niggas got the whole story wrong
Talk what you talk but twist the real song
When it comes down to this, not a licensed driver
Show y'all niggas whose style is more liver
This is not a act this is more actual fact
Nothing but experience placed upon track
With the true sound, not lying out the crown
When we not working we hardly be around
Yeah see the light, right now we could fight
You not a real brother you just a fake type
That get on the mic then throw your clich
Half the East coast sounding just like Rae
If you a Gambino, give credit to the flow
If you not a part of this kid act like you know
Fuck the studio, Cappaccino the great
Fly cherry head niggas like planes out of state
I ain't friends with you, only my CD hit you
If you want some then stop fronting is the issue
It's my turn, live niggas could pass
Two-faced rappers push they shit last
Straight off the edge into the rubbish
Peep my new style fuck Cristal and Moet
I drink Evian water while my darts get published

"What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"

"Little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto streets
What you gonna do when you grow up..."

"What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"

"Little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto streets
What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"

{*35 seconds of instrumental pass until the martial arts samples*}

One is invulnerable, in fact
It involves strenuous breath control
Out of all techniques, it's the most difficult
The human body has a hundred and eight pressure points
Thirty-six of these can be fatal
The remainder, paralyzing




Li-li-live from New York (2x)
Is you watchin what's on my motherfucking neck nigga?
Li-li-live from New York (2x)
Live from New York


All white bolon, the allie pulled on
Kept his fade low, rocked swade in the snow, blue Tahoe
A wizard on the keyboard, eyes look bloodshot lord
Nevermind that, claim the award
In the system we just missed 'em
Came through banging nothing but Wu, the crowd blitzed 'em
Much love, autograph, carryin the champagne glasses
Crazy asses, niggas on his neck like ski masks
Chill step on me, axe slash through a little fifty and crash
I wanna drink, knew she'd pocket the cash
Buck summer night hype nigga, Iron Man blowin the mic
You motherfucking right, live highlight
Then I seen him, nigga was raw, stepped in
Bitches flexin' next to him, bad Mexicans
What up showin' you love, you got a real style
"Where you from?", "The Isle", that's Staten Isle, love no doubt
Oh God, he had a drink about a hundred
Some strange nigga think he had a range, God got blunted
Pay attention this essent' like sacks and macks
He did the knowledge, ran to the bar and grabbed stacks
Now the whole parties bubblin', niggas got love his bug
He had on one glove, rollin' up drugs
Him and his Vikings ran through, stopped played the back then they walked through, Live from New York where niggas hawk you


Gettin money and laced up, Live from New York
Gettin' reefer to blaze up, Live from New York
Gettin' niggas to dance and yellin', "Throw both hands up"
Won't pull your pants up, Live from New York


Madonna money in our pocket, boating in a rocket
Bout to blast off, we charged like a socket
Whips be cleaner than a fuck, jewels basically struck
Strait up Brolox style laying in the cut
Bottles strictly Dom, ring the alarm
Rollie on the arm, arms crossed, new sneakers on
Fly shit, Nikes the majority
NYC state of mind and we talk with authority
5 Boroughs is sterile, still out of town playing mellow
I thought I seen Shalon swade yellow
Rippin' it, new six flippin' it
Shorty is drip dippin' in it when she sit, throw dick in it
Came to conclusions, what's the solution when your losin'?
Respect mine, now from the foul line
Streets is a part of us, teaching the seeds through the heart of us
Some get locked, that's a scar on us






I deserve to play, it's been a few days, ain't showed it all
I go outside and breathe, roll down my sleeves and have a ball
Still got these bills to pay and a family, I'm workin hard
But I got a life too, so I throw on my shoes and I live it y'all


I'm fresher than a peppermint and cold as a cough
When I pull up in that foreign and I break boys off
Super ballin is a product of a hard knock life
No more Ramen noddles spread, no more struggle and strife
From a Buick to a Beamer, ambitions of a dreamer
Motivated by Mob Figaz and Andre Nickatina
I'm gettin paper while you're in the shade drinkin Zima
I'm a schemer, you just waitin on your check from FEMA
Been evadin the subpoena to appear in court
Different hustle every season like I'm playin a sport
"Life is Too $hort, wouldn't you agree?"
See, the best time I ever had in my life was free
My best friend wasn't real, he came with a fee
Reduced time for your sentence come with a plea
Livin in the free world and I'm blessed
Paper chasin is my quest, I grind with no rest




I'm not an actor, a role model with soul or clapper
I work hard, a good gangsta nigga, blow a stack up
Time still movin and shit, stay on the grind, it's just excuses
Girls lookin at you, you useless (word?)
When everything is wrong, it look like it'll fall
I'm on the job feet first with direction and all
I like coca and then gotta come home and stroke her
Take time, clean my rims and go loc' her
Just wanna lay up, damn
I need two minutes to rest, go 'head and take the Lex' out, scram
Then it's beef in the jump off, cause I needed one off
It's like you drew your gun on me in a gun off
Shit won't change, so move with it (move with it)
This is my life, I'm only livin it, so don't go and ruin it
Words from a legend, keep your dome up in the sky
Listen to Paul Wall and Chef Fly (get high)




Dear Mr. President, have you seen FEMA?
Have you seen the lower 9th Ward, post Katrina?
Niggas scufflin tryin to find something tangible
The impedes is treatin all the youth like animals
Then wonder why the cops gettin rocked like Mosley
Why niggas on the TV in the spot like cozy
Now Houston got a problem, Atlanta got a problem
Dallas, Alabama and Miami got a problem
Niggas wildin out, livin free, yellin sovereign
.38 revolvin, crack rock ballin
Tats on they face that say Uptown New Orleans
Blastin on sight, fuck fightin, fuck arguin
Meanwhile boat loads of cash go to Israel
Soldiers in Iraq pray to God for a miracle
Sam Cooke said that change was comin
If not, you can bet your ass, danger's comin






Ayo gas station Sammy, rich nigga live in Miami
They killed him and lived with his family
He was drunk spazzin' on a young nigga with cash
They did the best to him, whooped his ass
Bloody out, his ear was ripped, they know he loved his music
They poked him twice, his gear was ripped
Ninja style, niggas whipped him with a Benz belt, broke his arm
Crushed his Audemars with whelps
On his face, they was slappin' him, fake ass rapper
Old ass gun, pussy get Tinactin
Medicine face, nigga, they opened his mouth
A few gold fell out, wheel him out
He thinkin' he a gangsta? Quit playin', listenin' to Sid and them
Because he sat up in bed to bid with 'em
Fishcakes, bubblegum shrimps in his Timbs
He had 12 and a half on, only wore 10
Niggas is lame, and I'm sayin'
All that hard, no damn frame, how you playin'?
Thought you bubble with the big Willies, flyin' in fast cars
And get busy, now he sittin' there lookin' dizzy
Don't look at Chef, nigga look at your rep
What dinosaur game you playin'? They playin' death
Tax man comin', you can feel it
Besides, hold the ratchets in both arms
They gave it to him, peel it

 x2
Kill niggas, let it die, live with the feelings
We don't know no other way, just get millions
Pyrex kings and the cartels, connect in Scarsdale, put your money up and 


Indian Femi from Toronto
Him and his horse, , two wild sopranos
Runnin' through ice, and niggas fall back
They bumped in the crunch, 
Used to wash them niggas up for chump change
Somethin' was strange, feds was listenin', ran out of the gun range
Son I feel vibes, not knowin' this was the time
To get away, but they rolled on alive
Black freeze out of the bushes, 
Big three pound, four of them were beams
When they rushed him they cuffed him, we cussed them
Yo what the fuck? You doin' life, lil' nigga, who the sucker, what?
Black was mad, he went for the cop's mag
They started , the shot rang, that's bad
Black fellow was , like 33 Ds
Let off 100 shots, went mad

 x2




The power of observation
Marvels and frights and strange delights
Attributes, properties, disciplines and novelties
Ecstatic patterns in the calendar design
Wilderness tours, guided by and for the blind
Cool ruler standing still sweating through the shades
He knew those lights only grew bright to fade
Dead wrong pageantry, lottery and games
Sleight of hand provided by extravagant and fake
The carnival tilt bell the hustle for the age
They clutch what they covet, what must they give away?
Who was uninvited who was asked to come and stay?
Surprise, it's your life, it's your business anyway
So please pardon these and such curious minds
Peace, safe passage, precious time hither and gone
The day of days, Yawm al-Qiymah
This tiny stone illuminated by a star
The only star so large many more
To make our largest star show small
Furthermore, the end is not the end no stop but a pause
And what we can witness isn't all there is at all
Custom mock of a scotch and pork chops
The passion, expansion, the order of the random
See the dreamers, see the sleepers
Why'd you wake them?
Sweet Jesus and life on Earth
Seek heaven first
Let's put in this work


Her heels set the mood
Where did you acquire those Alaia's
When I met you I heard Jesus, bells, strings, and the choir
I got lines that's better than niggas' albums, plural
The king of the urban make your shit sound rural
She said I hit it so deep she need a epidural
Them other niggas have you looking like a squirrel
Now that nuts. I only hang with white boys that like black sluts
Tell them Plain Pat yo that track sucks
We ain't dissing you
But you in the position to play something for us to listen to
I'm trying to worry about my scratch minus the crabs
I ain't stopping for you niggas like yellow cabs
I got scripts so why we need a movie?
And if I'm a douche then put me in your coochie
I swear they should have never gave these niggas loose leaf
And excuse me if I'm trapped by the boobies, booby trapped


All white Bentley, I call that mama
My life crazy, like Obama's
You talk slick? Well I'm Osama
Bin Laden, I'm what's happening I get it cracking
All black Carbon on my wrist yeah
It's gonna take you a couple years to get this here
Thank AP, well they thank me
And I be mad too if you ain't me
Call me Mr. Dean or Mr. Bars
See me riding clean in a Rolls Royce
Niggas talking funny, that's old money
Niggas looking crazy but they talking funny
Nowadays rappers, they like bloggers
You see me, I'm a bank hogger
Coming through your hood in a Brinks truck
With 25s on it like what the fuck
100 feet and better, what the fuck use stick
Paparazzi on the water what the fuck use stick
My face got the "fuck you pricks"
My beats go hard like fuck you dicks
Pouring champagne damn thing
See me rocking suede, nigga, in the damn rain
Ain't a damn thing, money ain't a damn thing
Ask Yeezy and Mos we do the god damn thing


Ay yo open glass on my fingers
I sit back like I'm caged but still caking
My niggas is hating
It's like being in the livest Lambo in the hood
You a piece of steak I'd rather be that than some bacon
Every project is a throne only just bigger
Stones they throw that's why I wear a big hat and roll weed
Gone if you don't know where you came or when you came
All you know is weed and cocaine
Nonbelievers no game
I'm zooted down, rolling a spliff, maxing
Flaming like wheels got traction
I'm sun he's attractive
Guaranteed to service the real niggas
Out cruising in a Volvo, a duffle for dolo, buffy polo
A blow house is where I resided once
Live amongst fiends, counting currency, hitting blunts
Only to hear the door rumble, grab the 4
Hope it ain't the law
Or maybe some nigga trying to score




Lost my way
Fell down a hole
No-ones gonna come and save my soul
Lost my way
No going back
I'm stuck right here, and that is that!


Look around this manor and all you'll see
Is ill mannered people iller mannered
Than the illest mannered person
You've ever met in your manor
Or are ever likely to meet
In any manor, cause this manor's deep
You judge them on the life that they lead
But then it's not all as black and white as it seems
They're all some way enslaved and their circumstances
Shape the way the behave in their battle on the street
That's why these kids ain't got no hope
Walking round there estates thinking "this is it"
They ain't ever getting out and it's no joke
Probably is the best of live they're ever gonna get
They don't believe they can succeed
Or the opportunities you send back there really exist
Cos they've been told every day from the minute they were born
By their fucked up parents that they ain't shit
Mum and dad never made nothing of themselves
Nah, so why the hell are they gonna?
School's a waste of time, there only gonna fail
Their older brother went jail, why ain't they gonna?
I mean they hang with thugs, and sell drugs
Ain't afraid to put a couple of slugs in you if you say something
They ain't all that way but you don't care either way
To you they're all just the same a bunch of thugs


The youths that are out everyday
Working for the devil's plan
The young souls that went astray
Listen when you hear him say




The end is so hard, rockload all day pose
Fronting in the yard full of guards
Everybody fully equipped, clips with fullies, we the bullies
Make sure you float for the large
Always in fights, gun nights, whites
And ice with harpoons and the goons will slice you
Do it all for a money bag, flash the mag on your skull
Pull it, then let off a hundred fast
Usually in the coupe, no roof
Boots is loose laced
Fronting in the snow beach goose
Everything on the family, cover your son
One for one, bring horror like Ammity Ville
Come to the hill, multiple shots fly
Young niggas die in the field
Youngins better stand for the hammer
For there is no one in time
It's all in your mind
I'm laying in prison






If you don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
(And if that happens then you've lost your way)
If you don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
(And if that happens then you've lost your way)
If you don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
Don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
Don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
Fall for anything, fall for anything
Don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
Don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
Don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
Fall for anything, fall for anything!

Du-du NUMBER 1
Dance hall storm
Yo yo yo yo




This the Terrordome, where niggas get tied up, Berretta blown
Or whip the vanilla 200X lebanon
Doofie gauge, 38s, 300 rebels strong
Out in Grenada, chilling snow pebbles on prosperous
Hugh Heffs who fucking his steps
Favorite color purple, we would circle the jets
He talk base, in a I-8 racing clear doors we face
In life, in trying to get away from these whores
Or rolling uptown in gambling stores
Stealing clothes in Macys, running out with like five, six Valores
Thug couple Rugby boys who get fly and break jaws
And take papes the stakes is yours


Rae told me victorys unexpected
They hating on my chain, misery from a necklace
See my YouTube and hear me spitting, know Im reckless
First nigga ever selling metaphors on Craig's List
Fresh shit, we on it, no matter what the joint
You the Hornets, you lost Chris Paul, whats your point?
I could spit a freestyle and be on
This beat feel like I should rhyme with some Wallabees on
I would wrong if I told everybody get your weight up
But back to the real shit, that wave up, phase up
If he owe me dough, I hope that he pay up
Hand on that trigger when that finger roll hell lay up
Wait up, its just homicide humor
I couldve bodied you sooner
I just provided the rumor
Whatever he rhyming on, Ill bring it to you
Im a phenomenon, Travolta with the tumor


Blowing exotic kush, watermelon flavor, no seeds
Burn it by the O-Z, imported from O-T
Export it from T-O, salute to the OG
Flips is high risk, but the moves is low key
Young hustlers, dreaming about awards and tours
The world is ours, and any store accepting the credit card
Bought her: fly boosters, designer shades, and all that
Hit it in the back, then fell back in the callback
Im busy chasing paper on the cash rule major
All we do is see numbers like an old school pager
Double your wager, we busy clocking like Flavor
Time waits for no man, man dont be a hater
Land of opportunity, keep your mule and forty acres
Id rather forty mill and own a piece of the Lakers
Dancing with devils, and two stepping with saints
We young, black, and getting it, everything that you aint  ever

Sorry hood niggas go against good niggas, Regulate the gate
Tap many states, Still hit hood bitches
Money green leathers, Gloves on, Drugs on niggas

Chickens love rims, Brims on wool coats and tims
Nails done up the color of their beige skin
Let me 2-way the rap game, Who love the rap game
Fuck them niggas who ain't, And I'll smash that nigga
Dumped in the biggest river, Savage, You can't fuck with lavish
And I'm here now, I'ma say it again yo

Press that button right there, grab a Beck's
Legendary alive
Silks on frontin' at LIV, still the flyest
Black Gatti seats violent
Wu pirate, boo pilot, check the nigga drive out
Realer shits, they whip me
Keep it real, dealerships, they dig me
Dungaree bling, monster king
Walk through the joint, get praised like Jah rollin' weed
Leathers in all flavors
Taught niggas how to get fly and flip spaceships
Rock mad diamonds and strive, see the bracelet
Ask Ghost where the evil come from, don't say shit
Caesar's, no skeezers
I could get you barred from Europe, no visas
Take a little piece of your world, change your season
Put a fresh tech to your face, now squeeze this
Peace to my nigga 40
Sixty others keep it a buck, what's real? Call me
Fila suits, day one, just a shorty
Eat skirt stakes with snakes, Gore-teezys
Yes, Gore-tex, techs techs
My niggas shoot up the complex
Rae's so complex
That's right, it's so gracious when a don flex
He 'bout checks, feedin' his seeds and family
Swiss accounts, livin' in Whistler with the good stuff
Sit back and wrote, 20 years later
A GOAT now, Capricorn killer on the float
Night trips while niggas is sleep
I live in a pillage, where niggas cook coke up all week
But that's not my lingo, ain't bumpin' no heads like Ochocinco
Rather be in Santa Domingo
On a beach, newspaper callin' with a few shakers
Barbecue wings with a few neighbors
Huntin' gear, tryin' to shoot gators
Yeah, put 'em on and chop up a few blazers
Back to the culture, luxury things that's leanin'
Me and my team gon' stay feinin'
FILA comin', y'all, we cleanin'
Now what's the meanin'? Remember this






April 2nd 1939, the stars is in line
Divine intervention at it's own intention
Birthed a gift, in this DC kid, he sung heavenly
Good values and all and his father was in the ministry
God fearing man with a mother that's so beautiful, the angels would serve her
What's her name? It's Alberta
This little boy quickly became a man
From blowing in his father's church, to making his own band
Called the Moonglows, sensational with his vocals
That drove the ladies crazy, panties got thrown at his shows
But he was far from happy, he wore a smile just to hide it
Behind them doors him and his father constantly colliding


Marvin, the sound of your voice
Sets fire to my soul
What a glory to behold
Marvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how
I just hope you're happy now


Destined for greatness, counting his blessings
Young'uns struggling with pressures
That the fact that his pops was a cross dresser
But he still loved him, you know the bond between his son and father
That only pushed him and forced him to sing harder
His main man Harvey Fuqua gassed up his car
Believed his sound
And took him down to Motown y'all
That's where it all happened
Success in the palm of his hand
But unfortunate the fame wasn't enough
He wanted more out of life
Took it further and found himself a wife
Pretty Anna Gordy, she made his time sit still
She was the cousin of Barry G, the founder of Hitsville
Please pay attention because the story it gets ill
Shit's real, trials and tribulations son's facing
You gotta play the cards you're dealt
Ain't no telling what life deals
Death will cause you to have night chills
Enough to keep a nigga bothered
Especially when the negatives start coming from your father


Marvin, the sound of your voice
Sets fire to my soul
What a glory to behold
Marvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how
I just hope you're happy now


Money, women and drugs came into play
Now wouldn't you know, there goes another happy home down the drain
That night life had him speeding through hell
Scarred by the death of Tammy Terell
Couldn't believe it, he spiraled downhill
Secluding himself, from the music and the press
He was sick and really getting depressed
Time passed so he bounced back on track
New and improved
Even got himself a new wife too
Everything is on the up and up, got his act together
Spiritually he claims, you could see the glow up on this fella
Tried to make amends with his father
But the hatred is too strong, revolver in his palm
The warning that death was close
His mother screaming out "Honey don't do it!"
One shot to the chest made Marvin lose fluids
April 1st he died on the spot the scene was so horrific
How a father could kill his own son defines wicked


Marvin, the sound of your voice
Sets fire to my soul
What a glory to behold
Marvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how
I just hope you're happy now


Marvin
Marvin
It's the sound of the music
Marvin
Marvin
Marvin




Wanna fuck with me? (Let's go, let's go, yo
Got my brother Cee Allah in here, no doubt, no doubt
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo, aiyo, let's do it Lord)


It goe live from the jump off, I dump off shells
Drink liquor so pure, you get drunk off smells
Dog, I ain't rappin' to fail
I'm tryin to stash mil', so I can have money for bail
So when you actin' out of pocket, I blast rockets
Just coke, weight it up, cook it, cut it, chop it
Bag a ho, take her home, gut it, drop it
Give it six months, Ranjahz floodin' the market
With, thugs and thieves and, that come out in the evening
And sleep all day, it's the Brooklyn way
When we cop new cars, just to build new stashes
Fuck menopause, my guns give you hot flashes
Wais, I put a rapper corks in the hole
And tattoo my skin, cuz it's only close for the soul
Bitch nigga, get you knowin' role
Hop you dancin' ass on stage, get to knowin' a pro
I flow lithium, and rap vikadin, every verse is a classic
It don't even make no sense bitin' them
Two ten, it don't make no sense fightin' 'em
We hate you, it don't make no sense likin' them
All hoods, I'm invitin' 'em
Step in the square, I'll Tyson 'em, spit with the kid
I got a sixteen gauge, that'll shift your ribs
Put my face on your record, it becomes a street hit


This ain't rap motherfucker, this is Masaqua Muzik
Manson, Charles & Marilyn, forget about dancin'
Niggas can't see me, forget about glancin'
Your raps too handsome, the game is ugly
My whole life is like Vegas, I live it to gamble it
This one is for my niggas on the block, still scramblin'
Or trapped in the box, pray to be a free man again
You know the H.A.P.H. is rippin'
Bout to blow like an airbag, when the whip lose handling
Crash dummy niggas, I ain't worth battlin'
Spiced ham niggas, we can never be fam again
Listen to my venom and respect how I channel it
I spit that '86, rap attack, air a staircase
Dollar bill with the straw, smack every letter
Drama crack, here a scary pity pack era
And I still don a party, if I can't get the better end


Introducing nothing but fly hands, call me Saddam
Only thing I got is bombs
Lex, let the bell ring, yo, eat well
Twelve niggas heads and bling, if not, send 'em to jail
He got new joints, chest like bulky, similar to The Hulk
Green weed, can't believe he bumped me
Young kid, dressed flashly, peep the New York Times
Got an article on how to read rhymes
Yo, caught me in the Journal, thermal set
Feedin' 48 laws, gain power, changin' us all
Thus me, The Ranjahz, the young angels
Agust the flames, little mic piece in the Range
Top niggas, cuz we get live, ride high niggas
Yo, run up and body niggas, chew 'em on stage
Yeah, criminals, have to eat food
Sit back, yo, absorb the message, grin it, cuz it's due




Now we are the masters of our fate
That the task that which has been its not above our strength
That its pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance
As long as we have faith in our goals
And unconquerable will power
Salvation will not be denied us!
Salvation will not be denied us!
We are the masters of our fate!


The time has come, I just begun, this is designer rum
My wallet got flowers on it, killer cowards from milan
The stolen land where gold chains control a man
300 holdin hands, stolen grams
I play the fan, and wave and leave that nigga for dead, or should I save him?
Spittin out phlegm, no, just grave him
I remember days I used to work for niggas, eat jerk with niggas
Buyin whippids, laughing at jokes and try to flip
Clip is loyal, fly spoil on the block, display royal
Even though we go back to royals, black oils
Live as ever, cant tell me nothing
Whatever this thing of ours is empowered by my niggas who pumping
24 hours of sling motion, wave brush
Ya'll knew my hair was the ocean
Running through the building just nego-tion
Some of the creeps knew me very well
Knew he would sell, knew he was potent




Ok, bridges I burned some, lessons I learned some
Money I spend some, lent some, earned some
My eyes tell a tale of the hell I returned from
Spark up a L for the homies I haven't heard from
Burn when the urge come
Im living lurge(large)
Never chilling on the curb, just a villian on the verge, son
My tenth shot is as official as the third one
Second one, first one
Worse come, the worst run
When I was pushed out of the womb the earth spun
The only way to describe this is inertia
Some rappers think they could try me, Who the first up?
I dont guarantee no survivers, nigga surfs up
Yeah, soul on ice, courage and sacrifice, hold on tight
And save your laughter for the afterlife
These chumps thinkin they good, ain't even half as nice
Your fate will be a one-way ticket to paradise






You got your hands on Mooney shit?
Say word
We gon' get high
I don't give a fuck about them
He a bird anyway
He be taking his packages?
He a snitch too


Ayo
In Pam's house there was money missing
She was too dumb, had her nose numb, sniffin' blow in the kitchen
Her kids never ate, BCW's involved with her
Kids that she never seen shipped two to Florida
Maxine dark skinned and bald headed bitch mean
Pam's right hand, together they're the coldest fiends
Aww shit, guess who arrived at the door
It's Mooney the supplier, "Shh, don't open the door!"
"Bitch open the door!" "Maxine, he gon' kill me!"
"Chill, I got a friend cop." "Girl, you don't know his beef!"
Three long kicks the hinges flew off
Kids screaming, the heavy face slap blew Maxine head off
It's on in the crib, "You wrong for what you did
You gon' pay Pam, fuck that boo, kiss your kids
Y'all get the fuck in the room.""Fuck you, you ain't our real Daddy!"
"Next time you see my Caddy, don't fucking flag me"
This is where he fucks, up at peep his movements
Maxine's in the kitchen crying, grits is boiling, on the side
She had a cup of lye, somebody gotta die
"Uh huh, y'all bitches fucked up, smoked out my packages


Y'all had Mackie shit and Pappy shit
Word to Aunt May I want mine"
Pulled out the nine, get in the tub
He seen the hot iron pulled the plug out
He steamed Pam brought it back to Penny on Good Times
Back in the dollar bill he sniffed like six lines
He put his Gat down, why he do that?
Creeping through the crib is Maxine, pot holder down with the grits
Pam sucking his dick, Maxine Al Greened him
Screaming, slipped in piss, he ran in the seed's room
Grits down cryin' aight with his balls out
He stepped on Clarence Biggie Smalls album
"Boobie get that nigga!" Pam yelling, "Rip that nigga!"
Mookie went and got the dye out the kitchen
James jumped on Moon, poked him with a screw driver
Broke the TV, niggas watching Knight Rider


This is Pam Jerkins mother house
The same shit go on in her brother house
You know Mooney's only a buck oh five wet
He only had two hundred dollars worth of shit
And the kids tore his ass up


The seeds had a huddle up, I felt sorry for him
The funny shit when bowlegged Keke hopped on him
Jumped on him, pigeon toed Mookie poured dye on him
You should've seen this motherfucker's face frying
Half dying, they stuck a fork through his nuts
The little girl was happy, she picked her brother up
"Quick, pick the window up," Mooney overheard
Right before they threw him out, the nigga said "Word?!?"

On the count of three
He landed right in front of the first floor balcony
Blood, brains is splattered
He was dead
And the cops never came
That's Stapleton


All, all, all in together now
We getting fresh getting right for the weather now
And if we fall in the game, yo that's never now
Come to my projects and we'll air you out




(Aiyo, Chef?) What up, my nigga?
(Yeah, man, I gotta give you the 411, shit is straight 911, word)
It's $2.50, nigga, back the fuck up! Talk to me...
(Word, them blue ninjas is everywhere
Word, watch ya back, Protect Ya Neck and all that shit, man
Thirty nine motherfuckers already got scooped up
Indicted, word, I'm bird eye viewing it right now
Out there out the motherfucking window)
You got the strong scoopers out there?
(Word, five book store buses out front
All them young boys are certified, they ain't rentals)


Run these mean streets from Cali to New York
Who could ya trust? Niggas they do talk
Running from the feds and out of state troopers
Look up ahead, you know we got sharp shooters


The blocks is molded, step up ya sword piece
Moving through them housing with more ki's
Rembrandts is fresh from Scotland, crisp hats, Cristal bottles
Niggas want the problems, we back
It's time to take over the game, it's nothing
I live on the line, from corner to castles with pawns and capsules
Scramble and find, my money's up, I'm praying for war
I do this all the time, all the time, all the time
Faces of Doom, sling in the lobby
Swinging cooked raw, if you played the field you was not leaving
Fast-pacin' for CREAM chasing team
Trying to come through the hood and lie, get left for dead naked in Queens
Let them other niggas wear that, we take the credit
While we was shopping for more Nikes and off-whites
Heroin stirrers, the crib, cracked mirrors
Career thugs who serve only judges and jurors
Got to make my money this year, whether it's through rhyming or criming
I'll be on the line with my iron
Promised them llamas'll fly fast, quick at pirahnas
Trying to intervene, get caught dead, no head in pajamas
You live like a slouch from vouchers
Nobody mad, you was a fake, dead, die with no trousers
Cause you crossed the line like Miller's Crossing
Off with ya dome, I walked you through the woods, we both smoked a bone




Mean streets...
Just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in
The streets stay flooded with crack rocks and Mac shots
The scenery's money, guerrillas in the back drop
The livest'll pop, the weakest get chopped where they stand
Singing the judge's name, dropped in the stand
Drug money kills, blood on my bills, mud on my Nikes
Only buying with the couple that I trust with my life
Twenty four sev' ducking the feds, infrared wtih lead
Gamble with off track betting instead
In my hood anybody can get it, and everybody want it
Cutthroat executives, the corners, the office
And the thought is to be boss of all bosses
The cost is ya life, swimming with sharks and orcas
So keep ya guards up, or get scarred up
It's a Cold World, I told you with Allah Just'
The bigger the funds, the bigger the guns that's blazing
It's sick in the slums and niggas are stunting for nathin'


Aiyo, my gun been in more niggas mouths than a whore had dick
With creamy nuts on the side of her jaw
It's Rigatone, nigga, sliding through airports
Riding on niggas like MJ, same day I rocked you, comprende?
Yeah, I'm kinda off cuz my guns was dirty
That last joint that hit you, kid, you made the top thirty
Early, walk with me and strap with a vengeance
More or less Ghostface Killah'll stretch you out like mad words in a sentence
Smell the gas burning (yeah) feel the fire (word)
Real talk, it's not that bullshit from The Wire
It's them disco kids that clap iron
Champion hoods, if ya coke don't freeze, my face is not worth frying
We crack eightballs with pool sticks
Bungee jump off a mountain of bricks
Fuck you up if you slinging those nicks
Toney Starks from the octagon, my ox is on
Snap Matt Hughes' neck with my boxers on






Yo, blow my nose for me, man
Word up, man (fuck them)


Spit in your mouth, piss on your bitch
We them wrist getters, everything real bout this, duke
You fucking with them niggas that's splashed up, slave master's master
Dumb move, blast your slut
We want it all, living in Persia, burn something
Snow White rose, bulldog ershkama
Yo take that, drive that around the corner


Yeah, shit on your crew, nigga, it's Wu
Rap athletes, the trap sheet bigger than you
If you ask me, the Cash Rule
Nigga, eat that pussy, you cat food
I sneeze on the track, get at you
I'm sick in the head, I'm getting some head
If she ain't bout getting some bread, don't get in this bed
Real talk, mami, you gotta bounce


Wild like Indians, Al Capone-ians
Not from Chicago, my gun named Margo
It's only when we in beef, we humble in deep
Might kill four-five niggas, die in my sleep
I argue though, who the best, we hardly know
I came through in the S, wash me, yo
Yo, yo, do that for me, go around that car


Niggas, digging they nose, and digging they ass
When I got chips, can't none of ya'll dig in my bag
I pop shit, my killas is black, I got chicks that got chicks
My real world realer than rap
I'm hot, bitch, material, Meth, beyond lyrical
Wake up every morning eat that Captain Crunch cereal
That's that shit right there


Dick game super, grupa fish, Cris' Krug' lottos
I'mma bring it back, one wish
Fresh to death, I'm always, always Rae in the hallways
Yeah, always stay
Ya'll rappers gon' feel my pain, but the other way around
When it's going down, I'm gon' reign
That's my chair, nigga, get the fuck out of it


Yo, fuck you, pay me, if Dirt Dog could see me now
He'd probably say "Fuck you, pay me"
Blowing smoke clouds, shit's crazy
Doorag your dome, get wavy, rap ain't done shit for me lately
It's ass backwards, this game trynna play me
I bet this never happens to Jay-Z
Get money, fuck them haters, real talk


Pay me, play me, weigh he, just the right measurement
This may happen in a day, G
I'mma keep it real, for real G's, niggas is lame
Industry pussies, we can't feel these
Regardless that I'm paid in flossy, rich in the mind
I do this for the nine niggas who forced me
Ya'll niggas is playing me, man




Back with another one, this hip hop shit ain't over
The Wu brought it back I told you
Chef shit is hard
The hip hop critics is dick heads, they'd rather see Shallah in the yard
Writing rhymes that's soft as cotton
We can never ever see that, the nigga flow grows is poppin'
First verse I'll be ready to get clowns
Catch 'em in hallways, the worst look get laid down
And yo, I rhyme for shooters and boosters
Get money churchmen, all those respect my Wu shit
Regardless if you see me on TV
In 3D and HD, I'mma stay safe in Rae beats
This time I'm a bastard swordsman
Who put in that work, real quick then I'm repping to Boston
Don't try to get in my way
Any rapper any herb I'mma blow you like herbs and lick


Fuck a cell phone plan, with a ring I get a hundred dollars
Five dubs in a whip on my way to holler
Yeah I do credits, but not the ones you get in college
My niggas can't afford Benzes, so we rip impalas
Tints on the windows, lookin' like the Ds
Got the dope boys nervous when they see me in the street
Fuck the hollering on wax, you can see me if it's beef
Hollywood will load the gat and put the BBs in his fleece
I'm a preacher with the piece
I used to sell X on the west coast, now I get it cheaper on the east
I've been around the world like Lisa Stansbury
TV with the goosenecks, goosenecks to the cranberry
Got the Clan ready with the 10 Chevy, keep my grams heavy
Slap a bitch ass, doggy style, like my hand's heavy
G up in my swag, tough talk'll get your man buried
Blow the last dragon, part two, nigga, fists of fury


I could care less if you're well know shooters
100 guns, 100 clips, but you still can't move
It's been a while since you heard a nice nigga from BK
Representin' the village, known for lettin' this heat spray
First grip we flipped took like a weekend, 3 days
Whole team runnin' 'round the Ps with AKs
9 different types of drugs, slipping 'em 5 ways
Gettin' rid of a brick in less than five days
I pop your head off, leave your brains on the sidewalk
My 40 cal, a rearrange to your sidetalk?
Where I go, my team, they gonna follow
Top Model hoes, with no game, they gonna swallow
Got a lotta foes, that's why my aim be on hollow
Die before I let you violate, nigga, live by the motto
Pimpin' through lanes, poppin' ?
At this rate, I'm gonna miss it, I might not witness tomorrow


You say you gangsta? Yeah I'm a gangsta
You pop that thang? yeah I pop that thang
Your clip on empty? My clip on empty
Your clique gon bang? Yeah my clique gon bang


Look, I hit a weed spot
Bypass niggas with broke guns and cheap shots
Outlastin' niggas with no punch, y'all eat cock
Get too cocky, the heat cock
You wanna walk a mile in my shoes, you need socks
You need not call out a G, cause he's not
They playin' with a pussy, I'ma show 'em the G spot
This dude's a Meth-head, I'll show him the detox
Look at Johnny with his old ass
I'm still schoolin' the whole class
The kids in the hall, you get no pass
Ice hit the eye like a cold flash
Niggas hopin' I don't spaz
Speak for the have-nots and don't-haves
Fuck it, I'm thorough nigga, fuck their worlds
Meth clutch the mic, bitch niggas clutch their pearls
Tonight, I ain't feelin' no ice stares
If you want it, I'm right here, Staten Island and we don't fight fair


As a young lil' homie, I used to sell crack
I used to run in the front of the building and come out the back
Lil homie on the block with the fly ass gear
Me and my crew used to shop around Union Square
Ay yo, I never knew I would become an MC
Now everybody on the block be amazed at me
Because I rock the mic most definitely
Throw darts and I get fly on you, you know my steez
Buy 25 high?, yo, I stay low key
And if I have to pop something, yo, it's not my fault
I ain't tell y'all niggas try to crack my vault
I'm the new terrorist rapper, the main assault
You ? on your back, elbow a nigga thought
Through Wu-Tang lyrical kung-fu
Death when you enter, all my nigga will hunt you
Peace to the gods
One, two, one, two


Million dollar voice box
It's your choice, Ox
The face Ox cut off
Like tank tops
My motivation is money and mass murdering
While you still provin' you nice in rap tournaments
I be all smooth with the ice and mad burners
And plottin' on takin' your life
Look how I lure them in
Get drunk, smoke ashes up out the urn again
Axe murderin' journalist for the words they writ
Mathematics crafted the beat, called Term to spit
Cause I set fire to shit like a furnace lit
I pack German clips, stash box in the whip
Four door Optimus Prime, Transformer shit
Call the coroner, caskets for half price
Bodies in the trunk, movin' through the Mass Pike
It's all now, cause in Law town
We roll with premature babies
We carry four pounds

Chiba-hawk from New York, Tical Staten Isle
Niggas thought, that they could walk a dog but they caught
A bad situation, cause I'm a sandwich short
Of a picnic, cause you ain't equipped with the sickening
Style, blowing up the spot like ballistic
Missiles, I be comin through like the four-nine-three-eleven
Tearing up the power-u, Meth-Tical
A bad motherfucking buddah monk, what the fuck
Hit your chest, like cardiac arrest, blow the front
Out the frame, hit the pussycat for the pain
Of the dog shit, nobody move run your garments
A rugged vet, terrible like a Champion sweat
Wrap a power in a tec, to wet
A nigga up, with all the dangerous diseases
Sniffling, sneezing, coughing, aching, stuffy head fever
Fucker, I think it's bout time that you suffer
Bobbing on my knob like an all day sucker
Bitch!


Meth Vs. Chef
Meth Vs. Chef (Let's bring this shit)
Meth Vs. Chef (Yeah, one more time!)
Meth Vs. Chef
I blow your fuckin ass to death


I'm goin all out kid no turnbacks
You could try to front, get smoked and that's that
Lyric assassin, dressed in black rugged
Sixteen shots to your mug, from a slug then
I go to war in a concrete jungle, making bundles
Niggas act funny, and fumble
But I relax, count my shells, a lot of heads gotta fly
Niggas stay strapped, armed to die
Time for jet-black Tim boot, flowin
Wha-Su God get him, hit em with the nine troop
No question, cha-cha-BOW in the session
Bloodshot in that direction, cypher
Attack you like chess moves best move
Yo, yeah, yo
The boards, your ass
'Tack, 'tack, 'tack, uh!
Attack the boards like chess moves, best move
At Rae through, comin at your motherfuckin crew
Live direct, yeah you better step
Gunshots ring on the set
Let's jet - motivate, to the gate
With some quick high Rae stay fly, and rob your Isle
Airwaves, yo behave
Now you're a slave with the boots that paved the way




Yah...Lames catch feelings, we catch flights, Ugh, Jet Life, Jet Life
Race cars and weed jars


Uh, I got a style for every bump in your face
Grease ball ass nigga, Pontiac judge, open and shut case
You know, I'm bow tied till I die, though I made an exception for the '69
So quick off the line
Coin double side, no matter what, we heads up
We in the yard, tell your dogs they should be aware of us
We break it off, like an engagement gone bad
I fill your jaccuzi with them groupies make it a bird bath, miss me?
No you didn't bitch, with that bullshit, miss me
Tryna claim Spitta name, tyrna be Ms. Me
All of that, kicks to me, silly rabbit trickery
You only around because my spot is where you wish to be
Hope to catch me sleepin' by being freaky but baby girl
Let me be the first to say it's not that easy
I wasn't born yesterday, nor later on that evening
Just had to get that out the way and make the playin' field even


Michael Knight, Michael Knight, Michael Knight
Michael Knight, Michael Knight, Michael Knight
Michael Knight, ski dooo doo dooo doo


And the view from the rockin' chair improves
But I've yet to see a team fuckin' with the crew
Near fall, I saw it all, wide frame
Everything with wings ain't a plane man
Indo get rolled up like car windows
Avoiding the police man, them car Winslows
The wind blow in change, and I am not mad
Old garbage bag rappers need to find a style fast
Its written all over niggas like a Dapper Dan
Survive rough land, cactus plants growin' in desert sands
Alive I stand, left for dead, though a nigga didn't die
I got highed up so I could autograph the sky




Yeah, Shalah, Louis rich
Definitely dressed down and everybody here know it
Yo, a snow white Aston on the ground with a poet
Louis the kid, who told you to come to the crib
Threw a bag in your lap and told you don't blow the kids
We milled up, actually my flowin' is real tough
Sport these gazelles, faded leather on real rough
Bank account, don't even question
Spent all my money last year buyin' shit investments
Marvelous, gangsta, New York nigga, make me sick
Rather screw honeys who ain't cuffin'
All my life, six black kids stolen right from kick dice
And strip you and slice you
So listen young niggas, I'm a give you some jewels quick
Don't ever rat your friends out, you stand in a pool of shit
Lookin like a crab ass faggot
Sooner or later them boys that was hating on you got the ratchets



 (x2)
If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome


The whole world trippin', listen it's still a cold world
The other day I had to bury my homegirl
Wrong place, caught one in her face
Plus her man's on the run and couldn't come to the wake
For Heaven's sake, you pray God open the gate
In this modern day Sodom, that's their only escape
10 year olds are cold, no, they don't hesitate
2 up a G pack, he chose the whole 8
Catch a 5 to 10 sellin' 5's and 10's
And the police informer was your childhood friend
In the real world, gotta hustle for your dream
Extend your clips, fit the muzzle with the beam
For the love of cream, it's nothin' but routine
Swing on the judge, take a couple for the team
He's the young Capone, he grew up in a drug home
Stranded on the Ave with a blunt and his gun shown


If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome


A live scene theme from a Godfather saga
A Martin Scorsese classic and I'm the author
Drama at the opera, crime story novel
Tuxedo suit and silencer on the nozzle
Meeting place scheduled at the Broadway musical
Bravo, we arrive in bulletproof limo
Shotgun, the underboss of our main source
Of interest, the black widow cocaine empress
A princess rich from her family's inheritance
Now let's talk business, begin by addressin' the bricks
That was missin' in the last shipment
At first, everything nice, everything routine
Jocks lining up the food, we blessed him with the cream
But on this day he wasn't ready and my God sense keen
I noticed that his normal firm handshake shook
It wasn't steady when he squeezed


If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome


He went from prince to a king out of a life of rubbish
Wearin' tailor-made suits, Sky Dwellers and clusters
To perfection, rags to riches, the evil's done influenced
That pushed him off the edge, they said the greed made him do it
You're my right hand, damn, he fucked the trust up
It's ruined, niggas caught him slidin' on his belly
I'm grippin' on my hammer with the silencer twisted
Contemplatin' murder now, I'm 'bout to swerve on my biscuit
But it's my man at the same time, I don't wanna do him
He violated, broke a major code, bar what you stealin' now
It's over, in the falls of Niagara, he was soakin'
With a shell case stuck in his head, they found him floatin'


If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome


Allah let me lay in your arms
Hold me like a newborn
Sing to me the most sweetest song
The exalted, the most benevolent
The knower of all
Keep me safe 'till I return back to your residence
This Earth, my place of birth
As time went through the ages it got worse
Sicknesses, beheadings in Syria
Ebola's killin' my people, it's gettin' scarier
Most foods ain't even real, the chip is here
Deadly fluids bein' released, contracted through air
Dear God, it been a minute since I cried out
Since mama died, I never wild out
We need help like the phone's 'bout to die out
Can you hear me? Can you hear me now?
We need a miracle
Destroy the FDA for holdin' back cures
So they can get paid


If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome




Oh shit! Fuck is my watch at?

Mad bitches walkin' by the fella tryin' to crochet, bitch spell it!
Listen trick, be out, bounce
Blew an ounce off of weed in the bitch face, she pulled out two white owls
"Everybody back the fuck up, move!
Chef, you actin' like a loose cannon, Pah, with you and your dudes"
If my shit come up, cool
Matter of fact, clack-clack-clack-clack, niggas pulled out tools


Yo yo yo yo turn the fuckin' lights off
Pass the illumin' Lord, tell the DJ turn the fuckin' music off
We got announcements, we want y'all to listen clear
We just lose about mansion in here
And yo eh yo if we don't get it back it's gon' be a problem
Then my niggas gon' react and that'll be a problem
Eighty-five thou' gone we got a fuckin' problem
Ain't nobody leavin' alive until we find 'em


Excuse me, Miss, no I ain't havin' it
I smacked him with the four pound, bitch hit the ground
Then I stepped off, dry mouth and shit
Equipped with the dipped courdouroy Bailey's with the cream stitch
Powerhouse biscuits that blow roofs off
Rae watch is missin', you take ya boots off
And take off those chaaaaaiiiiiiinnnns
The fat fuck thought I was playin' so I started sprayin
Chicks hit the floor, bottles broke
The owner slid through beefin', duke threw the toast to his throat
We brought the noise like we here to promote
My man don't get his shit in four or five minutes yo we're leavin' with the vote
A gangsta's lotto, thirteen bodies and still climbin
Big shotties, bodied when they sniff body
We did our thing too we got to the Envy lobby
Our last four or five shots we see nobody




Eh yo shit got real that night
Power grabbed him, 'Vine smacked him dead in his head
(Oh shit, nigga he got a magnum!)
Yo we all holdin', rollin
Grab a nigga, search him if he front, fuck it, blow him!
Watchin' niggas foldin
The bartender got a shotgun in his hand
Let off, the wheelchair nigga got up and ran
Surround the Don, full body armor automatically on
The faggots passed off the watch and gone
(yo y'all niggas ain't searchin' shit!)
Yo where the big mouth at? Niggas step up
Matter of fact nigga, lie the fuck up
Nigga tried to swing on G's but he a gentleman
Son, he dropped the dead arm but failed to see it
Two shot G's pealed his meat {*starts to fade out*}
Let's see, niggas tried to front like my niggas is weak
Corey pulled the truck up, C-4ed this bitch, blew it the fuck up!
Niggas'll use and niggas'll die in this mothafucka! {*explosion*}




Yeah; Majestic, marvelous, mind over matter more
My murderous militant mutilate millions
Monsters with the most masculine muscle
Maxing in a major way, munching making more moves maintainin


Multimillion dollar mansions manufactured  mud
Through this metropolis
Millimeters are met with the mufflers
My method is meditative musical medicine
With sergeant mentality mechanisms


Im medicated materials methane meet the master massive
Yall monkeys no match, make a mistake and get mauled by this mamba
Movin with the mobsters of Molotov
When I mingle in a midnight, moments are muggy


Mossberg, mind ya motion
Get molded in the morgue
Your mouth is muted, mockin my music
Got your wife mutilized, bank account minimized
The most malicious, membered for meltin mics be my mission


We millimeter speakers, M&N, back to back rap, relax
You featherweight cats can catch this
P.U.R.E one electric, we fine like coke that stretch quick
So aggressive, we got now, fuck who the next is


Narcotics, narcos, negotiate this nice diss
Nah, never thats a negative, its nonnegotiable
Nemesis they need to fill the Nas
Nonchalant narrators
Navigatin niggas are nauseous, bro
Because they numerals are nathin, none, nada
Nefertiti women neutralizing our nectar, they so naughty
Advise yall nerves to be neutral, all of that nonsense
Should kick us not no wedding living off the land with no mans
Nah, level nostalgic, we notable, notice the nozzles
These nuclear nose brothers are nonsensical
Nuisance is not a necessity
We necessary, we the new nickel mans so just ask Nancy
Nominated and so notorious
Get ya neck broke for ya numbnut
Negligence your life is numbered
Highly respected, ninety-nine attributes
Now you know whos recognized as the Nobles
Peace to Nova Scotia


We millimeter speakers, M&N, back to back rap, relax
You featherweight cats can catch this
P.U.R.E one electric, we fine like coke that stretch quick
So aggressive, we got now
Fuck who the next is




Yo, legend man, whats the prognosis, great minded?

So yo, you go around the corner
You got nourishment over there, waiting for you, man
The other dude, youknowhatimsayin
Tell U Bar Allah, I said, whats good
Who was up in the spot last night


Word to the gold Panameras and to the wood grain in my Lambo
I go the extra mile, my flow scaffolds
Crew cuts, the older niggas, the game rumors, just the same goons
When niggas catch visions for killing capos
Palestinian armor, golden rocket launcher, my aunt
She copped it for me, bought it in Rwanda
See demon schemin', niggas get live in the Beacon
Im shaw to shank shit up like Morgan Freeman
Pussy getting rapper, rich nigga, one-on-one rents niggas
And incidents, my fingerprints been tore up
We sell love slingin' like Siemens, the snort-able Beemers
They love callin' niggas names out, you screamin'
Feds try to trap us and plus tap us, niggasll grab us
Throw you in the rassle, yo, clap ups
Catch me at the Stephen King mansion
With four of my Branson niggas
With me, me and Britney, a dancer
Know your shit authentic by the way your hat fit on you, with it
Im like the Blair Witch nigga in the rented
Curtains in the five-seven, chunky and short
Baggin' dope up in the backseat, your package's walk
Holdin' my girl wedding ring, she Medellin
Name is Beretta King, live in Alpharetta and she never leave me
Flow freely this is all graffiti, the cloth we cut from
Is straight from a rich nigga, greedy


Yo, Scarface gangstas, criminal niggas up in the trenches
Army coats on, playing the benches
Getting paper, sly, thats the motto, intelligent goons
Inside a hundred thousand dollar whip, follow


It's the Vacheron Don! Su Wu-Tang!
Still gritty, leave the pretty to the females
The watch mother pearl with the seashells
Pick of the litter, have this nigga picking paper up
Twitter thug, Im the timeline strangler
Get em up, banging dangerous as angel dust
Cuban Linx smokin' stink in the Brinks trunk
I run with killas who snort powder, extort cowards
Ankle monitors under garments, so fuck showers
I give a fuck what you talking bout
Mob meetings, we them only niggas walking out
Sparkin' purple once a nigga done spaghetti slurpin'
Fly away in my new, Scaglietti surfin'




Yo, we in the back roasting marshmallows
Bottles of Krug
The dialogue is the big chain niggas is rude
Law library scholars, potatoes over the thirty-eights
With bald-heads, all live wires
Eleven homes, six trust funds, came home from doing a dime
We just left Uns, straight up
And we standing over the stoves, in denim Gibaurds
Brought a Dairy Queen to Queens right next to Lowes
IMAX Theatres
Astoria Waldorf
Philip Drummond suite, pretty young thing suckin' my balls off
Bubble baths, hash, zooted up, eyes closed
Silk drawers, fronting in my key-lime pie Wallo's
And I still got a half a ki indeed, Frank Lucas shit
Hid it in coffins, flying over seas
And if you ever try to ruin my knight
Ima make sure my best pawn put like three in your kite
Shot caller, laying in big lofts
Rock of Gibraltar, my pinky joint, killing like Orca
Daytime hawker, a nasty street author
Me, Rae and Rick, uzid out in the porches
Case we gotta Warner bro, like Malcolm-Jamal
Ima Falcon, Seven Mike Vick with the ball
Cause I can hut-one, hut-two, disrespect

Aint a muthafuckin' crew we cant run through




Army shit, nigga
Camouflage, gorilla shit, nigga
You know what it is, man
Yo, Lex, talk, yeah
Where ya man at
Lets go
Stay together, my nigga




Twas the night before twistmas
And all through the house
We had guns and money around
Layin' on the couch
Was dressed with black jewelry this time
Mmmmmm, c'mon


Everybody want me, I created thieves
Why I'm almost as important as the air you breathe
I been through hard times, when it wasn't enough for me
Stick with me, kid, have you livin' in luxury
I'm the reason niggas sellin' drugs to fiends
I'm the reason Mr. Simpson got off clean
I'm the reason some parents gotta bury they kids
And I'm the reason why your cousin on the run from feds
I've been through customs, borders
I've been handled by authorities
Drove people crazy when they couldn't see more of me
I've been saved, I've been buried alive
Say my name enough and any nigga testify
Who you think made that whore sell her ass that time
All by myself, I created black on black crime
I'm America's most, I'm tadded up with Ghost
Even my hand got big, from net to gross
I'm emotionless, yet I breed jealousy and envy
People kill for me or die to defend me
But in the end am I really worth it, son
Rich people make me work for them
And poor people work for me
Who am I? Nigga I'm money
Who am I? Nigga I'm money


See the gun wound, went down for you
Who ran up in the house, duke
Caught one from here and for who?
When niggas was ready to murder me
You stayed up in the crib, like a bitch
Lookin' ill, and it's irkin' me (for who?)
I got stabbed for you
Yo, shot up the ave for you
Just stopped blowin' the cabs for you (for who?)
Chill, some niggas called crabs for you
Holdin' them garbage bags for you
Ill, blowin them hags for you


I'm the root to evil, I don't grow on trees
I'm called by different names, chips, scrilla, cream
And I'm always green whether dirty or clean (Wooooeeee!)
Gettin' ya hands on me is the American Dream
I'm more powerful than God, amazingly
Cause when you pray to God nigga, you pray for me
I'm an exchange hand to hand, with heavy weapontry
This one couple fucked on me, and slept on me
Up in the dice games niggas stepped on me
Bet on me, couldn't pay, bled on me
I enslaved populations, and controlled masses
I come in all forms, coins, paper, plastic
Even credit, I.O.U
You work for me nigga, I own you
If you are smart, you make me work for you
All ya life you try and get me and it's hurtin' you




If you had a million of me, what would you do with me yo?
Would you blow me in a month and have nothin' to show
Or would you invest in me and watch me grow
Take me to the streets and flip me from, do' to sto' to do'
I underseen things I wish I hadn't seen
I came between loved ones and families
A nigga kill his old man to get his hands on me
Got secret ensciptions, examine me
Wanna find me, the bank machine is where I be
And showed 'em to a hundred grand, F.D.I.C
I'm more notorious than the B.I.G
I'm so money, who don't wanna be like me

 2x




(Yo yo guzzlin forties, let's get it on fella, no doubt)
The Walla-bee Champ comes back, Iron Man strikes back
(Lou Diamonds, Tony Starks) Raid your whole empire
No doubt!


Rich man, poor man, read the headlines
Niggas getting murdered for spots and bigger dimes
Droughts and drug wars
Living by gun law
Jailcats come home and want to take yours
As a young one, growing up broke me and my peoples
Had to sell coke, I guess we all in the same boat
Think it, plus drinkin that 90-proof
Playin' on the roof sayin'
We need a next man to shoot...




Yo, I know a rich kid, who got hit for three bricks
Showin off his 850 plush, with a nice whip
Young blood guzzlin' fourties hussled in a rain
Old Earth, shootin' dope in her veins
He never had it all, the kid loved basketball
Had a favorite song, "I Miss You" written by Aaron Hall
Now back to the original, neighborhood, criminals
Clocking dollars, by the hour like his digital
Styrofoam silencers, he rolled around with the
Wildest niggas peeling caps known as the Islanders
From Staten, where crazy clips be clappin
Slept in expensive gold spreads, threads made of satin
Labeled as the cow he had crazy beef
Seen him at the flicks, he pulled out on Duke, Hez and Latief
But he fucked up, he shoulda kept it real and went for kill
Cuz if he don't, these niggas with black barrels will
But, shit never calmed down, one day downtown
He dropped an ounce off
Money had slept like a nightgown
He rolled up in the Albee Square, relaxed like he lived in there
Two kids was beamin him, them niggas from the movie theatre
One had all Guess on, lookin like he had a vest on
The other Pelle Pelle tucked with a firearm
Movin slow, baseball hats, crazy down low
Word life God, this bookhead nigga gotta go
Oh shit! Bookhead, just bought a 5G head
A King Tut piece about the size of Little Maurice
We got to get him baby, no cousin, count to ten
I'm runnin in my first instance, is they're returning
The time is now, walked in and pulled out
Remember me, the nigga from the UA and you pulled out
Don't move don't even flinch Fix em up
Drop the head, don't want to get blood on the Tut
He burped, I shot him, bitch screamed out I'm robbin him
Had to hit him ten more times make sure I got him
Told the owner lay on the floor, shake the comedy
Granny came out blacked down with a half a shotty
I laughed, grab the King Tut head and the cash
Granny shot my man in the ass and broke mega glass
Damn, had to go out with a blast
I shot my way up out of the Albee fast

Oh shit, what the fuck?
This shit is horrible

Play towards regulate laws with heavyweight broads
Don't jock niggas who floss, money ain't yours
Jealous of yourself, watermelon tellin herself
Rather fuck around with a felon, more love smellin
Fendi bag high-Willie in Jag, gorilla Mag
Blow you out the back, throw your broke ass in the gap
Analyze see it like that, felt you love be it like that
Still, I'm realer than the illest on wax
Rockin brims that hang low, frames sweeter than a mango
Flame actin like a lame though, how your game go
Fine, exercise mind play the train yo
Aiyyo you dead on the chain, now watch my name blow

And I never thought you would hurt me boy
But now I know
That's why you're gonna see me walk so fast
Through the door, uh-huh

I think it's time for us to break up, ba-by
We should of never ever been together
You tried to play me but baby I had enough
So I'll be, movin' up


You are leaving, on the next plane
And movin' on cause things ain't just the same
How could you do that, when Nore lace the smooth track
And I'm the one that gave Stella Her Groove Back
The two mack, you see my peoples playin the cut
We thugged out, you know the ones that, say What What
So don't you, need a thug girl, get with a thug pearl
Shorty say I keep em wet like Waterworld

So call me later y'all I think I'm the C-P-T, or
Polly with Mya, in D.C
Doin Calypso, It's All About Me, so ask Sisqo
And "Don't Let It Go To Your Head," now
N.O.R.E., I'm still good in the bed now
And we can break up, move on and don't make up
The last kiss or none of that, like a running back
Got a little cheeba so what? I got tons of that
Noreaga, you know the underground ThunderCat


Shit be real in here, shit be real in here
Uh-uh, shit be real in here, shit be real in here

Boy I'm movin' on
So far from where you are
Should I let you know the code
Cause you wasn't what you seemed
And now I'm wishin on all the rainbows
That I see
That someday you'll regret what you
Done to me
And I never thought you would hurt me boy
But now I know
That's why you're gonna see me walk so fast
Through the door, uh-huh


I keep it live like a grid wire, you know I ain't a liar
N.O.R.E., Raekwon and Lady Mya
Star collab' it, the wire just grab it
And if you see me with shorty, yo I'm stabbin it


Yo Nor' we used to bump like fly newlyweds, get drunk
Fuck and bump beds, rock dumps together, ice on her hand
Broadway Junction the function, Union Square there
You follow me, for a year before you had hair
Actin like you got me on mack, you wack

Mya blow the track


I'll be movin' on
So far from where you are
Should I let you know the code
Cause you wasn't what you seemed

Boy I'm movin' on
So far from where you are...

Crystal chandeliers looking like satellite dishes from NASA

Shoes forbidden in the crib, especially on my Alaskan polar bear rugs
Pictures with billies and parties out in Ibiza

Limited box of cigars from diplomats in Cubana
Rare art of Basquiat feeding fruit to Madonna
Copacabana, I'mma celebrate til they respect a
Success story with trucks unloading imperial nectar
Too many whips, I built a valet
Hundred thousand dollar drapes
Dancing and swinging like a ballet
I showed you all enough to where this shit's a hassle
I'm sorry, your time is up, niggas -- now get up out my castle




Crack that pineapple open
Vision of break faces, gettin' money lay in the boats
Got big rifles, play the hood, ride Benz cycles
Y'all mens are psycho, Killah Hill 'ciples
More fly generics, money make moves, forget it
We got this locked since nineteen-seven
So many rods and weapons, ain't no more reppin's
Take the shit back, faggot, we hate that
Meet the real, we lock the real, me/him lock the steel
Pop off, pull out, drop them bills
I run with all real killas, all for realers
Nikes on, awesome gorillas
Want more then kill 'em, front war, reveal 'em
I want him stretched out, listen, he lost the buildin'
All fly gangstas, more bankers, hundred wit' us
We ex-dust niggas, don't even touch my drink
Fuck around, get shanked, stabbed, shot and broke
Ya' yolked and he blast-es through you in the faint
All my niggas get paint, yo what's my name?
Lexus Diamond, Ice Water Inc


Huh.. (uh-uh-uh-uh)
Uh! Yeah!
Once again in the motherfuckin' place
Fix yo' motherfuckin' face, nigga
Yeah.. you know how we gets down
Me and this mixo, we so.. we so tight
Lex Diamond sound, and uh
I bees the High Chief, Jamel Arief
Straight from East Medina
And uh.. yo.. yeah!
Yeah.. huh!


They started jammin' in the park, just after dark
Two turntables and their DJ scratchin'
Words seemed to have an attraction when they rhymin'
Hip-hop caused the guns to start sparkin'
Temperature risin'
Drape a nigga up with the ratchet, less talkin'
Caught him on the 'nard, bomb like a G. hard
Explosion rocks the Promenade, I'm God
And he show and provin', 'knowledge how he movin'
Smift as the wisdom, move from my gate in a drunken state
I wrote this degree, adjust ya eyes in the light so you could see
Never fall victim, dictate the fate
Leave the bake for the snake
If he take than I take his head without question
In the one to fourteen check the Justice lesson
Now uh!


Uh! It's the pineapple Daquiri fuckin' up ya mindstate
Ya heard? (Yeah) Spread the motherfuckin' word
Yo!


I'm from where it's real, niggas peal ya' orange
We want enough bricks that we could build apartments
I. General in the field of marksmen
The Bad Boys wit' me ain't Will or Martin
Feel what I'm droppin', I spit the ill doctrine
Spot him deep in the Killah Hill poppin'
Two feet dug in the dirt, up to the skirt
Spectator on the sideline lovin' the work
And my team ain't ya' average, CREAM we handle it
Fiends seekin' packages, beams and banana clips
Festo! If you wit' me, let's go!
The nymphos love me, X-O, X-O
Boy listen hard, think twice before you get involved
We hold the weight like cons in the prison yard
They call the riot squad, we live and in charge
Y'all non-beleivers get reminded with scars
It's the pineapple, Rebel I. natural
Fine wine hundred proof, spittin' mine at you
(CHUH-PUGH! Nigga!)

Let's get real vulgar and loud in here, uh huh


Come on, peace to my corner
Where niggas'll leave ya head and switch names on ya
And we ain't holdin' blame for ya
Them niggas'll kill, for real
Come on, peace to my corner
Where niggas'll leave ya head and switch names on ya
And we ain't holdin' blame for ya
Them niggas'll kill, for real


Picture me stompin' you out, up on a flyin' train
Ripped Nikes on, hollow through your hollow brain
I suffocate cats, I rape tracks, all of this is late facts
I wished from the stove, it came, yes
Porsche racin' with Scottish pitts
Best fly rum in the world
I got your girl eatin' exotic dick
Anthrax pussy, the minks, whiskey king
Wrote my name on her face, yeah, yeah, kush me
Elevation keep the arm clustery, thousands of guns
We got money too, and we know how to fight someone
But niggas get burned inside of mines
Chopped into a capsule, amass cool, I'm that live
Yeah, shower that nigga down, he pussy
Tryna hang with wolves, yo, you still plain pussy
Don't ever move, we'll detonate
Fuck up your whole plantation in one night to separate


Come on, peace to my corner
Where niggas'll leave ya head and switch names on ya
And we ain't holdin' blame for ya
Them niggas'll kill, forreal
Come on, peace to my corner
Where niggas'll leave ya head and switch names on ya

One for the money, nothin' after that shit
I'm gettin' foreign money, money talks with an accent
Life is a maze, I done ran out of Pac-Men
Really need a crown on my head like a catholic
Never been a bitch and I don't plan on startin'
Blood gang, beat a beat like Pam on Martin
And you wonder why my right hand man stand-offish
'Cause he got that blam blam on point like swordfish
I'm walkin' 'round the mansion on a cordless
Arguin' with a bitch 'bout how I cannot be her boyfriend
And then I told her, "Hold on, let me click over"
It was my homie T, 'bout to bring them bricks over
We 'bout to break 'em down like when hammers hit boulders
If one of us goes down then we keep our lips frozen
Who that nigga with, Blood? Make that nigga spit blood
Bullet ain't got no name but the nigga that it hit does
Come through in my bitch's car, shoot you with my bitch's gun
She asked where I've been, I just had to make a quick run
I'm an NWA, nigga with an AK
That'll put an end to the melee
Smokin' on pounds 'til them shits just deadweight
Ben Franklin straitjacket, my money gon' stay straight
Lil Tunechi


Come on, peace to my corner
Where niggas'll leave ya head and switch names on ya
And we ain't holdin' blame for ya
Them niggas'll kill, forreal
Come on, peace to my corner
Where niggas'll leave ya head and switch names on ya
And we ain't holdin' blame for ya
Them niggas'll kill, forreal


I seen it all, done it all and still doin' it
Who gave you crime action stories, live from the bricks?
Now it's more diamonds, more bread, more bitches, more head
More land to cover and haters get more lead
Monster rap, decorated, general stripes, I'm top rank
Raise your arm up, salute the globe's most realest still
M16 rounds from 16s
Blood money over here, cash rules daily
Flip train, lay it down flat, call it a G language
Keep flamin', sophisticated killers that's rich and famous
For actin' like your bakery bakes stacks
Get your cake snatched, and your pride too
Money can't replace that
Run but you can't hide
The games that you play'll get you viewed by a coroner, coward
This is my corner


Come on, peace to my corner
Where niggas'll leave ya head and switch names on ya
And we ain't holdin' blame for ya
Them niggas'll kill, forreal
Come on, peace to my corner
Where niggas'll leave ya head and switch names on ya
And we ain't holdin' blame for ya
Them niggas'll kill, forreal




Yo
Come here you oven head
Yo what's the word
Dred upstairs
Passing all packs escorted from Kinetta ear
Yo the nigga's name unknown
Kingston, had it sown
Never rocked the combs
His wig was big
Rob robs on the side , little lucky charm
Dred with jars , flooded graveyard
Brown clarks on
Playin feds in the shark bar (Allahu Akbar)
With another dred named Gov
Both diamond jimmed out
Rockin rentals , spittin phlegm out
Sucked his teeth , two fingers pointin down
What up bonna , passing marijuana to Tanya
CEO of Benny-Hanna , He fucked , sent her to Ghana
He's Benz nigga , rocked shorts , beige Tims nigga he real
Took us to Switzerland , dressed us all ill
Smoking ganja , rocked Anacondas , on next border Elantra
Sent it to his mama
Now that's a major move , the nigga love family
Wouldn't hand me no drugs , showed me his jammi
Bulldog Stanley
Flexin on kinal , sit down , do it Chinese style
On graduation day he threw me a thous
He came through , heavy like fuck , suit flammable
Ill pair of gators he copped in Beirut
Had his man wit him , just stare , don't stand wit him
If assassination strike , he gotta make plans wit him
Roll a joint , keep him on point ?Don Troing poing coin?
Freaked it , members like that I wanna join
The next day I heard he got knocked , fucked me all up
We felt it on the block , let the seeds rock
Peep what the nigga got rocked for
Smuggling dust in Rushmore , four more he went to war for
Moral of the storo ,conspiracy smacked mortals
I'm outta here showin love like Zorro




If you wanna live my life
The world is getting more and more trife
It's time to shed some light
That's what I like, that's what I like


Raised fly while we in the midst of getting high
Take a walk through memory lane, watching when all the pain fly
Things that, happen in relationships, dealing with weapon
And men be on the same bullshit
Let's travel, take a walk with me, yo
I'm like the whiskers that be blazing in your transister
Relax, spoil me, I be on the tour shortly
With enough to spread fortune out, lord, you caught me
We analitical thinkers, we crow too with top rankers
Big thick juicy rocks on the finger
Chill, all my niggas who keep it real
Throw your baseball hat down and keep paying your bills




A wiseman spoke on my behalf, til then I enquired the math
Rae exist with God in the half
Lessons, a mouth full of food, sit back
I tell a story for the blocks and the power moves
Shorties claiming that they hustle for a cause, get caught
In the sharp blade of a knife, but older niggas's go
But some shine, that's the best part of they flaws
They need cover, because we trapped inside these Winter Warz
I come to ya'll as Elijah, stars on the crown symbolizes
Planets for a new horizon
It's all peace when you sizing, the next man enterprising
Learn how to move, don't disguise it
The bulk of the brick will be shown, you all alone
All you think about is getting you fly, that's getting you torn
The evil that maps out of my vulture, murder raps'll sculp you
Hip hop selected our culture
One nigga word ain't enough, let's get up and exercise
The mind like a sit up, walk with your chin up
Post that stormy winter, animos'll tear a friend up
Principals make a nigga light dimmer




It's like Babylon, my society, so wild, been a variety
Which make me seek prosperity
Brothers and sisters let's connect, show love and respect
The youngings is watching, put 'em in check, yo
Your life could change in a sec, ambitions, you bet
Today your here, tomorrow, leaving out the projects
Wake up, we all got morals, striving for perfection
It's just a lesson to look forward to, yo






(Aiyo, Hi-Tek, play that tune for me)
Yeah, yo, they wonder why I play my piano
Why I stay low-key, why I'm always in the studio
Heh, that's what I do, you playing with the game
I play my piano... yeah


Is it the love for the money or the love for the game?
Is it the love from the honies or the love for the chains?
Is it because, most of these little niggas is wack?
Or because the game is yelling "Bring that real shit back"?
Is it because of the limelight I'm just trying to be famous?
Is it cuz the game dying and I'm just trying to save it?
Maybe I'm just successful, so much I won't be cool with 'em
Maybe it's because I'm crazy, just in love with my music
Hi-Tek...


They wonder why I play my piano
You can't deny it if it's in you
Get that money, that monero
Wait any longer, it will stress you


Aiyo, flying through to Aspen in Claiborne glasses
Burning a Churchill, a bad bitch dumping the ashes
It's Bailey's on ice with big straws
Mongoloid rocks is gleaming while the twin Glocks stuffed in my drawers
Jadakiss baldy with chicks on me, bricks on me
French/German murder, Swiss Army, you can never snitch on me
I'm too strong, I'm spinning my web, across town
In rough places and black alleys, getting that bread
If I go broke I'll sell slabs of soap
Cheap bags of smoke, told y'all don't fuck with Tone Loc
It's a Staten Island thing, you could ask Alabin
We wilding without that guap we become very violent
Until then, I play the piano
Luciano on the bass, Mariano on the block with the saves
I'mma grind 'til my seeds is grey
Still young when I'm eighty, poppin Cialis and fuck all day (Huh)




Got the hood jumping, Champion sweats
Nike Flight suit, boots on, 'bout to put it in in the 'jects
Streets love killas, brothers with swords
Suede front, sprayed pumps, lobbies where the losses is bought
New shotties for the youngsters
Good trees, sit in the weeds, white T's on looking for Munsters
Everybody punched in, it's lunchtime
Look at the line, yo I moulded this design
See my gunsmiths {*gun cocks*}
We carry two four-five, trooper tight
But got that gun that shoot stupid fire
Bagging up work, I'm back on the Earth
About to make something happen fast, put a stack in my shirt
Yo, all the coverage you could hear
Mobster status, yeah, year of the great ones, a griz bear
Get mines, you know a nigga rip lines
It's part of the character, but other than that yo I'm on bitch time




Yeah, jump up, beat em down, get the step up...

Those crazy boneyard boys is back once again

Verse One: 12 O'Clock

It's nine-six I'ma bang you with some hits
In two-thousand six I got my son makin hits
A nine to five it's a job to survive
F--k the lies and connives and all them company bribes
I'm Family Ties for my seeds I'd die
I want the whole f--kin pie save them slice for eighty-fives
And besides, see I never had a million
Got beefs that got millions and in buy-outs worth billions
Knotty nigga with a plan platinum jam
Found a million fans in the Lexus to the Lands
So whose the cat in the comfy black Ac?
As a matter of fact, I sick/six fingers I'm from fat
My projects be the livest that it gets
Watch me ---- back Tex and do murders in the backsteps
I want that b---h with a Lex, a house out in New Mex
She disrespect, she buys a Rolex
12 O'Clock sells you stock business
Drive in Benzes, see my dog were tremendous
In case I didn't mention
I'm killin your whole startin team and all them n----z on the benches
So please play your distance
I'm givin a sentence that pull more pain than a dentist
Most def, I'm professional
Twenty G's a show, Germany to Tokyo
Show me lies, suck my beach
I got fans in Puerto Rico that love what I throw

Chorus: Raekwon

Introducing these nasty immigrants
Who want to flinch, move on him he got bank like Merill/Lynch
Styles recorded like a porcelain swordsman
So let RaZAh rip across your face, you're frosting

Verse Two: Raekwon the Chef

Push this s--t out like nine months
Rock Swahali and suede fronts, get paid from n----z
Lifestyle, like a knife in a child
Mail the brick out, Israel, mistrial, blowin like fish scale
Wu, dominate s--t majorly, flavorly
Jubilant cats they keep pagin me
Peace what's the signs ock?
Fruit of life like the apricot
Cocktails tossin em at cops on blocks
Park Hillian, drug hillbillies made billions
Get a gun, kidnap, eight nine Jimmyians
Yo, he had about this amount in his Swiss account
Gunnin this out we reminesces on this b---h's house
Back in time, was a bad fiend
Now I flex mad green get cream seven-fifty n----l gleam
Say hi to chocolate t--i f----d lives
Stop and analyze in eighty-five Hawaiian c--e flex three lives
Caesar Halfmoon, pardon my scalp
Buildin and breathin
You front I'll leave your ass bleedin and sweetened

I don't ever talk about the weather
I wear a long coat made of chickadee feathers
Well I squawk loud
When I'm pushing through a rush hour crowd
On the way to your house
And it's a low life, baby
Aristocrats sippin' fine wine
Ain't my perception of a good time
It's what I'm having
Where do I sign sign?
I'll go straight to hell laughing, come on


Since I was fourteen
Repped it hard like I was James Dean
Giving chickadees some wet jeans
When I rolled through I made it my scene
She was a tall lady
Six feet plus and making men crazy
I hollered at her from my blue Mercedes
Now she walk the streets for me daily


I don't ever talk about the weather
I wear a long coat made of chickadee feathers
Well I squawk loud
When I'm pushing through a rush hour crowd
On the way to your house
And it's a low life, baby
Aristocrats sippin' fine wine
Ain't my perception of a good time
It's what I'm having
Where do I sign sign?
I'll go straight to hell laughing, come on


I know it ain't right
Making money off her backside
But you know she ain't no cheap ride
Rockafellas call me late night
She was made for it
So she might as well get laid for it
And I might as well get paid for it
Cuz in the end I'm gonna pay for it


I don't ever talk about the weather
I wear a long coat made of chickadee feathers
Well I squawk loud
When I'm pushing through a rush hour crowd
On the way to your house
And it's a low life, baby
Aristocrats sippin' fine wine
Ain't my perception of a good time
It's what I'm having
Where do I sign sign?
I'll go straight to hell laughing, come on
Where do I sign sign?
I'll go straight to hell laughing, come on
Where do I sign sign?
I'll go straight to hell laughing, come on
Where do I sign sign?
I'll go straight to hell laughing, come on
I don't ever talk about the weather
I wear a long coat made of chickadee feathers
Well I squawk loud
When I'm pushing through a rush hour crowd
On the way to your house
And it's a low life, baby
Aristocrats sippin' fine wine
Ain't my perception of a good time
It's what I'm having
Where do I sign sign?
I'll go straight to hell laughing, come on




Murder you (Check your 30)
Murder you (Check your 30)
Murder you (Check your 30)
Bring the head, leave the body


So much bread in a nigga's shoebox
I might dead you and sleep in new lots
I drop a bag on one of you crab-ass nigga's so fast
I send two boxes out
Yeah, bring the head, leave the body
Leave his trainers in a nigga lobby
Take the fake chains off, send it to his colleagues
Laugh in his shit, pissin up crystal molly's
I rep drug dealers, hug killers
I ran with most of them
Half is in the ocean, nigga
So much gear, go get Oprah, nigga
So what my bitch a Oprah nigga, yo
Yeah, what color ice is all green, karma
Magazines stacked, black bomber
Been all through the world gettin' homage
Diss mines'? We gon' have a big problem




If you wanna hit me, you couldn't
Bullet range, door wooden
Hop out, y'all nigga's is pudding
Why try to leave, the federation
This is all legislation
Will kill you right in front of your seed
Catch me in the trips
Over the stove, giving you tips
I'm fresh outta court, nigga, you hit
Four's on my wrist, it's business
Keeping em close
Like folding ya arms
Don't go against this
The worldwide brawlers, the legends of sevens
Yo, them the real shot callers
Who stay in the home always
Ballin' at 4 in the mornin'
Yo we all in, teach you how to score kin
My killers, all of us we all winning
Fresh designer shit, snatchin' papes
We on different scales, different weights
You just monkey nigga's, meet the apes
Strictly business, gorillas in 50 states






Brother, I think that necklace is causing you too much trouble


My necklace had the whole crowd on some next shit
The guest list full of real niggas that's hectic
The charm piece made my niggas move like calm beasts
Palm beats, two jostling niggas with long reach
Keep your eyes open for them strong on thieves
Out here looking for ice to put in they teeth
Chain glowing shining and I'm ready for beef
Like my nigga 2 Chainz, cappuccino from the east
From the Wu-Tang Clan, my necklace and my heat
Bang bang, different robe every day of the week
2 Angels, dinner plate, fat dollar sign
Universal flag on, nigga, I got shine




I keep my neck frozen, .45 loaded, please don't approach this
Rope is so ferocious, diamonds that shine in oceans
Keep you arm distant from my carats, silly rabbits
Make me get my barrel, spazzed out and cause havoc
Iced out Cubans, exotic stones from Africa
This the real thing, big bling, the chain swing
Try to swipe mines, that's a no no, the God's loco
Jewelry truckin' fancy spend stacks upon Delancey
Exhaust pipes coughing horse kicks
ACP's dress up the flesh, now the crime scene's gorgeous
My links is unbreakable, told y'all on the Purple Tape
40 inches hang from my neck, nigga, I'm wealthy




Why you say that?
It's real, kill a nigga for this shit
Aha, yo relax sis


Dinner plates rings, smothered in 2 pounds of dope
Eric B on the cut when it blings
Scrubbin' chain down in Colgate, double edged bangers
On they hips I wait in the jaw break
The snakes and the violators, Dracula style takers
We got a bunch of gold balls, but we ain't the Lakers
Hey bitches, stay lickin' my necklace
And I ain't even put the dumb bitch in the guest list
That's what you get when you throwin' on Cuban's
Drawers that's made from silk, a robe and a Ruger
Crack heads catchin' a sweet vix on a scooter
Catch me for my chain, it belongs on a shooter
Lucky my shit blow like a horn on a tuba
You might as well do me now cause I will do ya




God-Cipher-Love-Divine in math 79
Bright yellow and dense in its gift and shine
Still the same when exposed to air and water
Like when amongst thieves you  travellin' across the border
The brink of the metal link when in transition remains solid
The message was lost in transmission
That's often in a free elemental form
Nuggets and grains and rocks and things that's norm
Malleable ductile metal on many levels
Get you shot for a Flintstone, killed for a pebble
Lieutenants and Generals move with criminals
The pride for all in line, they hunt for mineral
The scope is on the rope, claws on the table
Brass knuckle, knees buckle, legs unstable
And it's sold by the weight
Shaped into a plate with food on it
The hungry wolves lie in wait




Tu Tin-To. So you're the tigers of Tinan, bastard, you're gonna pay for this, you'll die here. I'll use the tiger strike to kill you all. I'll show you the three different strokes. Forest Tiger! Win Tiger, Winmau Tiger!




This for all them real niggas, man, that just be on some moves
Study their history, know what time it is
Move general, you heard?


Gold jewels aint my thing, kid, Id rather wear none
Them vehicles I fly around I gave to my son
Growing grays, blowing haze, watching A Raisin in the Sun
Young buck buying some Bucks, the suede ones
My life story was right, shorty, cousinsll fight for me
Blood, lets wild out, lets ride for the white, call me
Got older, got bolder, staircase days
Forty ounces, big bags to blaze, wearing capes
Bagging for hours, cooking up, wolves with power
Hooking up, those devoured, weak niggas foul up
No follow-up, then the connect came, we swallow up
Paying more, then we came with short money, pile it up
Rocking them niggas, they rocking us back
Cause every day we thrust back, felt like the workll reverse that
My worst catll blow you in the church, black
The day that we felt got jerked we came to two guns and three bats


Its sad to think
Were not gonna make it


Well break your legs for steak and eggs, the menu is taking regs
Beef patties with cheese, a Widala state at Teds
A money rich getting comrade, who fell in the storm
Bagged him, now we strong as hell and no going backwards
Leather jackets, new Astons, Mosans, crew flashing
Jealousy around the corner, niggas got two castles
Some with coke, some bubble capsules
Some went and sold dope, some came back broke and asking
The lifestyle is real, it can switch in a flash, kid
From living right to living and gone in a splash, kid
Think back to yesterdays tactics, shouldve been an actor
Blessings, then became a rapper


For some ungodly reason
We just wont let it die
I guess neither one of us
Wants to be the first to say goodbye



{*Carl Thomas harmonizing*}


Yeah, damn mom
It's gone be aight, don't worry about it
Knowha'msayin, I'mma just go
I'mma just pack my shit
Peace out, aight
Don't worry about it
I still love you though


I'll never be the same again (I'll never be the same again)
I'll bet you'll never understand (I'll bet you'll never understand)
The things you put me through (Ooooohhhh)
I tried to be a better man (I tried to be a better man)
But you'll never understand, noooooo
Now it's time that I move on (Move on!)


Aiyyo I gave you everything and you still fucked my head up
Children (I'm sorry Ghost) Not now, shut up
Got back off the road, heard you sleepin with fam
The whole hood ran up on me, I was like "Damn!"
So I stepped back, sized the whole situation patiently
Arguments, face up in the air like you hatin me
Ask you one question, was it good?
He have you on the wall like me, was it
Hood?
You probably showed him your sexy faces, how you ride on top
Grabbin the
Sheets, in a deep zone if he hit the spot
I came home on Friday, Saturday I found out
That night I cried with the kids
I was out
And my man, I'mma do him in
And the Lord knows best what I'mma do to him
And you can keep the crib - all I'm sayin is
Let me find out you got men around my kids




It was the beauty that caught me and held my soul hostage
'Member those days had you smellin my boxes
Old Gold up in the hood and Big Dup
We could push through the grimiest streets, then throw it up
Like "That's my nigga!"
Anybody got somethin bad to say, son'll come through and deliver
Brushin off his 88 clocks, y'all can't touch him
I bet a wad on it, y'all can't fuck with him
Semi-shy, and I'm laid back, crystal hats
Heard ya water broke I was like "Phewww" and ran back
I ran back fast, broke my arm in the mix
To find out that bird nigga tappin my shit
It's alright 'do, maybe he came up with the right dough
Bigger dick, I don't know, must have been the best flow
This thing here, ever man in the world goes through
But fuck that, I put alotta money up, I'm hatin!



 2x
It was like ecstasy girl
Found out it was dizzin ya world
Had us livin in a fantasy world
I wish we never broke up girl


Aiyyo you killed me with that
"Who bought this?" I bought that
Knowin damn well in reality you bought jack
You ain't lift one finger, but you claimin what's yours
Runnin all through the house, bugged out, slammin doors
We used to dress like twins - sweats, baby blue Timbs
You even scratched my Benz, let the pigs in
You think that I'm the biggest bird in America?
Catch me on TV, I'm come back, never the...

 2x




Light up, light up, light up
I got this, chill


Ay yo, cooling
Ankle bracelets on in the matrix
High-powered rifle on the block in them spaceships
Meet my girl Pearl, a fiend with a face-lift
Throw me 76 dime, Chef you stay crisp
Ordering steaks at Tads, a young bucket, it's plaid
Got me rimming while I'm bagging up halves
And my Mother was in gangs back then, kinda strange back then
Strictly fair ones, the game got grim
Cousins slanging chiba, uncles is drunk, aunts is wild
Old folks crowd around, sniffing blow in the clouds
I'm going off now, tell me why
I'm selling work in the town now, is it so
I wanna let you know
Cause if it was real you would've been right there
To see the whole team rallied up and going to wear
Just a fly 'partment near Canal, just like Mr. Chow
Chinese gangsters there; they don't give a fuck
Eating duck staring at us, nigga's pulling pistols out
Let em know yo, we know what we wearing wild
Now we friends wow, checking the Benz out
Take the back room in style, you could fuck in there
Yeah sixteen, smelling my piss
More money, yo we warriors so don't get it twisted
This the real yo, tell me why
It started out in the field yo, is it so
I wanna let you know


My testimony is real, a day like that
Never can say goodbye girl
Never can say goodbye yo
Never let you go girl
No no no, no no no, no no no, no no


Ay yo classy, big chains the jewelry was nasty
Real fly, official, no fugazi, fly tissue
Dressed to kill, we Hill, now walk through the mill
Better rock cluttered pockets, can you jump in the wells
Crack business, plus stack business, equals gat business
Cause everybody smell when your mack whistles
Big bear minks and long-johns, links and long bombers
Half-moon Caesars and more ganja
The bars from yesterday
Got me thinking excel through life
Get glow through the bester-years
Tell me why
I'm gonna let you know, is it so






"Never used to matter to you..."


We used to come down in the slab together, we hit the ave together
Them wood grain wheels we grabbed together
Had the same plugs, cooked out of the same kitchen
Hustle with the same thugs, on the same corners pitching
We hit the same clubs, my family and your squad
Bought all the bottles they had, we hit 'em so hard
Fifty G's on Friday night, sixty on the next
Hundred thousand dollar weekend, my nigga, we used to flex
Bad bitches for the sex, best weed for us to blow
Now with me you gotta plex, wanna take it toe to toe
Is it over a ho, over this work, over the dough?
Boy, you in over your head, and don't say I ain't told you so
You never been a soldier, bro, so don't try to front for me, man
Then lifting weights, acting like you He-Man, ain't G, man
Quit showing out, nigga, let's go and keep it true
I guess the shit that we been through ("Never used to matter to you...")


Yo, we puff ounces together, I could of bounced and left you
When they through them shotties under your nephew
You know I stood there, back you down, and stood ground, was part of the plan
I thought it said ("Never used to matter to you...")
You played it like you was the ringleader, you was a queen
Lost your manhood, you're off of the team
Don't ever come back, I'm spitting on you, shitting on you, no more sales
These shells got your name in script, I'm flipping on you
Corner drug nigga with priors, your gun never went off
In jail you was a liar, your wore wires
Stop fronting on the team, you're through, buy a gun, a crew
But overall it never ("Never used to matter to you...")
We hustle for money, you hustle and funny
Gave you that name, hated my fame, you hated my chain
Now the chair turn, this is our view, coward you through
Don't try to say it never ("Never used to matter to you...")
You fucking liar...


"Never used to matter to you..."
"Never used to matter to you..."




What's good scientist? talk to me kid, how's life working?
Keep your money up dead killers murking niggas
I'm strong been through mountains, I'm like Martin, one Spartan
Guaranteed to blow up your start week
My measurements is ordinance, little bit flashy
Nah, I'm lying I'm all cashmere with glasses
Yeah I'm flashy, don't come through fronting this shit
Light a whole big blunt to this shit
We sit around the table here it goes
It's yours, mines, his, hers, what? This what it does
Just keep it in the family, all love
Lets put the plugs together and cake up, build up the buzz
I write for real niggas who down, bring your hound with you
Throw em a jewel with meat on it, now did you
Analyze it like a 27 inch, give me the wrench
So we can throw a niggas some heroin and Jane and Finch


Bitch I'm from the ski mask school house
Where life stay complicated, intoxicated and gooned out
And niggas ain't graduated but they can relate with they tool belt
That 2 for 10 crack stems, needles and spoons out
Ooh I need some paper, ooh my fingers itching
I wish that Santa Claus would put a brick under my tree for Christmas
A new wig for my bitch and two choppers off in my stocking
Baking soda yola'n locking, you cop then drop the deposit
Signed my life right on the dotted line, wrote it in blood
Got my uncle wiping down my tires, sold em a dub
Niggas know I rap for most of my days, I rap with my plug
Before I see my platinum album, I see my day with the judge, fuck it
When I die tell my mama I'm in the mafia
Equadorian chick 'bout to scoop me up from LaGuardia
A party you wanna stop but you can't give up the sport
Little stove pyrex and fork, shouts to East New York, nigga




Uh-huh, what up, son? Yeah
Maintaining, maintaining, you know?
You good, right? Everything proper, still, right?
Of course, come on, man, what's the matter with you, man?
Ain't nothing, I just want us to be on


Tell a friend, it's that symbol again, that W
Coming through, bust a shot on your block, give me a Soo!
Get it right, all my chicks hold ya tits, let's get it in
All my niggas take a toke off this weed, let it begin
Here we go, yo, ya'll already know what it do
Brand new, nigga, back from the slums, it be the Wu
Now throw ya W's up, back from the slums, it be the Wu


You know how to dress a lad, get rocked, hundred bags, black doorags
Ski masks is on, g-rags
Don't try to take pictures, relax, still in the grass
You'll learn respect, burst when I ask
Rhyme master busy, Rizzy on the subject
Love Deck, thug buried, drug vest, snub sets, iller than most
Night time toast, gorillas in boats, three votes
Realers is killa, gangsta feel notes
Hibernation yo, switch up, liver nation, fly information
Vivid vacation, deliberation moments
Move like '91 Romans, cloning everything
Gents only, the rent's on the stove, I'm in Rome
Maxed out, Amex style, my team brand bandits
Make a move and get blown off the planet, baby
Hold that cannon, just understand we got the whole shit
Padlocked down, my niggas won't have it




Aiyo, jumping out of Benz wagons, my family live in the Hill
They call us Bin Ladins, laughing, turbaned up
Faggot niggas get murdered up, these streets is like radio beef
So watch how the kid turn it up
Bulletproof tuxes, knuckle games is clobbering and busters
Eighteen niggas, bringing the ruckus
Flame throwers on our backs and shoulders, the rusty joints still work
The trey eight'll blow one of your dojas
When theres mad heat, he the mad calm, walk around
Gold collect, 36, so before G bomb
My inner strength flowing, I mastered Qi-Gong
Ya'll Planet of the Apes, standing next to King Kong
Forensic file, ultraviolet hype, sky blue Bals
Laying niggas like ceramic tile
I'm like Urlacher, beasting at the top of the pile
Kneeing niggas in the nuts, nigga, damn I'm foul




We blow money, got game, hungry, we pop things
Look for me, grams in my pocket, Chef cook for me
Blue Magic bundles, I'm dope, but on the humble
I'm a good dude, don't short change me, seen as a hood rule
Beer drinking, Cuban Linking, new way of thinking
Got me thinking Meth, break the handcuffs, run out the precinct
This is hard body, hard knocks, if you pushing that hard rock
Then let these niggas go off top
We rock fitted, dropkick it, I lived it and not quit it
I pithed it, my pops sniffed it, need business, I'm not finished
I'm *burns himself* too hot wit it, you bitching, the plot thicken
I'm shitting the Glock, spitting, if nigga don't stop snitching
Just what the block missing, the two-seater wit the top missing
And two divas wit they tops missing
Now that's living to me, I'm what these kids is killing to be
But I don't want my children to be






This is that, Rikers Island, not slipping rap flows
For them box bitten bing monsters, sniffin' that blow
Block covers know the style, triple that dough
Forty cal. for them cock suckers, sittin' back slow
What y'all know about coke pies, give 'em that low
I mouth them before the bowtie resemble cash flow
Rap NY, no lie, my side is back Ghost, so hot
Crooked cops are searching your asshole, it's the drop
That freeze niggas right where they stand for the gwap
Niggas'll play Pac and pop with they man, it don't stop
We up top, but we locked and landing
He roadblock, he flow shots, get Ghost and scram
Gingerbread niggas on the run from feds
Shit is sick, pretty chicks'll put a gun to ya head
Never a vic', either think quick or end up dead
Cuz when we flip, what's left to be said? New York
New York, New York, New York


"New York, New York"
"Number One"
"New York, New York"
"Keep it real" "I get ill"
"New York, New York"
"Number one"
"New York, New York"
"The city" "I gotta get in"


You know the town stupid, this is all authentic ground
You can get poked, grabbed and choked, then shot up, for product
Bank holders stay in the lab, too many dumb niggas is scheming
You can get murked up in the cab
Shout out to niggas that be jerking tags, rollin' in Jags
Good boy leathers, hood boys'll blast you
Niggas that carry ones and hit grass
And love hip hop, the shit that bring money outta ziplocs
Protect your dome, I'm warning you, what harm I do to the kid
I have you on the floor with ya armor loose
Break the raw down and sign truces
Then switch the next muthafuckin' date, fuck all excuses
When you see me it's real, I'm just a natural born hustler
The castle where they wrap you in plastic, duke
So every soldier that's armed, remind your general
It's critical, you might stay a night, if you presentable




Yo, we was raised in the dead arm district
Before guns was called biscuits, Stapleton was on that hood shit
Live from the New York borough, keeping it thorough
Bunch of snakes in the grass, stay creepin' like squirrels
Cuz a snitch gon' crack that nut, don't give a fuck
Did ten hours long and try to wrap us up
He dry snitching, post up in the whip with a fly wisdom
Hopped out to get a dutch, but he left with his wig splitten
We from New York, my city never sleeps (No)
We runnin' with a hundred heats
When beef pop off, we ain't the one to speak
Dressed in all black, driving sixteen hurses
With sixteen niggas, dropping sixteen verses
Big faces, bolgin' outta big green purses
Stuck ya man for his vegi's and his lame ass circus
So I dare niggas act up, y'all niggas act up
Now like cars in reverse, y'all better back up






Aye yo, times is hard, but we get through em
And even though it's crime involved, we had to do 'em
By any means, Malcolm X marks the spot
I went from ridin' bikes to ridin' through in a drop
The road to success for me was real gritty
Wasn't no stress for me, don't feel pity
Life is a bitch and she sure ain't pretty
And I'mma do me anyway, nigga
Cause I'm from New York City


I break bread, ribs, hundred dollar bills
A young prodigy when it come to drug deals
In New York I get blood money
Dirty cash bought my matte black Jeep
I used to skip out on cabs
Went from givin' no dough to given limos to get to shows
Either way I'm driven - the shit shows
Spit flows like boat sick hoes, Yachtmaster Rolex watch above my Mo'
Drinkin' champagne out the bottle
Young Crisco, pop it, hop in, let's politic, ditto
Same niggas sayin' "time to get this money"
They've been the same niggas sayin' that for years, still hungry
New discussion: New York artists wanna be southern
The city's lost, so out-of-towners find themselves frontin'
It was Big, Jay Z, now Troy Ave here after
But Kendrick Lamar's just a weirdo rapper




We went from Uzis to elephant guns
Small pistols on Gynsills - little shorties, cheeba, big forties
Sittin' back in the 'hood - good, nigga, good
Retrievin' every dollar bill, grabbin' my wood
You know we specialists at nighttime
Call us the poisonous pumpers
Who run up on these niggas like Nightline
The arsonists and good vines
That means the wares is amazing - assignment, baby, since '89
Creepin' through hallways, big laundry bags
Four Ks - handle them niggas, now jam niggas
Fuck they gon' do with no CREAM? You might as well be a bum
Cause you could never represent the money team
We smash faces, flash bracelets, that's the basic
Don't get smacked in your mouth with 45 razors
Yeah, the jungle brothers rollin' with all coverage
Get 'em young Troy - What? He fucked with us




You know how I steady rock - New York City bop
Used to slang grainy rock - war on the petty block
Back-to-back cases
Now we drink liquor, drinkin' back-to-back cases
No, we ain't erase this
Spades hand, aces - out of town papers
Luck's all Vegas - herb shit, Avis
I graduated from the street life accordingly
Said my first rhyme on a jail phone, recordedly
I been shot niggas since 14
I've been to war, mean - got guns from Fort Greene
I extorted niggas - I was the re-up man
I gave the orders, nigga - P.A.P.I. gave the orders, nigga
King flow, used to get coke from Domingo
Get up in the old folks' home, he's playin' bingo
He sold it for 10, but I got em for cinco
Safe in the ceiling, the guns under the sink flow




The life and times of a New York Nigga, we very different
Please pardon my aggression, but move from my vision
With that bullshit you spittin', you talkin' my high off
You blowin' my vibe, you forcin' my iron off my belt
I'm forcin' myself to be chill
Listen to them journalists, get yourself killed
They ain't never lived this life, and no near nothin' 'bout it
They hide behind aliases and talk rowdy
From behind a MacBook, fuck a blog, dawg
If I see you in the flesh you'll be shook
Like a martini - I know they tired of me
I know they wish I would die already, but I'm very dope
I'm so cold, you should get your February coat
That NY shit, you niggas got warm hearts
No offense, but I'll tear you apart
No matter which part of the map you reppin', get your weapon





Ayo times is hard
But we get thru em
And even tho its crime involved
We had to do em
By any means
Malcolm x marks the spot
I went from riding bikes to riding through in a drop
The road to success for me
Was real gritty
Wasn't no stress for me
Dont feel pity
Life is a bitch and she sure ain't pretty
But ima do me anyway nigga
Cause im from New York City

I break bread
Ribs

A young prodigy when it come to Drug Deals
In New York i get blood money

New Discussion

Kendrick Lamar jus a weirdo rapper




Caution
If you are turned off by the truth of what's happening on the street today
Turn your attention away
Nigga Lover
The movie they tried to stop
So real, so violent, so brutally honest
That only a few theaters dared to show it
Nigga Lover
Where black and white passions explode
The chase that begins with love
And ends in violence
Not just another black movie
Different than all the rest
See Nigga Lover
The movie they tried to stop




Yo I rose early mornin', spread my wings yawnin'
Vague memory of last night now it's all dawnin'
Look down and see dry blood all on my garment
It stained all my Guess formers, kevlar'd enormous
I hopped up, outta my bed holdin my head
Flashbacks of gun shots shot past my head
I can recall an eight man brawl three men fall
Bullets flew I had to drug my man behind a wall
Left a wet trail, delivered these slugs like air mail
Directly at the cat that made my man blood spill
An eye for an eye you know my science of life
Is you man or mice, thugs or the cowardly type?
I kick that '98 shit for your ears to list
Nigga P way ahead of his time, surpassed kids
(Fuck you kids be doin' yo?)
Kickin' rhymes that's true lies
Let me break 'em down to size minimize they air time
After this you never will go back to that which
Sit back an' write half ass shit
The last official taking out the artificial
Let me relieve you replace that shit with some lethal
Mobb, remember the name it's been along
That nigga's shook to death from the first fuckin song
Fluidly my mind flooded with jewels infinite
The kinda rap bandits in attics stuck on some live shit
Bear witness to this diligent street cat
I carry myself hold myself down in fact
This one dedicated to my niggas on run
Holdin big gats go for your gun
Prepare to crush them we trust none
Man who ain't down with the clan
The Mobb dynasty apparantly you thought I was some other type
Nigga you could fuck with you shit outta luck
Boss I break your compass throw you way off course
We buildin from ground up startin from ground zero
Mafia on da see the name upon the mural
Durable physically fit raps articulate
You get your whole skeleton cracked somethin ridiculous
Still facinated by my ste
Little P wanna be me, huh you no D


One time son you know we be the illest in this
Push the shit back, QBC gat, plottin to move back
The big mouth cat ship'll sink to the bottom
Easily overthrowin niggas, rollin over niggas


Yo crushed krills, dollar bills, swish suit on
Screw on, dry-cell nigga with his loot on
Watch this, thunn Glock less, fiends scopin out my rock shit
Diamond on some H&R Block shit

Word to me thunn, the uniform do mean a lot
I approach lit up cousin sit up matter of fact get up
What, fronts on the bottom face lit up
Yeah where you from I'm from here
You know Brina and Javier, and Little Life doin thirty years
Analyzin this wise guy a look alike first prize guy
Lit up the thai stick (riiiiight!)
Emotionally playin him close like I'm supposed to be
Somethin spoke to me, it was this little nigga pokin me
I heard sirens now turn around about to hit em
Son was p-o nine with the emblem
Grabbed my goose down the walkie-talkie
Foul I'm loose now shot went off knocked the juice down
It ricocheted and hit a GS now here comes EMS, Dunn was leanin near a ZX
Next time shit's parental, God slap fire out yer mental
Jet in a boat with rims demensional



Know why?
Cause live niggas rap this shit
From Rikers Houses to the streets pavement
Word life, kid, I have you hopping the fence
Dodging for life, running the sprint, the Infamous
Live niggas rap this shit
Fake cats get offended, intimidated
Putting up they defense
I have you hopping the fence
Dodging for life, running the sprint, the Infamous




This is that fly shit, ladies and Gentlemen
Durag Dynasty


Champion belt holders, dolo did it
Without a hand out I'd still remain Polo printed
Speakin' of the golden era, God, you know we was part of that
My old flicks is like Abyssinian artifacts
A bunch of warnings we gave you but yet still
You ride with 85ers and actin' like you're out of your mind
That's a Uncle Thomas behavior and furthermore my niggas ain't rollin'
So if you see us then y'all niggas should slide
I roll wit' maniacs, brainiacs, mainly with gats
Aiyo Daddy-O, tell Shallah to meet me in Iraq
I part raw back, they got Gucci dashikis and all that
Right now I'm in the Philippines drunk rocking a straw hat
Be back to the block soon, top noon
Running with top goons, that's the type of shit that I'm talkin' 'bout
The tour is coming soon, for now we in the streets
Eating off land, prepare to go to war with a platoon, nigga


Little brother what's the science? You could come to the yard

We major fly niggas, garments is nothin', press a button
Watch me light somethin', I'm holdin' you back like you good
Grill cheese, egg, sixes waitin' for the sevens, you heard
Word to my mother, this is legend, a star home made barber
Touch the top, leave the edges shredded
Then it's laid out, fresh blow 'caine rhymes is ready
Know you glow, try to stay on point like swords
Don't ever underestimate the competition, this is important
I'm your brother, do it my way, the don way
Yves Saint-Laurent way, gimme your palm, the fire warm, Rae


Aiyo Cotton Club, coco leaf, age of the scared criminal

Cause them boys keep challenging me
(But there's no competition)

Baby just play it straight, Straaaaight

We've been together six months now, (The most perfect days)
You pushed for us to exchange vows, (Baby changed my ways)
I gave my life over to you, (And you turned around)
After all that we've been through, (I was your rebound)
Girl I want you, (All time)
I'll forever love you, (You're mine)
I'm not mad even though I'm sad, (Cause you)
Should give me one more chance


Huh, Huh, Huh-Huh, Huh, Remix, You know the deal yall
Word up, Chef Raekwon let's go
Her ass like Stewbie, Big breasts, Big S
Caught her by the Gucci shop, Stop
Let me holla, Pop my collar
All mine Prada, Everything from skis to the wallet
Paper must pile it, Style in it
Most of mine whyle in it
Shopping store all Bobby Brown in it
Ego, Foul with it, We go, I'll hit it
Now niggas hitting that peditto, Wild wizards


Is this the life you really want, (Constant delusion)
Your time with me was very Fun, (There's no illusion)
But I don't know you anymore
When you walked outside that doooor
You left your happiness
But girl I want you, (All time)
I'll forever love you, (You're mine)
I'm not mad even though I'm sad, (Cause you)
Should give me one more chance




Cause your my one and only
I'm still here feeling lonely
Feeling twisted, Yeaa-aah, Yeaa-aah, Ohhh oh
You're my sunshine
I need you back one more time, Tiii-ime, Tiiiime, Ohh oh






Yeah, yeah you already know man, for real man
From the projects man, all the way to motherfucking
The other side of the world, and shit
You know, 9th Wonder on the track
Big, big boy style, you already know
Louis Rich man


From the Benz to Impalas, a fistful of cash
A bank account, mad thick, quick to hem you, and blast
Instead of maxing in the winter, I'm in Japan with my kin
Hydro spraying a blunt, while Duke do the glasses
It's evident we're comical, quick to
Change up the slang, and bring the beef to you
Just like McDonald's do
Fronting raw, sit behind the bulletproof wall
Count my money, go to war, pull out while fucking my brawd
I'm no industry nigga that suck dick, I only write checks
Get out of line I'm striking the WIC, pull a viper out
Stunting on the beaches, ocean pacific gear
........run the world with my girl it's like sex and the city
Double Aston, rub my dick, fuck with my titties
Yo bitches that love you, that's wonderful, what it do now?
But don't pretend it don't look comfortable


But don't pretend it dont look comfortable




Ay yo back to blowing holes in the microphone pole
I do it easy, with 41 years of my soul
I run around high, and use it like a lullaby
Gone with the wind, with Asics on my feet you can smell the Glock
Cousin stay buzzing, from here to Toronto
Then from there to Buenos Aires, sunk in the congo
All kind of colorful brims,trend big, what it do, yeah
You got money? You welcome to share....keep change
Dwell on recollection, reflections for days
And slanging gats in the buildings for sections
Swim through money like I'm Jewish
Cruising around salt waters, flows don't blow through no sewers
You hungry? Hit me on the hip. You smell me?
Fake niggas sitting on my whip you tell me?
And I got it premiere, stay winning
Respectable real,rugby rap on the low no pretending


Rugby rap on the low, no pretending


Call me Breezy, short for Big Remo
Call up a breezy, tell her to send 3 more
As in kilos, pies....
Auto-pilot im on grind, no sleep mode
Auto signing, no diamond....wood piece on
Dezzy underneath arm, in case I gotta beast on em'
You soft like a ????....Pussy get beat on
Cherry street fairy around the way, I'm legendary nigga
Ask around the ????...
I run with the billas, dealers, killas, lamas, gorillas, pretenders
Fake niggas you ain't get the memo?
Try to form an alliance with the lion out of Carolina
I can speak for em', the jays that I unleash on em'
And they don't capeesh, they hem'd up to see
So I respect the street, it's not a game or for thing shit
Im a star,???with Gods, Im shining..It's hard






You know God, I just been, you know what I'm sayin'?
Doing my regular thing man
So I'mma get back up with you though baby
KnowhatI'msayin? You know you my nigga kid
I'mma always come through for you baby
Yo man, you gotta understand, this shit is real though man
All the time, word
Yo man, that's you man
Yo peace Rae, peace God!
(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead)
What's up baby? God damn, look at you man
Damn God, I got a shit out you man
Man, I done watched you man, since you was a little crumb-snatcher
A little weed-hopper running around here man
Look at you baby, you look good
(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead)
Understand, I watched you go through a lot of trials and tribulations
But you know something, like I used to always tell you baby
A good listener's a good learner
(G-O-D's my reality)
I see you listened VERY well, understand?
(I'm elevating strong and I'm gonna go on to the highest degree)
Your time is coming baby
See sometime, it could be like, a rear view
YouknowhatI'msayin? And people don't know when their blessing comes
But I watch you grow, man you is a very intelligent man
Man, I watched you when I used to sit down and you would
Trick me out my money shootin' dice, niggas is you crazy?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
(G-O-D's my reality)
Crazy you crazy man
Yo Rae, you remember that shit man?
When we used to be down there in the hills and shit man?
(I'm elevating strong I'm gonna go on to the highest degree)
And you'd catch it, from Old Man Freed
He'd be yelling "You little slick ass"
Ha ha ha ha
Talk to me baby, knowhatI'msayin'?
Ha ha ha ha
I've been through all them things, man I'm watchin' you growin'
But remember one thing Rae like I used to tell you
The child you was is making you the man you is today
And if you don't know where you came from baby
You DAMN sure know that you don't know where you going
Can you see what I'm saying?
Know which way you traveling
(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead)
You understand? And follow that destiny, follow the light
And it'll set you free
(Ohh, G-O-D's my reality)
Cause I've watched you baby
You my main man
Yeah
(We're elevating strong and we're going on to the highest degree)


Now that could be the Wu-Tang production
Start to knuckle up and, gun shots start to click the block's duckin'
Could it be, and would it be, that we was babies
Catchin', rabies, niggas seem to act crazy
Day one, in my spot July the tenth
I had a mint, stickin' up Devines hittin' them with nines
I was toxie, from layin' up with roxies all night
This nigga bust a shot, lick my man's wife
It was havoc I contact the Abbot
He shook the shoulder though, then he passed the phat chrome automatic
We goin' to war, you know he had a 2 to 4
He would've did it for me fuck it, let's mosie
Scheming dough, with the P.L.O., wrapped on tight
Sayin' in my mic "Yo we gotta go"
My first impression was to add some lessons
Question, one, what made you even show your gun and blow the session?
He replied and rocked the green eye
And yo, he started, yellin' "Them niggas sellin' two for fives!"
But he's a goner and I got my corner
What, I'm feeding my babies, Cash Rules from morn' to dawning


Yeah, Rae baby
Feedin' my babies, Cash Rules from morn' to dawning
Only God is the son of man
(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead)
I'll say it one time, and be certain that fake God does not exist
(Ohh, G-O-D's my reality)
(I'm elevating strong we're gonna go on to the highest degree)
This is why the universe, has itself balanced the scale
Of divine knowledge, and it was measured by the portion
Of solid knowledge
No man, can judge for another
But each man must weigh all facts and circumstances
And find truth in his own judgment of righteousness
See, the way to evil, balance equality in no man
For no man is good and bad at the same time
Either you good, or you bad

Fly money shit
Niggas always love this type of shit, nigga
You know what Im sayin?
This is for the fuckin skunks out there, nigga
For the fuckin robbers, nigga
And angry niggas, man
For real, man, it dont stop
It never did, nigga, neither
Real rap, nigga
Lets go in, nigga, stop playin with these niggas, man


Yeah, there he go flashing his armor
Army jacket jumping in new fist commas
Project niggas low garments
Tolerance level is low
Dough fly through, yep we on it
Yeah
Scheming in the back of the Benzes
Hundred shot, AK, straight off your lenses
Do it again, screw-face a new face up again
This is how I know its a win
You know we pop rappers down and them broke actors
Tax athletes, yap you at the track meet, black
Keep it a thousand while we slap niggas right in they houses
Lets take the jewelry off you want an ounce, kid
Real niggas know real niggasll blow
At any given second its real, gimme the go
And Imma tear one of yall apart slow
Then scar you with one of these daggars and drag you through the snow


When you take another mans pride or put him outside his character
Got the Mac in his mouth, he yellin
(I have nothing)
(I, I have nothing)
When you dealin with shorts that aint a lot, its just a knot
And your pockets on silt yellin kill something now because
(I have nothing)
(I, I have nothing)


Yeah, its one thirty, Im worthy and dirty
Stepped off the elevator, spray game curvy
Strep throat, less flow herb me
Ready to catch somethin, snatch somethin up, word to Ernie
Yeah, we hillbillies, all of the real willies
Smoke grass, pop mollies, call him a pill-billy
Catch him in the field, do him real silly
Puddle of blood in the mud, thats for frontin, lookin real leery
Grab the flex-and-relax niggas
Automatic tax, not askin, get your jawbone fractured
We can make a mess or do it classy
Im talkin to you, you in the red leather
Niggas wear lead leathers
He felt bad but respected me
Pass the watch and the chain, all respectably
Moseyed off, ran through Schenectady
We aint amongst none of them niggas, all them niggas 


When you take another mans pride or put him outside his character
Got the Mac in his mouth, he yellin
(I have nothing)
(I, I have nothing)

And your pockets on silt yellin kill something now because
(I have nothing)
(I, I have nothing)




A-yo undress your dollar and sleeping with the scholars
In bed with good and bad biz for the quali-
Fication to have gems played on the FM
Sleeping on us is not possible, the metham-
Phetamine flow keep them narcolepts all on go
Green light and no smoking up that green hype
Keep all your thoughts on haze, the backbones for the sound
Well I don't sound back in the days
The Soul's never outdated
Or overexposed or classified as underrated
Though loved by the popular, worthy of the corn
And when the word drops the whole block will warn ya
Told Mac Mill, you 'bout to mack millions
Millions of tweeters follow ya
A million skeezers wanna swallow you whole
Just watch the game and make sure it doesn't swallow your soul


Got some soul like De La do, they say Im new
Its nothing but some deja-vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja-vu, deja-vu
Got some soul like De La do, they say Im new
Its nothing but some deja-vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja-vu, deja-vu


I love snowboarding, getting my dick washed, writing graffiti
Out in Whistler with a goose on a beanie
I'm mack iller, me and Mac Miller, we mack for realla
Don't make me go back and jab your gorilla
Smoke mad kush, always in fresh pairs
Favorite kickin' dunks and fresh airs
Coolin' under the trees with trees
You know the kid 4-5-6, dice rollers
Put your bitch on her knees
Im stuck making paper, yo fuck what you want homie
The streets is hard luck we rolling with sharks only
Wu-Tang, the gang, the clique
Fucking with my favorite white boy will have your head hit a brick
Ayyo, its Pittsburgh Shaolin, we keeping it realer
Just do the knowledge I'm a Pittsburgh Steeler
The hydrogen and oxygen crew
Body count never read, hear what I said
And let it do what it do




Me, Pos and Rae and monopoly
Hit the lottery buying clothes losing closet space
Wu-Tang, De La, Most Dope
So cold, know I'm about blow, my flow's cold
Deliver the rapper sounds and bringing back to the golden age
So amazed how I go in focused, I can flow for days
Overcame a load of pain, smoking on that novocaine
Love and hate tend to fluctuate like its Oprah's weight
Motivated off of loads of hatred, yeah they mad at me
Game, set, match motherfucker, Mac Agassi
You aint in my tax bracket, homie, do work
Rapping as bad as Zack Galifianakis needs two ferns
All I need is some marley lean and the tallest trees
Let my dick show like I'm rocking Tally's jeans
That's something for the homies who won't follow me
Plus I'm on that Wu Tang rocking these Wallabees
I bomb atomically but you already heard that
Wanna be like Killa in a mink coat and fur hat
Pure rap with a new way to be real
Word to Cypress Hill, new rappers dont need deals
Fuck a gun bullet spray, my speech kill
Plus my money tall, just to reach it you need stilts
I was a youngin' coming through on a three-wheel
Now I'm a motherfucking drug, here's a free pill
Go ahead try it out, have you crying loud
X-factor, I'm Simon Cowell, you Private Pal
So kill yourself boy you Vincent D'Onofrio
Full metal jacket bitch lock and load




Aiyo I roll like a Bat Out of Hell, evil acapell's fly
Spitting out of my grill before I hit the sky
With springtime colors, juicy as a Sunkist
Certain broads double Dutch this, they carve it in they wrist
Pillsbury blazes, straightening combs left on the stove
Crumbs in my lady hair, plus yours, the look gold
God, the old chain and ball technique, got these
Vegetable lasagne niggas in they whips, jumping out they seats
18 Bronzeman Part II
We like Dorothy Hamill on ice, we in your hood we might circle
Hats down low in the Range, switch lanes Change my tire, peel out, real loud on the stage yo
I shitted on your hood kid, I shitted on your hood
Got to your burner too late, I'm looking real good
Draped out, shining like a fresh fifty cent piece
"Yo girlfriend, come here, oh shit, you my man's niece"
The gourmet pocket twenty, bombs made of clay
Sexcapades take place, we fucking forty eight shades
Might walk up in your studio, time slap your engineer
Lighter fluid to DAT style, hand me the matches now


Aiyo rainbow Roley on the wrist, now what's this
Niggas bless this, eight and a half, Bally banana twist
E shakes, puffing on lye, feeding the seed's plate
Pulling out old .38s to rob gates
Major wake up, the kid tell tales, make a nigga head wake up
Beats break, the nigga whipped, take off his time
Honolulu status, gladdest, the rich rock cabbage
And dollar vans grands, that nigga mad savage
Stationary Hall of Justice, niggas came clumped out
Just came home, now they bunked out
Money be longer than triple life, till the Sun burn out
That's my word, move it with the burner out
Fidel way of thinking, roll with the Mac bent Ac-10
Most of my team, Five Percent
Check what the live said, rolling with Guess vests pedestrians
Yo, holding my nuts, fucking thousand dollar lesbians

 (x2)
Yo, the Older God put me on to how to rock this
Maintain 360 Lord live prosperous
It only takes a lesson a day, just to analyze life
One time in the respectable mind


Let the shot spark, soon as his pit bull barks
Tire scars from skid marks leaves from jams in school parks
Witness forget his original statement
Even in protection programs there's no escapement
Gunned down, three in town hit king from seven crowns
Spent rounds, catch him while he rhyme in the Zebra Lounge
Wounded, back in the '83 summer heat
Up in 3-0-9 park, rhyming off the drummer's beat
I stalk the city streets demonstrating mic wrecks
All looking stank, I ain't playing with a full deck
And as they nervously stare, I know they scared
They saw the coming of Wu in neon in Times Square
Household name assassin, Killa Bee
Mill to the grain that posess the Wu trilogy
Quick to spot those that bite camoflouge and blend
Those that got styles, they got identical twins
Don't stretch the small thing, copycats are finicky
Without skills, they master the art of mimicry
But I go line for line on the whole page
Your unspotted life on the mic is old age

{*rocket fired, whistles off and explodes, breaking glass*}




Chill, nigga, chill
Get some rest, man, come on, man
Stop playin' wit' me, man
(ohhhhhhh ohhhhhhh ohhhhh)


Lately... I had a love that would ignite all the fire
The desire would leave, for you I'd admire
Lately... you seem all corrupt
I've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers
Drove me to arms of another


Broke the top of goose-down sheets, kissed her on the neck
Real love, hope this ain't the last time we meet
Felt like a King who had a Queen want him
I usually deserve hotels, this one's the gift, slick
On our eye-to-eye contact, body movement, all on the grind
A lady's starin' at me, all in my mind
Sayin', "Boo, I gotta live with you, let's connect and be a bridge"
You stay three forths and I'mma wiz you


Months ago.. you came to me
Told me... love me forever
See.. time has passed.. and lonely days
Have rid his head now.. stormy weather
But out of the rain.. came some delight
I ain't ashamed.. I know that it's right
The way that I'm feelin'..
He touches me.. in ways I like
Says things you won't.. won't day or night
Givin' me healin.. I'm leavin'
Cuz you wanted to know.. that is the reason




The only set back in my state of grace
Is that.. the love is real.. for you and him
In different ways.. and
You're out in space.. yes here on Earth it's fun to play
I wish you were present so my love wouldn't go astray
And he gives what I need
Quenches my thirst when you say "Girl, please"
That's a waste of my breath
It's funny to me.. that you get upset
And I told you quite often
I'mma fill up the space.. did ya think I was talkin'
Out the side of my neck..
You left me alone, what did you expect?




I'm dead in my sleep, she's standin' over the kid
I'm terrified, shorty was deep
I had my hand in her account plus livin' in a lab
Like a Count, I had to go six shorties was pink yo
She had the yolk on me that's when I went broke
We used to flip coke together, get boasted and float
We split real bread, we was large
We had our weddin' in the garage
And then she stopped reviewin' my bars
Hold up




Heeeeeeyyyyyy... yyyyyyyyyeeeeeeaaaaaahhhhh
Forever.. ohhhhhhh bbbbaaaaaaabbbbbbbbyyy
Ohhhhhhh yyyyyooooouuuuuu yyyyyyyyyyoooooooouuuuu





 x4
One of these days and you won't be long


I'm from the home where the buffalo roam
And niggas don't give a flyin' fuck
Talk with signs up, walk with the iron tucked
Leave your eyes wide shut
Money bag's on the table, gots to get my cut
Rebel I city slicker, pick up a pretty sister
Dig her out on the table, bent off the Rmy liquor
Head splitter, deliver so cold I send shivers
From many figures, battle the world or any nigga
I'm uptown saturday night like Bill Cos'
Got weed in the jars with vanilla cigars
On the strip, eyeballin' the chicks, all in the mix
Gassed off of my shit, vibratin' the whip

 x2


Yo I'm sicker than the V12 X5
With cracks in the Rolly jumper all we do is Drink fuckin' Drive
Real niggas raise up, Mommy get your feet off the table
The cable luck bare, my man got me one on his leckle
It's nothin' for me to get up with you, guts with you
Blow off them matches and sit up with you
Aiyo the streets, what is gettin' more crazy?
Stressin' me nothin', investin' the leathers, we all into things blazin'
Slingin' coke is just a normal habit, rappers we wear
Straddlers with cannons and hatchets gettin' cheers
Yatzis are fresh off the block, block squeezin', it's real
If we get real, put pop, poppin' at your blocks equal
Take these niggas and throw 'em in lakes, it's business
Rake these niggas on the mic, display your ninjas
Nines crowns verses your nine towns
Run up with nine 9's, brown down, get to lyin' you down

 x2


I come from the slums, I ain't no dummy
My testiment talk, represent money
This Verbal Intercourse, fueled by exhaust
The bread winner, head spinner, coldest with the force
No remorse, endorse the rap artist
So flamboyant cos I pimp slap the hardest
Ever since the triumph we've been missin' them soldiers
We came tonight, boy the mission is cobra, full exploder
Bulldose through the rubbish, I'm in too deep boy
I just gotta love this, they call we too sweet
One of the nine brothers, I'm so unique
Every line that smother, the situation's grim
It's bloody sin cos every time I want out they pull me back in
I see my reflection in the chrome mac 10
Ask the passer who's faster with the pen
Then pull it, nine hollows, amorettos
That's how I like it, sweat on my wine bottles
The automobiles with them shiny assed hubs
The endo pull, with the bathtub club, my angel's in the mud
Veteran smile, that's gangsta shit, that American style
Dig it, prick or prey
I'm quick to slay with the rectifier shit, caught by the ricochet nigga

"I got to know"

 x2

"I got to know"




I know you'll say one thing, I know you'll say one thing
And then do something else, and then do something else


Ok, oh, no, say it ain't so
Niggas suppose to be moving like cheese, but they don't
Rapping to the D's, so D's can out rush folks
Industry like fleas from east to the west coast
Overseas, I thought they had the best hope, but over there
It's more dangerous, they snitching in foreign languages
I gotta throw on my hater vision
People giving up aliases, and cops pay to listen
Wait, before I finish, let me mention ("one thing")
They need to promise death to you snitches
Ain't do it, but you telling on them lying ass nigga
Don't want no trouble, you Bubbles from The Wire ass nigga
Trying to gain wealth, but scared to do it yourself
Ya'll not grinding, ya'll a bunch of tired ass niggas
Gotta watch it cuz that cool ass nigga, with the jammy
Might turn out to be a, Sammy the Bull, ass nigga, yeah


(Snitch niggas) I know you'll say one thing
(Bitch niggas) I know you'll say one thing
(Turncoats) And then do something else
(You know what's even worse) And then do something else
(Snake niggas) I know you'll say one thing
(Rat niggas) I know you'll say one thing
(Make me get the strap) And then do something else
(Cock the hammer back) And then do something else


Your man said he'll rise to the occassion, ride to the death
You smoking on haze, chopping dimes in the basement
It's all good til the cops raided
Now he signing statements, point your fingers when he put to the test
Yes, niggas say they riders but they fly just
You hiding in the boys, grab your man, he like "come out, they got us"
Any job appointment, people liars, misguiding us
How they say they gon' hire us and deny us
Mob peer pressure makes busters wear wires ("one thing")
That's destined, we catch ya, we'll wet cha
See the one king of pressure with the chill necklace
Screaming that it cost 10, when it only cost a thousand
I'm wilding, cuz I be on some shit with 'em too
I don't lie very much, but I'll admit when I do
I left the crib, told my girl, I'll be right back
I wind up, on the A.C., when Max, he text my jack, and said




Keep snitching on your man, you gon' fry in the pan
Lie in a pot of shit, niggas gon' try you again
You never get nothing, niggas might fuck your button
Catch you on tear, queered up, bout to get cutting
So many niggas lie, that yo, it's only obliged
I tip my hat to real niggas, light a bark and live fly
And if you real nigga, we see it, Zenith style, hold the fort, killa
Gangstas play it all the way out
Or whether locked in a cell or in the hole in the max
Never snitch on your friends, so don't be holding no cracks
You ain't built for it, then move, float on, before you get your vote on
Telling on niggas ain't cool
I wish niggas like you death, last breath
Let a bullet fly, through your dome, come out of your neck
And then you see how it be, ratting on niggas, yapping on niggas
And every time I get a chance, I'm slapping niggas, what?

Cover Art:





Maxing on a fly note, real nigga's appear
We honor those gangstas who ain't here
Legends was born, Apollo classics, young niggas with ones
The hype ratchets, New Balance and Bill Blassie
Roof top nights, the booth, coked down
Air Force on since twenty two
Live niggas try to rhyme, but died
Off the strength of the name, on wack cocaine, niggas is high
Let the beat journey, we could all see clearly
Tweak through the earlobe, with peak of this shit, we seen years go
High times rhyming, so divine, lines that taste like spring water
Shorty dope like a nine
Poison shot the lungs of young
Went through the barrel of sparrow, one who ain't hawk through the slum
Bums had no where, train style, one chain out
Mission was dust, a foam blew my brains out


Who would've thought it was me?
Who would've thought it was you?
Just vibe, just watch you ride it, ride it




Ayo
Teflon king
A scientist at ringing
Buddha trooper jumped out the Uber
Eating grouper
Party with bitches and cougars
Peter Lugers, thats my spot
Sixty dollar shots, Im high off the hookahs
Play the backseat and front
Come through the Rucker with two fuckers
Shawty in blonde streaks, my homie we on peace
Just here coolin, everyday movement
Hit the booth, classics for niggas that dont know what they doin
To the dead, toast to it
Pop toast to it
Drink Ballentine, Ls, I knew it
Sippin Lances in the mansions
Hundreds of chances to win
Drug game is ruptured now drim 
Now drink some Jim or some Jack
Black weed in a black V
Most of my team react, champ
Keep shinin stay powerful, par
Me and digital yall
Now fuck that peep the visuals, God


Every time you come around
I feel my world starts turning topsy-turvy
And I just cant fight the spin
Baby, wont you listen to this love
Whose hearts been missing and dont hurt me
Cause Im falling your way again

Am I weak
Well, sometimes I just cant hardly speak
That I have to pinch myself to be sure
That this love is more than I can endure
Sweet thing, youve got me signing

Ooo la-la-la
Its the way that you feel when you know its real
Ooo la-la-la
Its the warm thats inside when youre satisfied

Ooo la-la-la
Its a dream that lasts forever
Ooo la-la-la
Lets stay together, oh

I can see it there
That look upon your face is saying loves in making...




All the brothers from Brooklyn, will you raise your hand?
Thank you...
All the brothers from Manhattan, will you raise your hand?
(Uh, uh)
All the brothers from the Bronx, will you raise your hand? (Yeah, a Universal fam)
All the brothers from Queens, will you raise your hand?
(oh.. NGE)
All the brothers from Staten Island, will you raise your hand?
(Uh, ok)
All the brothers from Westchester, will you raise your hand?


Yo, check me out, General Monk-Monk style
Run devils across the desert, two thousand, 200 miles
And make 'em walk every step of the way
Strip 'em down, take everything away
Send 'em to the mountainous caves
Two thousand years of lonely stage
Musa slept in the ring of fire
Bringing knowledge of how to steal & be a liar
He tried to be a civilizer, thirty three & one third degrees
Wiser, we taught him how to build a home
And how to live a respectable life
And how to master the original man
Which was the plan of the father as a boy
Now six years old, playing with steel
He saw opposites attract and that everything's real
And if you put your mind to it, by the force of your will
The thoughts manifest to be able to kill
I'm just glad we to the point, that we able to build
If we could only stay able, maybe we will

 (x2)
Original man is first
I wanna say peace to the Gods & the Earths
My universal fam, living out the universal plan
Aiyo, tell 'em who I am (G-O-D)


We at the mosque prayin', nickel bags of black
Foto stacks, it's ganja season
Yeah, now, what up, my dude 'lax
Yo, blowin' coffins, keep bagging
We gon' show the government it ain't about blacks
It's only bout stacks
Furnish labs, ballin' crabs, Houston Oiler mask
Reeboks, tennis yellow, fellow goin' mad
The game is stupid, these teams, they keep sneechin' yo
What's the reason? Too much pussy, to get records to rag, yo
I'm one of the rap's boldest, fold-smith
Paper cut in my hand, I got eleven fingerprints, hold that
Back to the filty ugly, Bugsy, rugby thugs
With no love, slugs, silver ones throw these
Split niggas temples, forget, the shit's freshly squeezed
Roll that Nestle, the vet's seen in rentals
Fly language, lick the sawed-off and spray you
Aiyo, Allah is one, I'm done, no playin', nigga

 (x2)
Original man is first
I wanna say peace to the Gods & the Earths
My universal fam, living out the universal plan
Aiyo, tell 'em who I am (G-O-D)


Yes, last Sunday of the month, so to Harlem we went
No clubbin', to Parliaments and Harriett Tubman
Peace to the Gods, peace to the Earths
Peace to the Seeds, peace to the Birth
Of the Nation of the Five Percent, rap sent
Intelligent brothers, to represent
Allah Justice made the knowledge born
You find the Gods from the jails to the colledge dorms
You got to 'know the ledge' to 'wise the dom'
And understand your culture of freedom
Power Equally with the Gods
So you can build and born your cipher, uh
All your life, you must teach truth
Of the true and living God not a mystery spook
And when you do that, pursue that goal
Which made the student enroll
And only then you'll prosper

 (x2)
Original man is first
I wanna say peace to the Gods & the Earths
My universal fam, living out the universal plan
Aiyo, tell 'em who I am (G-O-D)


I am he who, wrote the Bible and Quran
Who has walked on this planet from Knowledge to Born
Led in the right direction easily I
Offer jewels to those in need of protection
Use mathematics to gain answers to questions
King Kasim God Allah, show forth and prove sun, moon and stars
Raised from the dead by science into the knowledge of God
And now I know what civilization means
And I strive to teach that to these cats
But it seems that, they got a pin stuck in they head or something
Walking around but they're mentally dead
They ask for jewels and I give 'em bread
But some digest that food for thought that they were fed
My wisdom bears fruit Arm, Leg, Leg, Arm, Head
Supreme Being Blackman, the Dred
I... shared equality with Jamar
Eyes red, bloodfire y'all! All hail the Ghetto Messiah
Truth bringer in the midst of these snakes
I... make Knowledge Born going through whatever it takes
Whether I build or destroy, I can cause earthquakes
Adding on to the positive, shining light
As this earth rotates and rotates and rotates




No matter how hard the times may seem
Don't give up our plans
Don't give up our dreams
No broken bridges can turn us around
Cause what we're searching for
Will soon be found


Hey yo listen here shortcake Camay glow
You know we both make angels when we lay in the snow
Heat the house with the oven when the chips got low
Because Tony can't be out there pushing that blow
We made plans and dreams, not grands and schemes
I want to search for the meaning of love, see what it means
Because we hustle so hard, cross so many bridges
Made babies, took trips to the mall for family pictures
And our souls is magnetic, we the meaning of destiny
Be that banker of trust that looks to invest in me
Together, to get her, means for me to get you
We back, reunite like the Wu
See we soulmates, we melt like cookies and cream
And I fiend for the days and the nights to sex my queen
So no matter how hard it seems, dreams come true
Keep Allah in the heart, hugs and kisses
Tony Starks




Still applying the pain
The purple frying my brain, this woman crying again
She tired of fighting, my feelings likely the same
Thats what happens when you wife them they try and tighten the chain
See, she in the right so I put her right in her lane
I'm all night with the pipe I can feel her biting my chain
She got her own I ain't got to buy her a thing
I be burning up the sheets every time I'm lighting the Jane
We go together like Martin and Gina
But she get uptight want to fight like Ike and Tina
So love her or leave her alone like I don't need her though
A minute later I'm back like I ain't mean it yo
We break up just to make up
She fly without the makeup
Together we upgrade to A+
So all this bickering ain't us, we bigger than that
You only cool when I'm digging your back
Now fall back baby




Shorty with the flavor like Breyers
Real sweet with your thick legs
Look like you drink eggs, you lying
Now you met a Teflon don
Stay high, Levi's on
YSL frames no games
I'm into cash man, getting this paper
Buying up acres
Ride around and yo fuck with my neighbours
Pocket full of hundreds and weed
Light the Philly cigar up
And go dolo, ride through SoHo
Ya that little baby in the back
That's the sound of sweet life
A sweet wiz will make you a sweet knight
Chill with the pawns, we on
Because life is a chess board
You better have your sword and vest on
Never hate your enemies because it affects judgement
They only hate it if they know you getting hella cheese
That's what it is, what it do for you?
Don't let the truth bore you
Word up, don't let the youth spoil






It's like... real niggas blow off a fucking head
Ya'll niggas don't know provides, this the real story


Six degrees all the way to the black Lee's, the mac squeeze
Catch you in the open, click-clack, pass the keys, homey
Moving through the town, we there, out of towners get the stare down
Clap you for your blue Nike air's
You a wild comrade, well I'm a wilder one
We've been pumping crack since nine, I run foul with a pile of sons
Moving through the city getting thousands
Digging them wallets, slide in to Olive Garden, wilding
Fourty cal's and eagles, buying teeth, gleamy on the set
Fly to Union Square, we legal, pussy niggas jet
The old code better blow to the death, get ya niggas out the yard
No behind bars, we buying niggas jets
It's just a movement that came right out of a blueprint
Two bents, this is how real we gotta roll, think Cuban hit
This is how a general remains, always be a soldier, don't tell
When real niggas die in reign, while we come blow shit now
Moving in them fly roses, it's all old to us, dick, rubbing our noses
I should of bought my momma a plane, matter fact
Two helicopters and a motherfucking chain that stay built
Your son is your man, let him do what he provides for you
Buy you some land, ride for you
Jet to the highest estate, cake out and just bling on it


Yeah, lord, that's what I'm talking bout family
Word up, we need like, fourty more of them, lord
And we gon' just let you get in, youknowhatimsayin?
You know you that nigga, Daddy-O, youknowhatimean?
We just wanna hear more of that street shit, man
Just give me some more, lord, word up, man
I'm faithfull, go 'head, yo, yo, you know I get down for you
Cuban Linx Part 2...




Hug your right hand, jumped off the plane, kissed the white man
A steady act, curly hair, chubby, fly mustache nigga
Money was long, and plush hat, shit cost nine thousand
Picture me in the housing, serving much crack
Cat look at me, I'm real, lobbin' on the field
For real, I shot niggas shakin' their hands, I'm ill
Damn, one of them business man's
I just seen 'em murk a nigga, but he jerked him at the same time
(That's fam.. (Polite: oh shit))


That's fam, one of those Columbians who got money
One of those niggas might try to get up on me
Yo, damn, I need to eat, and I'm a man
I'm a stand up, nigga, I'mma handle when I'm makin' my plan
Pop, I'll take two hundred bricks, hit me
One helicopter had the super bungalo with the van
All ill technology to watch if I ran, he only gave me
Woody gave sixty eight other black mans


Now.. if Pa-Blow would've kept it gangsta
None of this shit would've never happened


Now the DEA was on his ass
Slick Saucony's on, big homey takin' a blast or somethin'
Handsome big niggas around him
Surroundin' him with big glasses on, drinkin' on lances, fam
Most them niggas fastin'
Cuz when he fed niggas after that, pussy and grass
Had made backs, eight labs, his date was Miss Mass-
Achusetts, Cap eatin' fruit, tongue in his ass
You can't fuck with the cartel, you barked at it
Jabbed her and shot her in the back, I can't stand the bird
Word to furs, I need big wizes
He looked at me, "Huh, exactly, Chef go after big bitches"
Frozen burner henchman, flash the great
Lookin' nine on me, rhinestones, no, them shits is dime stones
Hold a million dollar pound, bust something, don't trust nothin'
I'm in shock, starin' it down


Now.. here's where this shit gets crazy!


The killas increase, he fell, but
Maybe a little bit, the Mediene Cartel will fail
Diego his horse, with George Young
Yo, will argue over large sales, hittin' Cuba with lumps, yeah
Call them niggas drug barons, eighty billion workers sniff
Gettin' lift ownin' Miami yo
Flips got bigger, makin' more trails
Set it out of nowhere when coppin' a jail, I'm eatin' fresh veal
Pa-Blow, the largest nigga involved
The arsenal will have sixty three hundred murders
Livin' in apartments, wild he violated flight a Bianca
Took two hundred niggas down but two men houndin' him
The fuckin' cockroches posin' the on six million dollars sold
We're eatin' enchilada, goat cheese pasta
Yeah we're drippin' it with more salsa
And then they rushed in, found him on the roof dead in his boxers
But it wasn't him


The story.. oh shit.. mothafucka!
Hahahahaha




Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yeah, yo, yeah, yo


Catch me on yo' brochure with beachballs, at least three whores
Head wop Queens know how to work they jaws
They skintone is coffee and milk, mixed up
Ass as big as my boss' wife, stomach ripped up
Spitting liquor in they mouth, cold Moet
Captain Morgan, taking flicks, posing, holding my tech
With cowboy hats and coach bags, they party like rockstars
Bo Gary watches, just chill, they down in the shark bars
And me, gunslinger, clips, cock D
My fashion on, I'm rocking 'em new Rasheeds
I'mma finish ya, go in brother like Mr. Cee
You could find me fucked up like the mice in cheese
Life's a B, Bentley and big bills
Bottles, biscuits, bitches, blunts, bad boys bodying pit bulls
Karate, black belt and I bring booze
To big bar brawls, ball games blasting, fuck 'til my balls blue


We like the black Yankees, old vets who sit in the rest
Thankful, counting up currency and move when it rain, pour
From every bitch that we bless, we hit up, automatic love
The Cuban Link niggas is the realest
My wallet walk, speak to niggas, cops, judges
We put it down, Columbian style, with three killas
Based on money, dummies'll die
It ain't funny, trying to front on mine, we get in ya mommy
Keep cool, nigga, read him the rules, before he bleeding in pools
And fuck my shit up, and I'mma just lose
Paid a lot of paper to live here
American Gangster status, Big Brother, lemme get in ya ear
You know what time it is, crime it is
No matter what rhyme it is
We gon' stay fly, hit lye, rock diamond shits (no question)
Based on a general's fist of fury
Neck, arm, money, all of that's crispy jewelry


Let me show you how I g ride, nina on both sides
Nobody riding shotgun but the four-five
Nigga, if you won't try, I'll give ya something to regret
Throw that mothafucking semi to ya neck
Throw the other black Jimmy to ya chest
If you budge, you get stretched, nothing more, nothing less
Pay respect, I'm a element of Homicide Housing
In other words, bitch, I'm the resident from Homicide Housing
Known for drug dealing, stack thousands
Four hundred grand in the couches, two hundred grand on the houses
At any time I could move up out this
And go and cop some shit up in the moutains


Aiyo, aiyo, you know ya boy stay fresher than produce
Timberland snow boots, collecting more CREAM than a toll booth
I grind daily, Patriotic like Tom Brady
I'm the bomb baby, cuz what I write is beyond crazy
I'm the Don with the teflon armor, good karma, mac palmer
Call me Arab Diesel cuz I'm a track bomber
Roger that, my niggas ain't got it cracked
All we do is dollar stack, get twisted like bottlecaps
While you on the block getting indicted
We island hopping, globe trotting through the friendly skies flying United
There's a party over here and everybody's invited
The headliners is Theodore and everybody's excited


Fuck that, 'bout time we took it back to the block
The task force coming, I got crack in my sock
White Rock on the dinner plate, get cash, shit is hot
Smash whips on the Interstate, we dash on the cops
It's them dudes, drug slingers, 1-6-Ooh
Crime figure, rhyme spitter, his gun spit too
Call 'em Sex Pistols, ravishing, nigga, I'm Rick Rude
And ain't many mothafuckas could fit up in Rick's shoes
Man, listen, ice glisten, they love the life we living
That's a given, like football players love white women
White linen, a tight denim, that ass look right in 'em
Shit, I'm riding 'em, cool as Kahlua's with ice in 'em, shit...

 + (Cappadonna)
Aiyo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo I pass the mic to Cap (Nah, I pass it back)
Never, son, hold that, you the master of the rap attack
So knick knack patty wack (This is how we do it black)
(Slap you with the almanac) Where actual facts is sold as facts


We on our grown man shit like Quincy Jones
Travelling across the world while we smoking the bone
We grinding, y'all niggas know what we do
We get it in with the Murderland, Chi-town too
Hit you up, something nice 'til the death of Yakub
Swagger stuck on ya face like a New Jack tool
Right back at you, yeah me and my dude Toney
We don't fuck with fake contracts and niggas that's phony
Trying to get this money, right homey
And lay back in the Riverside, just chill, relax the domepiece
Link up with a fly dime, brick and a chrome piece
Coming for that gwop, yeah nigga, you got beef

{*skit of Ghostface and co. speaking during concert follows*}






Money ain't a thing if I got it
Mo-mo-money ain't a thing if I got it
Money


Before the money, there was love
But before the money, it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough


Yo, sitting back plotting, jotting information on my nation
Really started from the bottom, boy cotton
But they still planting plantations, we keep buying in
Closed-minded men
Pride is higher than the prices on your Pradas and Balenciagas Balance my saga with the Henny agua
Me and my niggas tryna eat, you pussies empanada
The flow like plenty lava
With just a penny I could multiply my worth
And make you work for me for twenty hours
I swear these niggas love to copy, thanks for listening
The kid ain't been the same
Since Biggie smacked me at my christening
Watch what you dishing and please play it safe
Cause your position on the top is switching right in front your face
Rock you outta space with rhymes, I'm bustin' out
Keep ducking down, got some missiles now, headed for your house
So put the pistols down, got that red dot on your nose
Who booked the clown? I lock jaws like a blue nose
Foes keep your mouth closed or you can see the solar
I got connections that guaranteed to see closed doors
You hear that underground sonar
The way I flows then switch them
The Pros been on a mission
Listen, enter the chamber, get hyperbolic
They raisin' Macs, I raise steaks to keep them brolic
My visions is macrocosmic, pass the chronic
The mastered sonics is light years above your conscious
You're novice, but I got notes that strike nerves
I promise your minds ain't sharp like my swords
So cut the BS, and don't worry where my jeans is
And PS: Your bitch a genius, learned from my penis
I got dreams selling arenas and breaking brackets
Tenants racket, while I'm cracking a Serena
God damn, God bless the heaven that sent you
But now I'm breezing out, baby, cause my rent's due


Shit is really real out here
I said shit is really real out here (It ain't  easy)
Just trying to get a deal out here
(Money ain't a thing if I got it)
Yo, I'm screaming cream, who fucking with the rap supreme?
Joey Bad and Big Preem came to collect the green
I got a dollar and a dream, know what I mean?
And I gotta get my mama off the scene
Yo, I'm screaming cream, who fucking with the rap supreme?
Joey Bad and Big Preem came to collect the green
I got a dollar and a dream, know what I mean?
And I gotta get my mama off the scene (Joey Badass)
Cause cash ruined everything around me
Cash ruined everything around me
Cash ruined everything around me
(Wont sign to no major if no wager) (money ain't a thing)
They say money is the root of all evil
I see money as the route of all people
Cause we all follow paper trails, paper trails
And everybody gotta pay their bills, pay their bills (It ain't easy)
They say money is the root of all evil
I see money as the route of all people
Cause we all follow paper trails, paper trails
And everybody gotta pay their bills, pay their bills
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all


Before the money, there was love
But before the money, it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough




Come here, pussy, prosthetic hard ass nigga
Yo, where them Levi's that I left on ya bunk, nigga?
Don't stand on the side of this bunk no more, man, for real
You see them Rae and Ghost flicks over there, nigga?
Don't touch them shits, nigga
Word up, I'mma break both chains on ya ass, nigga
(Aiyo, Bundy, make sure you crack cell number five, fifteen minutes early)
{Bundy: Yeah, yo, I got you, you want some of these donuts?}
(Nah, I'm good, just make sure you handle my man right, one.)

 (Ghostface Killah)
We up at three mart, blowing, little dust to lift the branch up
The watch he had was Bulgari, golden, Spanish kid let him hold it
He said he hit him with three cartons of menthol, the kid let him roll with it
(The face had snow in it, the bass in his voice
Now he's acting like he ain't rich and po' in it)
Crock pots are steaming, Jasmine rice and Jack Mack
With cornflake batter, it's cold in here
10:45 we lock in, pull out the headphones, jump in the bunk
(The tunes is knocking) Knowing all my goons is clocking
Two C.O.'s is on the cat walk (Yo, Spoons, what's popping?)
Yo, it ain't nothing, baby, you cool?
Yeah, I'm getting that rest, you know that G.E.D. shit with the school?
(True, guess that's what it do
But on the low I got two big gem stars I'm sliding to you
Matter of fact they gon' hide in ya food
All you do is push the grits out the way, then you get up and move
Go to sleep, nigga, go 'head and rest, I'mma finish my count
I'mma set you out, later my dude, one)


Mop wringer magic, mess hall murder's the best
Come through the yard, getting fed lead burgers
Testing anything with bling
Fresh sneakers, we the best teachers
True, watch me move in the cling

 (Ghostface Killah)
Six A.M., the cells unlock
Horn the child, I'm half sleep, yo, hearing the pots
I see the same ice grills, bum niggas talking to me
With coal in they eye, I can't finish my meal
(Under the grits, two pieces of steel)
Then Spoon had left, we got guns though, we trying to chill
Big Will walked in, him and Seville
(With blood in they eyes, early bird like they ready to kill)





 (Raekwon)
I was a fiend, before I was seventeen
I melt the microphone like blowing some evergreen
I saw I that made it from where hip hop was originated
Pieces of the street above on this mob and date it
Cause I grab the mic now I say yes y'all and y'all scrape it
Then I'mma say let's ball, come on, cool
Cuz I'mma get on rap twisted, coming on the speak ???????
??????????, y'all niggas y'all laughs, I spaz on the rhymes I splash
From back to you brother gun then I grab the double pump
And this is the opposite of another come
Cuz I'mma get busy, get dough with my team
I don't need a cigarette know what I mean
I'm raising, hip hop the stage and throw this sound amazing, cuz every one is ???



On veut du gucci, tout jdid, d'autres bouteilles et bouts d'schit
O j'vie a grouille de schmidts, alors il faut qu'on bouge vite

Moi et Raekwon on veut la maille et tout d'suite
The invincible microphone fiend Raekwon
Spread the word, cuz it's on

Ici les jeunes brulent des caisses, et les keufs sont des brutes paisses
Manque de tunes et stress, on devient des hynes d'une pure espce
Ici, tu rgresses, on a faim donc on s'remue les fesses
On nous tue les rves, pour de la maille on a de dures faiblesses
Plus d'rflexes, laissez-moi en paix cuver mes seizes
Fume paisse, dans mon cerveau mon son lance une fuse d'dtresse
Nous on cultive ces blasphmes que les curs dtestent
Pour tre plus prs des vrais quand les censeurs veulent purer mes textes
J'ai tudi les faits, j'ai calcul  puissance dix
Analys les geste pour voir qu'ici la mre patrie sent l'vice
Rien d'nouveau, ma ville s'ennuie pour nous l'avenir s'enfuit
Et mme devant une vitrine rose on voit la vie en gris
La bourse en crise et puis la crasse dans ma tour d'accueil
Ici c'est un peu comme chez toi tu sais c'est chacun pour sa gueule
Ici c'est puche-ca, gun, c'est c'que les yous-voi veulent
On dort d'un il et c'est pour mieux gratter sur toute la feuille

Et dis-moi comment faire du son sans me soucier des gens qu'j'aime
Entre ratures et percussions ici l'ouvrier c'est l'emblme
Des infos en perfusion, j'en ai tri des centaines
Les lections amricaines nous font oublier l'essentiel
Boum, bang c'est Montreuil-Sous gang, du R.A.P sans bootleg
Pour avoir mon gnie sors le whisky et frotte la bouteille
De la musique de fouteng, et jusqu' c'que la foule saigne
Couilles pleines, Swift Guad Raekwon du Wu-Tang



Si quelqu'un veut poster les paroles, qu'il n'hsite pas ! Welcome to RGF !



Fly as the new Five
Live as a white man with black skin
Powerful grimeys, who eat raw like Chinese
Petty cases of coke, boat loads of good ol' dough
We carry back to Medina from Beringia
Feed me a Spanish, half-black, massive back
Thick in the legs, bank account stacked
A nigga with a liable piece of gold
A ranch made of brick white picket fence
Vision my dick
Six horses, four Shar Peis, crib like Holyfield
Build mine slowly, grow G
And a lesson building in manifestin'
Keep the stress off your chest
Then get money like Mexicans
Live as a corner with hard rocks
And big nines and dimes, I'm only part 2
And you a dart
Distinguished gentlemen who love getting dick sucks
Hate comical rap, but kill men for 10 bucks
The palm lady spit on my grave and said, "Chef, you stay paid"
One shell hit you I fell with you
And till then, blow forever
Keep family snakes away -
You got a daughter to treasure
Have twins name one Caesar, female called Anisha
We out to Fiji on Easter
Good bottle of wine
Nine on me dwelling on time
Wearing bally sneaker watch Phillip Stein
Mad grey in my waves, 101-EX
Exelero behind me, dumbstruck meat heads
Thinking of the days I got robbed, not for money
When I mean albums, they couldn't catch it I fouled them
But now more aggressive, checks look special too
Do the knowledge, young boy, we professional




Pit bull fights, niggas is bustin the lights
Undercovers gettin killed for drugs - yo
Fiends is basin, runners is licensed to fight
Young gangstas chase sneakers and snubs - and yo
Elevator's broken, pissy stairwells and shells
Old men gossip with tales, you know?
Police burners with bodies on 'em, bury 'em
Worry for minutes then we fire them (blaow!)
I see firemen, ambulances, narcotic mansions
So melodic, rock chronic, pop tonic scramblin
See all these niggas into gamblin - yo
Just give me square feet, uniquely I'm handlin niggas
Done danced with niggas, plus yo, threw niggas in vans
Left him on trains, his veins got ham in 'em
Take a message, he ran, it was a quarter to four plan
He had me on the floor with my man
We both drugged out, scholars with grams
Tri-colored rocks, follow the hands, full sorrow in plans
Make one false move you blam
Eh yo take the globe right out of ya land
We broke out in Iran


Eh yo it's eight million stories in the city
Niggas actin' shifty, Ice Water back on the grizzly
Brand new handgun that hold about fifty
It's a new boss in town like Mauseberg Mickey
Eight million stories and six is from the hood
A real live hustler up to no good
They needed more yae-yo to ease they habit
They said we fell off, the streets don't believe you faggots!


Where all the wolves live, sub-machine guns and big beamers
Yo circle the crib, you see teamsters that try you again
Little niggas is blind, the nines fly out and slap a few men
That's mine, let up off 'em again
Take seventy more shots, the remedy, Wu through the fence
This bench God, lays in gents
Eh yo pop the head off right under the tents
This is more current events, pay attention
The legend is here, as long as you know him he coffins ya men
What? Bulletproof pimps, big hammers, multiple flips
As long as it's bread, you know you was hit
Eh yo let that stack get rinsed
Play the back, sharp as a fuck, ownin' my own shit
Grown niggas get moments to vent
Give 'em the real Lex Diamond Story, welcome 'em in




Third eye saw it coming, niggas down the block came gunning
Hating, mistaken if they think we was running
Whatever the beef, in the streets, kept it a hundred
Pull the thing, bang it, hit scrams in the stomach
Retreat? Not an option to me, pussy?
Not an option to be, steady popping the heat
My team, move like the regime of the surgeons
Urgently emerging, out of nowhere, guns bursting
Yessir, yessir, we all about it
Extra, extra, read all about it
Us lose to ya'll? Yeah, right, I doubt it
Son came for war, but his life left without it
You know the slang, go against the grain, bad move
Doc Ama, mentally insane, bad news
You know them things split a nigga brains, blood ooze
You lose, cuz we got the Broad Street blues
We take off, the HD's come, the scene taped off
Thugs rather play soft, then pitch my apes off
Niggas play Superman, I shoot ya cape off
Pistol whip 'em, break jaws, scrape ya'll that break north


Yo, what up rude boys? (Rude boys), I know some cool boys
Run around and bust shit down, with train like tool toys
Break bread got the heart pumping
Sit back and blow a bean of the purple, and then I start something
Tell Doc Ama to fart something, cuz we the shit
Told ya'll niggas before, that we was in this bitch
If not the booth, then the block with fifty eights
The stoupe stay warm with a Glock and fifty apes
It's life or death like Notorious Biggie tape
I still perp on foot like a hundred and 20 jakes
I'm money great, my money scrape, my honey good
Transport out of New York, yeah, my honey would
She on the Greyhound, riding with eight pounds
A stop on the bus, walked on by eight clocks
I'm Staten Island, so you know how I talk now
And it ain't no street, that the beef can't walk down


Yessa yessa my lord...
My team thorough soldiers, we call 'em borough tho-diers
They in the south, blessed, mid-west, my niggas holding
Grip counting niggas, mint counting niggas
Every three minutes, we spit, hold it down, my niggas
It's all about hustle, fly cars, jewelry on my niggas necks
If you that live, then touch 'em, yo
I dare a nigga like you, one in your ear, I wipe you
Off the map, you'll get slapped with your white boo
I'm in the fly renter, plus I'm a representer
From Killah Hills, where it's real, this is my agenda
Shallah, what you baking? You got coke up on the stove
Keep it real with me, I'm working on the Purple Tape shit
I got you little nigga, here's a riddle, nigga
Who's large and only ten billion, that's a...


Stop the track, action packed, working names rapper, with rock flavor
Form escape order, ex-druggie, hip hop flavor
Heavy boozer with a short fuse, my temper melts glaciers
Raise you off the floor like George Foreman did Frazier
Carnage to Anastasia, not a major switch
Coming with my government, but still running in your bitch
L-A-B and Beez Mode, peep which way ya'll go
Doc locks shit, then Just say 'heya ho'
We seen this artform fading, hate the way that way
About to leave my mark in this game, and make that dent
Me and my man Rahsaan, kicking shit like Van Damme
Without the ballet training or the gay accent
Bubbling, below the surface, watch when I burst my curses
To speak truth in the booth, that's why it hurts
Beneath this Outfit's, more than flesh, just an idea
And ideas are bulletproof, like Dyverse
When the operative's dispurse, shed a tear
As you watch your weak ass career get hauled off in a herse
Leaping from the frying pan to the fire, claim you trying to teach me
About the leechers and the liars, save it man, you preaching to the choir




I just had to say that right there Rae
I just have to say you my nigga, understand?
It don't get no realer than this, man
Let's slow the fuck down
You gettin' like a hundred worth for real, man


Eh yo thug niggas know the code, lock and load
Hit 'em in the head, watch a nigga brain explode
Yo from Y.O. to Q.B. they bang this shit
Shaolin boys they bang them fifths


Fuckin' cops ain't paid up nothin'
Yo you know we shoot you down, man
Ice Water Inc., yeah! Territory, nigga
Millitainment, Y.O
Yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah eh yo


Eh yo late night, candle light, fiend with a crackpipe
It's only right, feelin' higher than an airplane, right?
I'm tryin' to get this money, right? So I move cautiously
You more frauds, you see? I'mma live bossy
Way out on Fantasy Island with Mr. Roth, B
I gotta play the ghetto, everyday the hood endorse me (Q.B.)
I'm destined for triple, left hand crook and the right hand fury
Will block the shots, that's simple, I dented a tomb for style
A toast to the death of my foes, respect violence, the criminal codes
Hammer smack a nigga out his five senses
Leave him dumb, deaf and blind, I ride on rinses
Interest so tight, strobe lights follow my grace
Bang bullets by the gates, might hollow ya face
Me and Chef smark massive murder, kill 'em!
I scramble anywhere in Shaolin, right in Castalano buildin'


Eh yo real niggas get up, live niggas, what up?
We don't give a fiduck, you faggots'll get hit up
Q.B., what up? Y.O., what up?
Shaolin get up or get yo' ass hit up!


Eh yo I'm a motherfuckin' Nigga Wit an Attitude
Heavy gun play, cock back, niggas is screwed
Stomach wounds make it hard for you to swallow ya food
Throwin' Purple Tape off for me to get in the mood
Sheek Louch, who fuckin' wit' that kid?
I'm sick in the head, they need to make a throwback straight jacket
White tee on, a light G. on
These bitches you wife and the God try pee on
I don't care if it's a gram or brick
I'mma make it sell, get off my dick
Pump or the Desert E., take your pick
Money too long, the case won't stick
D-Block niggas fuck with Rae
Nigga act hard and get hit up in the middle of day
Tough guys and all that but I know that you pay
And I don't give a fuck, niggas better watch what they say




Body specialist, full cam F50 with vans
A pull up, do it to ya mans, yo scrams
If you take niggas ears, niggas ain't really queers
Listen, it's grown men in the town, niggas is their's
Fluck niggas, I cut niggas, stuck niggas
Come up, pluck niggas, pop niggas in chucks, it's business
You in this? We non-shoulder style, son, relentless
They four lettered me Chef, nigga get down
Drop you, piss on you, get this, it's official on you
Yo twist the clips hits, this was on you
I'm just a business head ridin' with visual
Don't force me to put out ya head
One for the money, two for the crime round up
Peep it, all major niggas holdin' they ground, get up
Let's form an army millenia, Ice Water!
From Q.B. to Y.O. with Shaolin, I'm feelin' you




We gon' ride for our team
My niggas'll kill you


For the team, nigga
My niggas kill you, nigga
Y'all niggas want war? Nigga pop up!
Yeah ride for ya motherfuckin' team, nigga
Death before dishonor, you heard me?

Freak nigga that taps shit




Take it off, sho' 'nough kid
Take it off
We gon' take it from the East to the West
To the North to the South
Show y'all what it's about
Don't make me throw no gun in your mouth
You know?
How long is your CREAM? This long?


Eh yo, his belt got karats in it
Swift description, E-320 nigga pitchin
Rock a raw dinosaur chain, hang to his thing
It's like, he pump isolated, still cashin in CREAM
Niggas in the hood hate him, drew a vase of him
Blaze 'em, he actin like Shallah raisin him
This is hydrogen, son ain't live as him
He like Maguyver, chin 4 spies with him
Roll relentless, desert that he hold is a gift wish
Shash the list, give his miss dick
Technique, operation: tech scream
Bet CREAM, them alligators jet like a vet swing
Nigga like Nicolas Cage with the gauge in your braids
2 cannons that'll spray, rockin banana suede
Suck this drunk alcohol dick
Fuck y'all niggas with hits
We bout to shit on y'all shit


Y'all brothas wanna call us out?
Name names, otherwise it'd be the best to shut the fuck up
Get pimp-smacked up, jacked up and macked up
You're scared and froze of bein exposed
I own Harlem, I bone Harlem, call me the mayor
It's my borough, you don't want no problems
I'm on now, you dead pop, all jokes aside
I ride the top, you glide the bottom
Pitfall, 5 foot 9, my dick, balls
Shit y'all, leave flat line to stick your's
We flip off basic and brace it
8 kills, 47 ways to taste it
Never understand what you never been told
You did your book bitin off of my scrolls
We hit man, Colombo, coats and hats to match
Bust off quick, and then, guns go back


I move like Arthur Ash against God
4 raquets, 8 balls and no practice
Every cypher's a heated discussion
The industry was like a beat that needed precussion
I brun the music, shit that make crews flip
State that I'm the illest, this is Q.U. shit
I used to heat-hole, now I'm takin over like the repo'
Bitches that roll, Cee-Lo that'll sniff a kilo'
We went from Frank's and beans to shanks and greens
Now we drive our Navigators to banks in Queen's
Y'all can't fuck around, your words ain't right
Every time I touch the mic, they say "Perb ain't right"
But that's the truth though, d'oh, infact that's it
When they drop this shit, I'm gon' cop that shit
The new star, you want me? I'm at the juice bar
Y'all once hap' niggas, give me 2 stars


I heard what y'all rappin about, but bring your stash out
You shouldn't throw rocks if you livin in glass house
Sneak your weak shit at us, on the low though
Where these cats come from, speakin about po'
He got cash to cop and I'm crashin {*car crashing*}
But half of y'all cats just catchin up to Rae' last year
Got guns in the jungle, call 'em Jurassic
The chrome, the steel, the 20-shot plastic
While y'all niggas cop jars, me and my niggas cop bars
Gettin head from rock stars
We blowin everything apart, I'm smashin the charts
How I see it? (Yo, how you see it?)


Eh yo, what you wanna be when you grow up?
Yo, I wanna be a leader
Slow your speed up and stop tryin to be us
Say somethin always, got a future? Stay out the hallways
And get yourself right, a 100 more ways


Fly like iceberg, nice with verbs, precise words
Bently swerve, hit the curb, jump out, cock back, spit out
Shut your block down, get out, criminal route
Gangsta shit, can't talk now, gun in your mouth
Cream Team killas, cacoon cats like caterpillars
Giant size gorillas, break niggas backs from the skrilla
Scratch, greenback track, Fed's berserk
That's my word, disrespect Recca, get what you deserve
Inferno, melt down mic's, millionaire in my afterlife
Broke bread with Christ on the last night
Apocalypse, sleep with 4-5th, 2 clips
Passport, cellphone with the removable micro-chip
Specialist, 40-karat Sicillian necklace
Matching bracelet, Cream Team crisp the basic




*kung fu fighting*
Yeah, uh, heheheh (That's Shadowboxing!)
Yo...


It's that Blackout, spazzed out, G-String divas
Leave you assed out, passed out, it's cold
Pack your heat up, blow your back out
You bad mouth, make 'em all believers
Throwing rocks from a glass house, y'all ain't perfect either
See that cheeba and that hash out (garbage day tomorrow)
And I have yet to take that trash out, or emptied this cigar
RZA Ra, we amped, eh, Meth is on his job
It ain't nothing, like the French say; "que sera sera"
So let's move on, until the day we laying in the casket
With them suits on, and I'm so cool that hell is only luke warm
Been too strong, for too, long, I'll probably die
With my boots on, and on my way to cash a coochie coupon
You know I'm, proper, don't let them boys confuse you
The fact is Meth, I'm harder than bottles made by Yoo-Hoo
Wu-Tang, welcome to the House of Flying Daggers
Where the truth aim, flying out the mouth of flying rappers
There it is...


Now, ask yourself, is this for real, it can't be
My, nigga, if it ain't for real, it ain't me
I, elect myself as presidential M.C
I, elect myself as presidential M.C
Now, ask yourself, why is he so low key
Why, is niggas pimpin' when the game chose me
I, elect myself as presidential M.C
I, elect myself as presidential M.C


Yo, blew 'em and hit 'em, and he went into a spin cycle
Out blew his liver, a river flooded, what's happening
It's drugs we wanted, gloves buttered, thug coverage
This is Fila, white sneaker, Louis Vitton luggage
I came, representative huddle, they all love you
That W, the legacy of little niggas muggin' you
The fuck, what's up with you, yo, you suck, nigga
Benches used to pluck niggas, we be on the roof, like "fuck you"
Them red beams is coming, losers, got to walk the plank
Users, with uzi's on 'em, you move, you getting spanked
Shank broilers banked, alcoholics ranked ballers
They should call us, I rock mad ice like a walrus
The lamesters decided to lure us, we was up in Freedomtown
Getting weeded, one Bentley tour bus, you might like the mack and explore dust
You can't fuck with all of us, one of us dropped, there's twenty more of us




Peel caps like tangerines, you shook/shake like tamberines
Then, jet from the set, in the all black Lamborghin'
Nobody seen me, bitch in a tini red bikini
Niggas saw her, because they thought they saw a genie
Heidi Klum, pussy juicy, fat as a plum
Picture on the wall in jail, niggas jerk til they come
God gargantuan, large, colossus, bombardment of darts
Make your squad, throw tantrums
Practice karma sutra on broads, pop bra's
Leave birds with permanent scars, and shit like birthmarks
Digi bark back at dogs, snatch flies from frogs
Blow California chronic to despise the smog
This shit I been with biz in the clearing, pigs sharing
Got fresh, Wu-Wearing, motherfuckers not caring
Then move through your community, with diplomat immunity
Move to rep a two or G., shine like fine jewelry




The Shadow Sword... Shadow Sword...

Chilling lounging with pretty mamas
Cables and cabanas, no dress code at club Katana
And jewish lawyers got us laughing in court at your honor
I skipped school cause gear my had me embarrassed

Facts I'm not tryna impress you, but since I got some status
I get picky now with who I say yes to
She clings cause I'm young and successful
Notices we're stuffed, and your belly is less full
And she becomes attached, cut her off, shit is stressful
Feeling I don't come to no rescue I don't give her no refuge
We just fuck in a king bed
And I don't drive her home I call the Uber out instead
I learn from my OGs that's what the son of a pimp said
Hustle till you get the crown on top of a king's head
Yeah, blowing bands life is grand I just had to say
It's a blessing trading verses with F.A.B. and Rae
On the rocks drinking Buillet not Aleezay
All day forever after bread homie that's the bay
Yeah, Eazy

Prince of thieves, catch me in the trees
Four long under the sleeves covered in leaves
Dark nights shooters, Rugers
Black capes folded over wranglers
The gold dobermans with keys
Run the town cracksmiths, we clack kids, we want a ransom
Or drop 'em out the most just answer
Who run them niggas who run niggas
Did somethin', but don't want nothin'
Just don't cuff 'em, bluff 'em
Pyramid mansions we give grandsons
Take 'em out of space, take apes, now go plan some
Yeah meet me at the end of the road
Been through the globe
No hoppin' in and out, this shit is global
We hood moguls with vocals
Niggas ride local, never been nowhere
We drop niggas out in the Poconos
Yeah a bunch of Rondos with condos
.45 hollows, ready to slide fly to Chicago
Eyes closed, money makin' Pablos who slob hoes
Never, I'd rather be sittin' in Key Largo
Yeah, yellin', "Bravo" with all of my hood niggas live though
This how the .45 blow


This is that real live extra rap calligraphy good shit, nigga
Only built for real niggas, man
Real motherfuckers man


Godfather energy, the ghosts play
Ay yo I bought one for minutes then strayed, I only drive karmas
Baseball hats and diamonds
Come through disgrace y'all, niggas ain't place of matrys
Automatic magnets, swag beds
Niggas'll grab necks, break your collar bone
Apply Lex should switch off and hit the globe
We in the numbers with different goals
While niggas bitchin', we in the Rolls just blowin'
Blood slow and stay off my circumference, homie
Where bosses live for real and it's lonely
Everybody strivin' to feast, we in the belly of the beast
Leech us, starve us, niggas wanna piece
That's why I stay humble and hard
Cross my path the wrong way, you dyin' and I'm flyin' in grace
Swim like Phelps over beats
I rhyme with the elites
Who live off the land takin' your eats, nigga




The Fuck?
It's just the new way of thinkin
Light up the broccoli kid
Throw the relish in my back pocket
Keep your eyes open
Push your seat back, just flow...
That's how we doin it

Bound by honest sword take over the set; rap from here to Que-bec
Throw up the tech, crash your intellect select a vet
Swimsuit mammal handle, yo every fly vandal go to project
Slam you like Hamill's wife 'fore the scandal
Wally sandal just a sample, my niggas fertilize thoughts
Yo mad support drink a quart then bamboo
When nasty can blew, my pen sterile won't perform if I'm not lampable
Askin my man'll get you slapped down; play the anthem
Lit it who wit it champagne get it, that's the ticket
Solid nines soundin like crickets snatchin worker shipment
Pull the air, long dick it, we talk right before we left lifted
Just like a long sleeve, guess who rip it?

 Projects
 My niggas survive, just like a movin target
 Projects
 Where niggas live and some sell garbage that's
 Projects
 Try to escape the flyin shells dodgin
 New York projects
 I'm livin large yo, stop miragin


Sign of the times, conspiracy to overthrow the mind
Behind every fortune there's a crime
This technique is tech-9
Blast at any Close Encounter of the Third Kind
This be the evil that man do, we dismantle, any adversary
Them niggas all thumbs and can't handle, my flurry
Hear me, you jam all you want to scare me
Don't even kid me, shit in my coke aimin at cha kidney
Pressure, Red Hot like Chili Pepper
Black 'n Decker, hardware avoid the leper
Five o'clock shadowboxer, hold down the sector
Bet ya bottom dollar lecture, be hard to swallow
Double oh-seven mark
The secret agent that Max/well and Get Smart, through entertainment
Welcome to The Killin Fields, with Johnny Dangerous
Headbanger boogie niggas goin thru changes

 Projects
 My niggas survive, just like a movin target
 Projects
 Where niggas live and some sell garbage that's
 Projects
 Try to escape the flyin shells dodgin
 Projects
 I'm livin large yo, stop miragin


Suck my dick it's the kid with the fat knob
I bust all into ya face, plus it come in globs
Quick get on your knees, with yo' sweet pussy let it breathe
Two fingers is all in your hole, think I can fit three
Your pink lips, spread it in shit, let me throw my dick in
Grab my shit and place it gently, on your clit
Ping-pong pussy, wide world of wombs titty saggin
Stomach on some scriveled up prune shit
Too much air in your pussy you screamin that it's
TALKIN TO YOU DADDY, fart's breathin out your lips splashin my dick badly
Use vinegar, to try to tighten up your ginger
All-mighty dick, ran in with a cape, some call him engine
Lightning rod bob, black candy cane attatched to God
Thick, like a great adventure cigar, in your garage
Pregnant pussy have you fall out, like Remi on the house
Watch the teeth for slobbin my shit
You bit it on the couch, dry pussy leave the friction burns
Plus beef I hone, the condom broke
Bitch you got AIDS I'm shakin in my bones




Caller: "So whassup, man?"
DJ: "Coolin', man."
C: "Chillin' chilin'? Yo, you know I had to call, you why right?"
DJ: "Why?"
C: "Because, you, I never ever call and ask you to play somethin', right?"
DJ: "Yeah."
C: "You know what I wanna hear, right?"
DJ: "Whatchu wanna hear?"
C: "I wanna hear that Wu-Tang joint."
DJ: "Wu-Tang again?"
C: "Ah yeah, again and again."


I smoke on the mic like "Smokin' Joe" Frazier
The hell-raiser, raisin' hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider-Man
So uhh, tick tock and keep tickin'
While I get you flippin' off the shit that I'm kickin'
The Lone Ranger, code red: Danger
Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart
The vandal too hot to handle
You battle, you're sayin' goodbye like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspectah Deck's on the set
The Rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal


The way I make the crowd go wild
Sit back, relax, won't smile
Rae got it goin' on, pal
Call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat
Blow up your project, then take all your assets
'Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, go flip on the next man
'Cause I grab the clip and
Hit you with 16 shots and more, I got
Goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh


It's the Method Man, for short Mr. Mef
Movin' on your left, UH!
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break, fool, cock me back
Small change, they puttin' shame in the game
I take aim and blow the nigga out the frame
And like Fame my style will live forever
Niggas crossin' over, but they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a "Suuu"?
Nuff respect due to the 1-6-oooh
I mean ohhh, yo, check out the flow
Like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off, because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt make me *cough*


Ooh, what, grab my nut, get screwed
Oww, here comes my Shaolin style
True B-A-ba-B-Y-U
To my crew with a "Suuuuuuu"


C'mon, baby baby, c'mon, baby baby
C'mon, baby baby, c'mon


Yo, you best protect ya neck


First things first, man, you're fuckin' with the worst
I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a fuckin' nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zu
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down, that shit is packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin'
Ason Unique rollin' with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
Bite my style, I'll bite your motherfuckin' ass


For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
There's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats; if Rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stompin' grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin' star
'Cause who I are is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar
Point-blank as I kick the square biz
There it is, you're fuckin' with pros, and there it goes


Yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that
It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feelin' mad hostile, wearin' Aropostale
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy robe, then attack the globe
With the buck-us style, the ruckus
Ten times ten men committin' mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums
(He'll be) comin' around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one down
Ju-Jugger-Genius, take us the fuck outta here


The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap
That's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact, bring out the girls, and let's have a mud fight!


You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck




Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to welcome to you
All the way from the slums of Shaolin
Special uninvited guests
Came in through the back door
Ladies and gentlemen, it's them!


Dance with the mantis, note the slim chances
Chant this anthem, swing like Pete Sampras
Taking it straight to Big Man On Campus
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Scandalous, made the metro panic
Cause static with or without the automatic
And while I'm at it, yo, you got cash, pass it
It's drastic, gotta send half to Dirty Bastard


Waves is spinning, blades is spinning
Slay em in the eighth inning
Stay truck, god stay playing linen
Kill rap, observe the uptowns, ho, feel that
Mink jeans on, seen where the real at
2000 Zitos, moving with a ill ego
For real, for real, ill lines, ill people
Yo, bring it back, 9 more civilians
Pollying deals, monopoly and bills, y'all niggas lying
Caught 300, lab look royal wit a mean stomach
Go broke, all seen, done it
Words from the heavy set, if I don't eat, then we already met
Fly ass bro, liver than coke


Now what Clan you know with lines this ill?
Bust shots at Big Ben like we got time to kill
Niggas can't gel or I'm just too high to tell
Put on my gasoline boots and walk through Hell
With 9 generals, 9 ninjas in your video
9 milli blow, semi-auto with no serial
Man metaphysical, I speak for criminals
Who don't pay they bills on time and fuck with digital
Never seen, smoke a bag of evergreen
My sword got a Jones, more heads for the severing
Johnny in the dungeon, taking all bets, throw ya ones in
Scared money don't make money, throw ya guns in


That's word to Damo, San Juan, Puerto Rico
Blowin hydro on a beach wit Tamiko
My gun bullet hollow for you to swallow
Blowin' the nozzle, hear it whistle
One in the head, this is code red, man for dead
X amount of lead spray from the barrel
Heat clear the street like Connor O'Carroll
Fully equipped, rifles, banana clip shit
To make my niggas from East New York flip


Yo, you may catch me in a pair of Polo Skipperys, matching cap
Razor blades in my gums (BOBBY!)
You may catch me in yellow Havana Joe's goose jumper
And my phaser off stun (BOBBY!)
Y'all might just catch me in the park playin' chess, studyin' math
Signin 7 and a sun (BOBBY!)
But you won't catch me without the ratchet, in the joint
Smoked out, dead broke or off point (BOBBY!)


Wallo's comfortable, chocolate frosting
Your socks hangin' out, yours is talkin'
Rock so steadily, son, I'm still crazy
Sport my old Force MD furs from the 80's
Nat Turners wit burners, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Taught y'all niggas how to rap, reimburse me
Rothsdale's, ruby red sales, Bloomingdale's, blocks
Ox tails chopped up in Caribbean spots
I'm nice, maxed out, creepin' wit the ax out
Murder these bikini bitches, switchin with they backs out


Niggas wanna pop shit, I pop clips
Bitch, I'll put my dick on ya lips
Alabama split, hammer slay quick
That David Banner gamma ray shit
Shells in the mouth, jailhouse snitch
My powder voice, Snow White sniff
Verbal killas, gorilla grip
God body shit, puff Marley spliffs


You might see me in a 6, that's not my style
You might see me wit a bitch, that's not my child
I be in the benzo, keep a low profile
Dead serious, take flicks and don't smile
Tryin' to get money, y'all cats is wild
I pose for the clothes, make a song like wild
I'm a chip off the board game, got sword game
Live life to the fullest, still want more fame
Darts on layaway, beats on standby
Outfits pressed up, ready for airtime


Run on the track like Jesse Owens
Broke the record flowin', without any knowin'
That my wordplay run the 400 meter relay
It's on once I grab the baton from the DJ
A athlete wit his iron cleat in the ground
Wireless nigga who sprint off the gun sound
The best time yet still 7.0
Swift flow made the cameramen clothes blow




Forever may not exist
But man do we got our moments
Killing time, making a name
Wasnt about money or the fame
Why hide the scars?
Its who we are
Its who we are


Purple cloths on me, salute my presence
DNA is worth a fortune but I've still seen a life of peasants
I gave y'all style, taught you how to be fly, go 'head and grace the sky
Gave you wings to soar like you ought to
Forever may not exist in the flesh but my music will
All praises due to the Most High
With my toast, shocked the world, wasn't Casper when I said
I came through when the roaster blow in half a Billy Goat
Just because I'm living this life I'm accustomed to it
Floating in them fly cars, damn I'm supposed to do it
Pretty women fall in love with my expensive taste, luxury, lust
Physical touch by this ace, handcuff 'em
That's a no no 'cause I don't trust them far as I can throw those
Gold diggin' vixens who's in love with the coco
But fuck it, you know I'm here for this dough though
Let's pop another bottle of Don and watch our gross grow
I love it


Forever may not exist
But man do we got our moments
Killing time, making a name
Wasnt about money or the fame
Why hide scars?
Its who we are
Its who we are


Clarity stones in my bracelets, watches and rings
From a rich nigga's perspective you know what that brings
Hatred, what do I do when I'm so used to shittin' on 'em
Do I stop because a jealous ass coward wants me to
Or do I go harder and buy more diamonds and blind his crew
Fuck it, I guess I do that 'cause I love to make 'em blue
Getting 'em bags,  stayin' fly, stayin' high
Do what I wanna, no more strugglin' just to get by
Yes, fresher than a new born baby's ass
New money, got my ex wishin' she was never in my past
I laugh, enjoy these fruits from my labor
But still feel the strain and pain that be from my labor
Spent my time to achieve all of the fortune and fame
And for myself makin' a name
But deep inside I try to cover up the scars to be a shinin' star
I guess that's just who we are


Forever may not exist
But man do we got our moments
Killing time, making a name
Wasnt about money or the fame
Why hide scars?
Its who we are
Its who we are


Forever may not exist but who else is as hot as this?
I played the beat then I tried at this
Cuban links on my neck and I just put a presidential on my wrist
This year you haters gonna acknowledge this
It's G-Rapo and Raekwon, told the homies this wouldn't take long
My verses always just as real as the true story it's based on
Chopped the blow on the table plenty times
In the lines that she puts her face on
And this is not by accident
Anything can happen if you simply imagine it
My OG put a torch to the blunt then he's passin' it
Believe in something, stand for it or take a knee and stand like Kaepernick
Anything to get the point across makin' a statement
You'll only go as far as you take it
20 years later and we're still slappin' that purple tape shit
Greatness so close I can taste it, face it


Forever may not exist
But man do we got our moments
Killing time, making a name
Wasnt about money or the fame
Why hide scars?
Its who we are
Its who we are




What up soldier? (What up playboy?)
Yeah, yeah this is Shaolin reporting in (OK)
Checkin' you out, I'm hearin' about Force Reveal (yeah, yeah)
They said one kid, that's standin' real grown out there right now
(I, go, by the name of Posta)
That's my man! So, yo, son? (What up, Rae?)
You know what you gotta do!


Aiyo, I don't give a fuck what level you on
When the metal is drawn, either your life or your bezel is gone
I don't really wanna hurt ya'll fags but I'm sitting on paper
I got Universal mad, Raekwon in a purple Jag
P.B. in a cantaloupe Hummer with commercial tags
Ya'll ask the chicks who wrap the bricks
I'm out to give Harlem, a quick flashback of Rich
I'm blow like C4, burn up be more
Layin' that Cheetah, next day in a G4
Think like a veteran, choppin' and measurin'
Always got a way, but God got eleven in
Little kids follow me, women, they acknowledge me
New year, new rules, and a new policy
Posta good, Posta hood, Posta real, Posta do what Posta could
P.B. stay blowin' a stink
When the girls give me a hug, they all smell the dro on the mink
Go line for line, dart for dart, heart to heart
We layin' on top of charts
See me buggin on Melrose, low top shell toes
Suede addition, U.S. don't sell those
Posta hot, Posta not, did Posta flop?
Please get off of, of Posta cock


OK? Ya'll little chumps roll out the red carpet
For the Postaboy, man, I got Uncle Rae with me
Raekwon the Chef, is in the building
Might wanna holla!


Catch me at a Balley convention, sweater look, worth the money
Auctionin' and buy me a building
Matter fact niggas, might try to bubble in it
You know, the X.T. Click, niggas fell in love with it
Jumpin' out of Akademic jumpers, Nike pumps, jewelry down
G'in' like Trump, sweetie, you drunk
Position my thoughts, heavy loss
Root for the Maybach, one for your girl, you write it off
With the new color, only six made, we in the world, like
Whatever we rockin', that's on the trade
Whata's the verdict? It's murder, we preserve, niggas
Automatic birds, hang gun hammers, grenades, got words on you
Swerve on you, browsin', all through your housing
Jakes stop me, try to take forty thousand
Playin' it kid, you won't make a thousand
Yeah, the Larry Davis version, force to build Shaolin


But now my time, has come
And time, time, is not on you side



 Back-up from the Bronx, Uh
 Psycho Iko
 Yeah
 E-Dub
 This ain't nothing but drama

ODB Cut: "Psycho, Killer, Norman Bates"


Who's one of the dopest MC's rockin mics for years (You)
Ask any cat in the streets and he'll point right here (Uhu)
Shine everywhere I go without droppin shit for years
Niggas know this nigga, _Crossover_ to _Golddigger_
Come with the broken language like Smoothe da Hustler and Trigga (Uhu)
My bombs are bigger, can't touch a harmless figure
Cause is stay razor sharp like my name was RZA
PMD built a dynasty like Jigga


Yeah, P my nigga, time to cock back pull the trigger
He a bigger nigga with figures but I'm a bigger nigga
Duh, I'm a snub nose, I'm way above those
I got beef and I sit 'til the club closed
Lights come on, I'm bombin
Viet-Nam-em, Napalm-em, AK I calm them
Mom like "Who harmed them?"

 I don't know, but they put em in the news and Saddam'd 'em
 And nobody warned 'em


This is what it sounds like when you puttin work in
Like Norman Bates pullin back the shower curtains (Uhu)
Or like in _Headbanger_ black birds chirpin
This is what it sounds like when you puttin work in

Mausberg heavy (Check, puttin work in)
Tec-9's steady (Check, puttin work in)
Shotgun heavy (Check, puttin work in)
Machine gun's ready (Check, puttin work in)


We from the era of the red white and green sweater
Cream getter, gleam better
You know what? the team is clever
Fuck niggas up get drunk pull out a bigger pump
Sell crack, all day rep, rock the meanest leather
Flip you all day chump, mad make you pay
No doubt, gun in his mouth, he leanin on Broadway
HipHop gangsters for real, check the archives
Four Fives, knives, catch you in the sunrise
Powerful impact, boom, from the canon
This is not slain to take mine, take this ammo with it
Big boys, pretty boys, shottin pretty toys
Pull out the new joints and lower the noise
The records that we make straight classics
Built for Benzes, Astons, high powered assassins
Put that major work in, holler, blash the collar
Erick, Parrish, mash them dollars up






Niggas got me the behind the pot again, but yo


The Pyrex is bubbling, the stove is broke
Fuck it, use the flame from the oven, the famous dozen
Bout to hit the streets, they buzzing, break it down, yo
Chop it like he raided your luggage
Major yellow shit in the pot, struggling
Trying to form a rock up, and double it, and call up my cousin
What up beloved? Stab it, tilt and twirl, spit in it
Plus put a little bit of milk in, fiends love it
Sat back, confident in comfort, the light blew out
All I see is all white stuff, suds in it
Four hundred razors in a bucket, seventy plates
We thinking ten mil a man, nigga, fuck it
It's on, get the baking soda, dump it
How many niggas'll pump to get eighty more? Get it jumping
Live by the code and we thumping
Nigga take this, fuck around and taste a flake bitch, you drunk it
It's all in the eyes of the hungry
It's all for the wise and the humbly, their eyes came upon me




Chef... let's do it...


Criminal kingpins, gangstas and cheap friends
Actors, vixens, niggas put your kicks in
Blood money when we hawking, ackward gun that go around curves
Bullets braze niggas with coffin, yo
Watch how to rhyme with hammers, I got two mens
That don't speak English, shooting game's bananas
Down in Spain, my bangles, clusty, checking my swings
Trillians on, yo, cuffing my jeans
Broad day, yo, body another, my microphone is like
Blow 'caine, one, pull the trees, you love us, yo
So killers be cool, pimps, read rules
When a grown man is rapping, it's Ill Street Blues
Striving, nigga, with one side
Don't go against totally rent shit, nigga, baby gonna die
Yeah, bank robbers armored up, gear like the boys in Heat
DeNiro told one soul to keep quiet


Aiyo, word to mother
Ya'll niggas better bring ya selfs son, word


When Pun was packing a mack in back of the Acura
I was dealing in them buildings, it wasn't no cameras
The witness savages, snitching was hazardous, now it isin't
Shit is embarrasing, fuck a flow, this is a lyrical aquaduct
Sink or swim for what I'm hearing you bagging up
Lyte like the MC, I'm 'paper thin', you tripping
I'm taking trips, your eyes don't lie, take a glimpse
Into my life, you see me blazing clips, with the green to make it rich
With a team that'll scrape the Knicks, and a v that's crazy quick
I came to wear my Yankee fitted, represent for greatness
It's lyrical elevation, causing mental stimulation
If I'm getting too deep, I give you a minute to take in
My jewels radiant, like a view of the Caymans
And thinking you seeing me, who you playing with?
Cor, Mega, raw forever
Fell back, pause, fell off? Never


P! Shaolin, what up?


Aiyo, listen giraffe neck niggas, I blast techs
Alejandro, came through with the Mexican Aztecs
Rap smack niggas on a whole different aspect
Homey, owe me dough, that's how we fucked up his last check
Three train Saratoga, train stop, nigga been
Metro part with the plan, make major figures
Foul flagrant, two shots, give me the ball back
You got shot, get off my ball sack
You not hot, give me a call back, niggas is all wack
Super doopa stupid, get drugs and I fall back
P, ain't a problem that the God can't handle
I set it off First Blood, Sean John Rambo
Whoooo, as you can see, I'm focused
Boot Camp for life, fuck the G.I. Joe shit
Boot Camp is an Army, better yet a Navy
Marine Air Force Ones, nigga, the shit's crazy, don't play me




You will be punished (Wu-Tang style)
For all your evil deeds (Wu-Tang style)
Be warned - you will suffer (Wu-Tang style)
Justice (Wu-Tang style)


Slept on this hazardous enterprise
Hit from the back, from a long range attack in disguise
Week self-captivity became months
Those who were holdin' it down they hold a pump
Do we delay the conflict and prolong the suffer?
Got a mass of starvin' niggas wanna eat supper
Unfair corruptions lead to abductions
Creatin' wider circles of destructions
So we attack, with the pen and blaze in
From the terrifyin' to the fascinating
Quick to slay a narrow minded nigga that's hasty to give credit
Full of hostile overtones mixed with wack edits
They heavily defended airfields
But they bodies rot behind punctured steels
When I greeted you, you didn't hear a piece of my voice?
Oh that water was my liquid of choice
Forensic couldn't tell it, it was nine tons of steel pellet
Powerful projection, noise is deafening
Carrier battle groups, that's threatening
Higher level bombing, plus
The shipment in hand known as alarming, bells ring loud
In the same crucial manner but different style


Wu-Tang style
Wu-Tang style


Ayo once again, all blunts again
Yo the real remain silent, any type of violence I'm in
Allah's helpful most, innovative raps
That brought wealth through, shot out the belch too
We holdin', automatic semis with sick lines
Run up, body niggas, break down shoddy niggas
Styles so sharp, state of the art
Greater the mark, flyest creator sprayed layin' darts
Flowin' like water, "Apocalypse Now"
Gun out blaow, wow the shit's wild when you short us
Runnin' through parkin' lots, don't get caught
Let off, bark your shots, we outta here, off the blocks


It ain't all to the good, muh'fuckers hatin' in the hood
Gotta a hundred wolves waitin' in the woods
For the Clan's forthcomin'
I miss you in the game a court summons
And fugitives of rap caught runnin, y'all get locked up
E'rything was wack 'til we popped up
And got it on and poppin' like Orville Reddenbacher
Potnah, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
Wu-Tang got ya, like every ghetto got a Tasha
Request lines are now open, you see these MC's chokin'
And thinkin', "What's that SHIT they be smokin'?"
I'm so focused, simple chronic halitosis
Keep my shit funky when I spit this braggadocious
{*hach, spit*} Y'all niggas got some fuckin nerve
To critic what I write, that's my muh'fuckin word
Blah blah blah, like N'Sync
Kiss that ass bye bye bye knahmsayin'? I ain't playin'


Many shall come, few chose to stay exact
Track after track I'm fightin' for survival
Before me I see hills and mountains they sway
The words gotta move and the crowd's like the ocean
I walk water holdin' y'all suspended with the vocal
What's the total people that came to see the Gods?
I gave thought talent, construct my best poetry
Potentcy, high-level content
Side effect may cause a tec to eject, many places
All ages streets to cages, split faces
Shoutin' nuff love to the peeps from Miami
We live from Pulaski and spread glassy


Wu-Tang style




Holllllllld it!
Now you get out of here, I'm warning you
(You bastards can't push us around - wanna fight?)
I'll take you on


That nigga's twisted
Stop playin with that clip man
Close them fuckin blinds too man, y'knahmsayin?
Yo Don my man, get out of the stove man
Get away from the stove nigga
Stop playin man, the fuck is you talkin 'bout?

(Verse One: Raekwon)
I'm in the crib watchin Larry King Live, the new Guccis on
Refrigerator, smokin some kush, this nigga's a lighter
Swisher, becoming a roach, go get the glass ashtray
Pour the glass of Cru, tap the bottle then toast
Barrie took a sip for the cause, yeah my son
Soon to be 3, tried to fill his bottle then run
Then I got a collect call, heard niggas down the block is fighting
Some nigga got knifed up brawling
Heard the kid was 19, Little Infiniti too
His father worked up at the dealer he love Wu
They tried him for his Louis', son wasn't having it though
Yeah, yeah my nigga, the color of glue
Decided i'mma intervene, guess who tried to wild on me my nigga
This is like out of the blue
I'm in the Range stretch, jumped out, tucked the chain
Proceeded to talk to him, then you heard the heavy face slap
Think I broke my wrist, now I'm at the hospital vexed
Fucked up my writing hand, that's my check
Now I wanna kill this little nigga true
Only thing that stop my gun flaming cause he related to you


Who? He ain't related to me
Just that I knew him for like 18 years until he violated, stealing my gear
If my lil' homey, yo he eat anything for me
Send him uptown, he get bagged, yo he never call me
Come home and still blow cats for me
Pump crack, stabbing all them hoodrat shorties
A live gunslinger well known, born to dance
When the heat is on, Stapleton days, shot himself in the groin
The gun went off, it looked like a flick
When he fell to the floor, holding his nuts, screaming "God damnit
Shit I put one in my balls, what the fuck y'all looking at me for?
Call the police, do something
Motherfuckers standing around, watch when I get better
All hell's gonna be terror
Death to you, you," he pointed at Red
I said chill, that's fam duke
He put real work in that make you puke, fuck that
But anyway son indeed, he stole two Polo rugbies
Swore to his dead mother, I couldn't take it
Yo Lord I knocked out his teeth
Now he's rocking those false joints like everything's peace




It's a mystery inside
Of how I'm gonna get mine
I'm thinking 'bout so many ways
Of how to conquer these rainy days


You sang beautifully just now
I sing for him, and he isn't here


It's going down man, word man, what's up black?
Niggas just fuckin' robbed my gate man


Word?


Fuckin'... I'mma murder somebody man
For real I ain't playing, whatever whatever


It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane


The war is on, yo
On rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich son, show and prove, ask my bitch
Stood up late nights, build with my a-alikes
We can pull a heist, snatch ice, or rock mics
But this rap shit, got me wanna clack back the latch
How it goes the only pesos made from scratch
But in due time, soon to get mine like Bugsy
Heavy on the wrist, Polo Moc, Socks and Rugby's
Old flicks remind me of Gucci's
Back in Union Square when little Maxmil, blast Pierre
That was Build Build, fast forward, ninety-four
Who got the bad base? Filthiest fiends scream for more
Bless me out of state, howdy Jake, Starks is back
Niggas want work, 9 brought back off a g-pack
Coke rocks flood the co-ops living gossip
Them big lip niggas singing to cops need to box it
Stop it, the projects overflooded with slow leaks
The fiends get, new faces get wrapped in sheets
I gotta get mine, like my old Earth, bless the cheese line
Sipping on fine wine, the power of the blacks refined
(Rainy days) Divine
Waiting on these royalties takes too long
It's like waiting on babies, it makes me want to slay thee
But that's ungodly, so yo God, pardon me
I need it real quick, the dough flow like penmanship
Meat heads get pistol-whipped, I blow spots like horse shit
So now talk shit, nigga what?


It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane


What brings rain, hail, snow, and earthquakes
The beat breaks, cause all my niggas to break son
Styles is similar to criminals locked up
With gats, ghetto tabernacles is fucked up
I live once though, the mind stays infinite
Traveling to touch nine planets, in my midst
While I carry, to earn a decent salary
Soon get married, raise a family, but the plan'll be
Real great, to sit up in the loft, count stacks and max
And real cats cold watch my back
But listen to the Wu son, and maintain
It's all real, starving individuals kill
I puff what's only right, leave the poison alone
Projects, infested with rats, cats, and crack homes
Half of us'll try to make it, the other half'll try to take it
So many fake half real freedom-build
Born to science my alliance analyzes
Wild surprises, keeping my eyes wide to this
The unfortunate, laying in mountains counting
With jewelry on, can it be the next team house the horn
Chill dun, just for real ones, light the lye up
I hate to have to tie the next guy up
Pay attention to 1010 WINS, Wu blends
Now I'm steering you to truth, buckle up
Now who's a legend?


It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane


Word up dun
Peace to Philly, VA, these days
Word up y'all, word up
The sun moon and stars fly cars, word up y'all


No sunlight, more gun fights
I've lost him to the street life, street life
No cash flow, no more dough
He's someone I don't even know, someone I don't know
Rainy Dayz, getting through those rainy dayz
I lost him to the street life, the street life, whoa




Doing this for 1996
Revolution is a trick, be aware


Yo, yo, yo
I run with rich rap cats who run corners
They run through alleys, navy blue Ballys at the grand finale
Still in all, currency catches the eye of the youth
One time, play it on three corners of the roof
So we accept that, jetting at nights
Don't ever wet that, drop the G-pack how will I eat black
And brothers, flexing labels like cables
White Sables, pressing up, trying to make a debut
Hard times, when the God rhyme I'm aiming mines
Cause he playing mines but
We ain't related cause he raided mine
They see me lamping up in 850's
With 360's, blowing like 160 selling fifties
Due to the wicked, dice should never lie
Now that's a damn lie, proving on standby, man why?
The game, I mentally tear down the brain
Half of us are feeling pain, big boy, let it rain
I guess my whole team is marvelous
Street life novelist, let it rain dun, swallow this


You know how to love me, makes me feel so good (Repeat x2)


Guess down, a crazy new pair just for the new year
Wavy hair plus we get much cause we on the air
Cristal whyling my medallion, styling it's like city island
Relax kid, while shorty profiling
Until then, we got to bend with the wind
Plus build again, writing my friends sending 'em line Timbs
I'm tired of robberies, pornography
Throw a pair of Wally's on post for live nigga photography




Check out the hearsay, fake niggas rocking the toupee
Fronting on me and Chef, yo it's dog day
Afternoon I'm blowing up your weak platoon
Leave you helpless, screaming from all types of wounds
I be the expert, blowing like a firework
Converting concepts that will nerve-wreck in concert
Cause I write, and blast and slash your whole level
I'm hosed I be challenging pros for gold medals
Whatever, still remain sturdy like a leather
On Fridays, get your fresh fade from Mo' Better
Represent, my lifestyle is in like Flynn
Militant the God's shit is very masculine
Mad tough, major bless stuff with nuff said
Ex-dusthead, now I'm putting heads to bed
Call me a legend, flexing with the style of old
Carrying loads of loot, mad rich, burying gold
Sabotage, thoughts of living large any day now
The land to satisfy the whole garage
Back to the morrow, soon to make a novel
Born to be selling like Marvel Comic books for my survival
Beware, I'm hitting like a snare from the Delphonics
Crushing niggas I be blowing like economics
What's the... you're fucking with a deadly era
No fat, niggas be jetting when they face terror






Yeah, what, what, yeah
Shout out the 18th letter, you know?
Word up... we gon' do it like this
And pay homage to the most livest
Yeah.. yo...


I ain't no joke, I used to let the mic smoke
Now I slam it when I'm done, give me my ten G coat
To perform another song, cuz I won't let
Nobody press up and mess up, the scene I wet
I like to stand in the crowd, and watch niggas wonder
Damn, then think about, then you wonder
Clan, they just rag shit, rip shit, bruise shit
Maybe that's the rap shit, I gotta prove shit
Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
Now flip the beat up, convert it to a hip hop joint
Write a rhyme and graffiti in, every show you see me in
Deep concentration, swift like the beamer, kid
Go with the crowd, while my lyrics spit flames
I flow-tate the vowel, cuz it's all in my veins
Another remedy, fly niggas is enemy
Cuz I'm live as some rap niggas with energy
Now do it, cuz I'mma put the nine on pause
My sharks beaming, catch you on the side of the store
Call your bluff, make you stare in my face, ya team suck
Remember me? The one you got your ideas from
How soon you start to suffer, until you get stuck up
When you start to fuck up, that's when you get bucked up
Bitin me, you think you dope, I smash your boat, with bad coke
You should of wrote, because I ain't no joke


It's been a long time, I shouldn't have let you
Without a re-up to connect to
Think of all the weak product you slept through
Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you


I was a fiend, before I was seventeen
I melt the microphone like blowing some evergreen
It's all in the making, from where hip hop was originated
Peace to the streets, the bubblers, mark & dated
Cuz I grab the mic, now I say "yes ya'll"
Ya'll yell 'scrape it', then I'mma say 'let's ball'
Come on, cool, cuz I'mma get on rep
Twist a 'dro on the speaker, pull the snub and then flex
Back to them crabs, ya'll niggas had ya'll laughs
And then I spaz on the rhymes I splashed
From back to your brother gun, then I grab the double pump
Then this the opposite, and ask if another come
Cuz I'mma get busy, get dough with my team, yup
I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm raging, rip up the stage and don't it amazing
Cuz every line is laid in
Caught up, thoughts are sort a, an addiction
Bags of pies, smell of bricks, kid
Vocals vocabulary, the stage is a suction
The mic is a draino, volcanos erupting
Lines overblowing, gradually glowing
Every thing is written in the cold, slick & coin'
Slide.. my thoughts'll glide
Forty-eight MAC's and knives
The invincible, microphone fiend, Raekwon
Spread the word, cuz it's on
B-E-R-E-A-L, a smooth operator with notorious crack sales




I don't want it, I don't want it
Never getting off my grind, cause I
Love you..


They call him Mr. Staten Island, gats, New Balance is coming through
Hood hikers smoking them woods, alotta pull lightning
Neck, finger icey, peel out of rent, niggas do them good heistes
Halibit fishes, with different colored rices
All my niggas, behind pots, sturring, blocks we serving
Two for five, slide in the building, heard me?
White fishscale, take a whiff, shit's real
Don't ever approach with no whitey's and big bills
The fuck doctor, I only truck jewelry on gold locking
Most of my money is grounded and gwop it
For every gate caking, we gon' collect the model
Respect it, or get your hand chopped off, drowned in Moet
The places I've been, seen alotta faces on the move
Pacing Yankee hats low, what up Allah, stay gracious
Applying refinement, stretched lands, grams in the SoHo Grand
Where I blaze pussies and purple hazes
Sippin' saki, BET'in it, dick Rocky, Bruce Wayne frame
Froms the creator of Versace, yo
Everybody lit, money to split, on birthday's
We call 'em earth days, buy that nigga a whip
So when the D's pull up, we fully equipped
Checkbook credit card, license fifth, my wife just flipped
Puerto Ric' ass, with skinny TV's, cheese in the ceiling fan
Mister Money from all the flips




The niggas commercial...
Fuck outta here, you know where we came from
Word? Word up... nigga don't wanna shadowbox this, son
Right, right, right... yeah, wheelie in one hand
Right, you know it God, check the tale of the tape
Tale of the tape, yo, son, yo, son, yo


This Alaskan nigga approached me, he had suede on
Caesar head half moon, had his weight on
Five sixty drop, rest in Barbados
Stacked potatos, like he rich shit, have Play-Doh
What's your name? Louis Rich the Third
Back your herb, half of that, kid, polly your bird
Now we speakin', took off my hat, waves leaking
Beat your beak, he acting like he know about reef'
He still unsure, other than that, feel more than safe
Let money fake, I got three, for his hate
That more up, thought a nigga would front and fold up
Threw a medallion out, rocks all rolled up
Whose your beagles, money grabbing his gin
Puffin' illegal, that's chico, yo, what up with Rico?
He's chilling, plan status, nigga with that rams had
Check the stands, then check where his hands at
Jewels is gorgeous, priceless shit that's foolish
Fifteen, thousand in the trunk, he asked for Louis
Cat reached, grabbed his burner, shots'll lease
Like a new Sable, yo, except one touch the God niece
Emotional, throwing up shots like they promotional
Shorty run for the door, hit the floor composable
Stop playing, banging on the door, jakes laying
Something crazy, he had a eighty in the cab BM


Stay still kid, them niggas over there, want drama
Hold your head, sorta like Wu vs. Llama
Rap pehito, salute them niggas who got shit
Calico pop shit, rap burglar rock shit


You bein watched like you new on the block, from roof tops
Get your bruise on, it's hot shots, pop, music stops
Party's over, bold soldier move for his holster
Shot the lights out, struck the bouncer in his shoulder
Hard times for po-9, they can't control the masses, scream for Wu
Backstage, we slingin' V.I.P. passes
Jakes sprayin mace, riots be takin place
When the Clan show they face, the fans slow they place
Get your blunt rolled, fuck the 5-0, they want it dun' know
Bitches gettin' trampled, niggas wildin the front row
Fire marshall catch a beat down, tryin to cut my sound
Radio dispatcher, back-up, bustin rounds
Without intermission from a crouched position
Bullets ricochet off the strobe-lights, strikin Christians
My nigga slipped in, 'nuff ammunition, to bust back
Fuck that, them out-of-town cats'll take the rap
It's war on the dance floor, quarter to 4
Before we peeled off, they tried to seal off the back door
Gats for the beast, high persuit down the side streets
Shot up my getaway Jeep, crashed the front glass
And blew the head rest off the passenger seat
I grabbed the heat, ditched the whip and then escaped on feet
While the locals interrogated for names and photos
Work with 5-0, swappin info for dough




What, what, from here to Indianapolis...




The Vatican, underground academy
Jazze Cuts, Skeezo, good looking
(Yo, Kay what up, let's go baby)


Nine silver Ferrari's, hard body
Moving through the town, with brown on us
Clowns don't love us, discussed and ropes on
The oath, the big mold bread, the stages is red
You never reapproach, bulletproof down in diesel shit
Lethal with the pen, the sequel, bitch
Rich will deceive you, flying at 90, the boss
Red Porsche, this the time when I get mine
I rhyme til I'm hoarse, good weather, caught in the cross
Break porcelain when I rap, it's only right
I flash on the source, extra my curriculars major
Register this, we miss you will die later
Caught in a bliss, this stormy weather winter hat
Moving in with Benz jackets and action
This is all about who get endorsed
This for stabbers, night time paper Mick Jaggers
Jag Benz Maybach braggers, caught up in the sport
Speak French and eat with the chimps, the underground academy
I rap rapidly and clap at the pimps
One shot'll blow a hostile's wig off
Me crafted by the mobsters, Vatican's blast ya shit off
I'm caught up in the level of largeness
Chef Oliver, a denny boy, getting money, we mob kids
Pushing through Paris, lavish lifestyle with no marriage
Only big Euro's, we hero's


We them rap killers (come through the town, dunny move)
We them rap killers (fuck around with mine and you lose)
We them rap killers...




Uh, expensive things, diamond rings and things
You know, rap life, rap life, say what, ah, uh

Rap niggas, we dippin individuals
Some of us be frontin, some of us is really criminals
Swimmin in the women and money we never had, it's sad
Rap could turn a good nigga bad
But not CaTash though I gaffle respect with no hassle
I'm still the same nigga, light skinded, curly afro
Whats up though, I'm still the same nigga, a superfreak
I blow a G a week, catch me burnin rubber up the street
Rap niggas, always smokin indo
So everytime we puff, it's twenty dollars out the window
But what is friends fo', we gonna blow that dough regardless
My niggas live the life and they ain't even rap artists
Rap money, we get that shit and blow it
We trick thirty G's and ain't got shit to show for it
Let me get that case of Moet, let me get that CLK
Let me get that ounce of bomb from my man from East L.A
Let me get that

Chorus: Raekwon the Chef

Rap niggas get money, press up and get hundreds
Be like all them niggas on it
Which side rock the most, it don't matter cause it get notes
Meet you on the left side of the boat
Coast, drivin it most, we like where them niggas go
We like everywhere, party where the fans go
It's all rap hype, young black niggas that's mad hype
Got ya station in a smash right


My Likwit niggas made a killin
We dropped three albums and got the whole world dancin on the ceilin
So I'm feelin like the villian that cracked that safe's combo
My nigga had some hoes, I told him shoot em through my condo
He shot em through, they peeped my CD through
They startin askin questions, but fuck the interview
What y'all really wanna do? They said, "Pop the Cris"
I said you like rap? Well wrap ya mouth around this!
Rap niggas, young niggas ballin
We on the motorcyles doin ninety down my hall and
With the gold chain swingin fallin to the street
This rap life got us buyin shit we don't need
We don't need the jet skis but let's buy em, just to try em
We splashin out the Lex and got all the ladies eyein
Us now, and we don't fuck around with no wife
Cause all my niggas is livin the rap life

Chorus


First of all before we move on
Shit is like a Yukon son, slide shit on like Grey Poupon
Mergin in the suburbs, gettin raw with greenery herb
Real ill niggas smack birds
Fat words showin proof how my gat work, go shoot, kill
Smack a blackbird, jettin in an Ac-hurse
Big Jim stay grinnin in a six spinnin it kid
Nigga who flex, lex threw ten in him
Stand posin blowin shit, coast from east and west
We rockin our vest, cannon might roast you
High powered hydrolic Eddie Bauer Rockwilder
Who wilder, slang bit niggas on the collar
Amp might blow, I might land, set up shop and glow
Shinin like a lamp post, my camp post
Cream leather green leaves forever
Goin to do whatever, corns and crab niggas, they roll together
What up Tash, black hash, we invented the spaz
High like sixteen niggas over ten bags
Real niggas gon ride, fake niggas gon slidide
Check the next issue faggot in the vidibe


Rap drama, the drama never calms
I be on the celly phone trippin off my baby moms
Tryna make her understand I get paid to rhyme
I don't show up at your job, so don't show up at mine!
Cause there's no biz like shobiz if y'all niggas ask me
Show money, that's like pimpin, cause we get it tax free
Catch a check for 33, cut straight from SRC
Take it straight to any counter, cash my shit with no I.D
Rap women, they always be around us
Cause we from out of town and they be lovin out of towners
Wash up in motherfuckas like a T.V. evangelist
Cause they from where they from and we straight from Los Angeles
Rap money

(Rae) Yo, what up
(Tash) Whats up nigga
(Rae) What's goin on?
(Tash) Hey, whats up Rae, lets go half on a football team nigga, hehe
(Rae) Yo, I was thinkin about buyin two basketball teams
Whats up? What we gonna do?
(Tash) Hey, hehe
(Rae) Matter fact, we can do that. Lets do that

Chorus




Yes, the shit is raw, comin at ya door
Yes, the shit is raw, comin at ya door
Yes, the shit is raw, comin at ya door
Start to scream out loud, Cream Team's back for more


900 dollars on the glass table
Wally Clark Gable unable
Blow it on a grey goose
Picture that, elephant skin
Cardier glasses dim
What's that? Gold around the rim
Hollywoodizin, without goin Hollywood
Polly for all, Cream Team playas in the hood
Stop that scrutenizin, naturize
See my paper rise, promotin it at Lakeshore Drive
Trickin at the shark bar, God
Make sure the collar greens got turkey bars par, we got you Allah
Rare start grappin the hair, playin Cuban Linx
Spinnin like the swivel chair, yea
No question


The peeps flippin, actin like she wanted me to pipe her
And they got you jealous, claimin that you never liked her
Then I found out y'all was too many dykers
Now I'm hyper, beggin you to hook me with a cypher
See me in the tunnel and you trouble me
Get my dick hard dancin, sippin my bubbly
Yo, beat me in the head, talkin 'bout how you got a man
That can't get freaky as I wanna be
No talk, Giant Size in the game
Colt 45, appliance in the game
Tyra's in the game, huh?
Relyin on money, to make sure that my environment change




2:15 and I'm blasted, smack that ass kid
Light skin, what up? Stop splashin
Slang got niggas in the choke hold
Freakin their coats, got $64,000 on clothes, yo
Wu-Wear jackets and hats, relaxin, bets play that
Ping-pong champion cats, what?
Chantin out Walk Myers
Yo, the weather is nice, flex the Benz
With $10,000 in flyers


The squellin I'm for in the six range things
Make the loyaliest cats, Flipmode do strange things
Switch like change lanes, chains, rings and glaciers
Stay phat in it


Man, I can't stand them chicks, I dig for Vanson
Play a brother close to Puff is Branson
Ice work, gleamin I'm catchin them, glancin
I play 'em no mon', 'bout to bar dance 'em
White bitches with Banky like, "You handsome"
Flyin to the hills, to fuck in the mansion
Only one way you spendin the night in here tonight
*singing* If your head is right


Dance turn into a romance
Dance turn into a romance

Get up, get down, move around, cover ground
Throw it on the brother now, you swore
I had your mother on the ground
High rollers that know us
Crisp pop, giftshop, hollas that rock Polo's
Here they hold they shoulders, yo
Lay it like a chain be on, we on Cream Team
Play on, with all grey on, flavor like crayon








Yeah!
I wanna let allllll y'all niggas know in here tonight
That this is that Wu-Tang shit
This that shit that's gonna get you high... {*echoes*}
See when you stimulate your own mind, for one common cause
You see, who's the real motherfuckers
See what you see, is you what you see
(You nuh see it? Wu-Tang a-run tings!)
Be the original G
Rhymin on timin and in the place to be
(Run blood claat tings!)
They love see meeeeeeee!


You're a crossbreed, I'm a knowledge seed
I want ACTION, that's what I need
I never put doubt in my mind
Cause I know when I touch the mic it's the rhyme
See murder which is caused
When you fuck with the negative and positive charge
Then they came up, out my garage
With the hit that's gonna be LARGE
Tired of sittin on my fuckin ass
Niggas I know, be runnin around with mad fuckin cash
Who the FUCK wanna be an emcee
If you can't get paid, to be a fuckin emcee?
I came out my momma pussy -- I'm on welfare
Twenty-six years old -- still on welfare!
So I gotta get paid fully
Whether it's truthfully or untruthfully
With my Boston bloodthirsty posse
P-E-A-C-E



Move em in move em in
Move em out move em out
Stick it up {*whip sound*} raw hide!


Yea, gotta come back to attack
Killin niggas who said they got stacks, cause I don't give a fuck
{*inhales*} I wanna see blood, whether it's period blood
Or bustin your fuckin face, some blood!!
I'm goin out my FUCKIN mind!!
Everytime I get around devils {*breathing hard*}
Let me calm down, you niggas better start runnin
Cause I'm comin, I'm dope like fuckin heroin
Wu-Tang Bloodkin, a goblin, who come tough like lambskin
Imagine, gettin shot up with Ol Dirty insulin {*sucks air*}
You bound to catch AIDS or somethin
Not sayin I got it, but nigga if I got it you got it!!
WHAT?!? {*echoes*}


Yo, check the bulletproof fly shit, strong like thai stick
Then I'll remain to tear your frame, while I freaks it
Like some fly new sneaks and shit
Now EAT my shit, bitch tried to creep and got hit
Now regulate, and I'll be out to set up a date
Wu-Tang, is bangin like a Ron G tape
RZA pump the shit just like a shotty
Watch me run it John Gotti
Collidin on the track, like gin and watty
Check the calender, I warn any challenger
To step up {*whoosh*} feel the blast from the silencer




Comin soon to a theatre near you it be the Wu
Yeah find yourself in the square and see it's true
Actual facts to snack on and chew
My positive energy sounds peace to you
A wise man killed one horse and made glue
Wicked women puttin period blood in stew
Don't that make the stew witches brew?
I fear for the eighty-five that don't got a clue
How could he know what the fuck he never knew?
God-Cypher-Divine come to show and come to prove
A mystery god that's the work of Yacub
The Holy Ghost got you scared to death kid boo!!


Yeah, we always gotta keep it fly
Fly for you to feel, what you wants to feel
See Wu-Tang'd like to thank, all the people across the country
All the people in America, all the people outside of America
For listenin to our music
We gotta keep it fly for ya
See this ain't somethin new
That's just gonna come out of nowhere, no!!!
This is somethin OLD, and DIRTY!!
And DIRTY!!
Yeah..




Do you know where you going to?
Do you like the things that Lex serving you? But Lex'll murder you


A truck Acura, crazy, heavy tuck style, Dutch style
All my niggas look rich, all the bitches fuck loud
Seeing a Benz and look sizzling, don't let it rain, daddy
That's when the reds get more busy
Hyper and shooting at snipers, bloodbaths, some, they laugh
Gleaming in some luxury labs, all the wally down, flicks we flash
Grabbing bitches blowing in whips, every blessing, flip up flags
I put that on my wallet, I'm great, kid with the Purple Tape
Claim names, the Louis Lex Diamonds and the makes
All the bank robbing niggas pump aids, jewelry glass
Commission the mass, to stop the record, pa, switch plates, yo
Real niggas get big, fake niggas get hit
Talk about bitches won't come to your shit
I'm throwing on balley's, laying in denalli's
On my way to Cali, fuck niggas I respect, gun playing the slip


Real ain't real no more, yo these niggas is fake
Ever stared in the eyes of a snake?
To all my real niggas keeping it street, fuck running your mouth
If it's war, then we talk the heat
Hitting off, leaving bastards dead, watch his body collapse
And push his brains to the back of his head
And y'all niggas gon' respect the God, and the word of the streets
You niggas wanna see Lex go hard


I sing liver than the Ten', sitting in the V, choking my hat down
Everybody fly, folding bricks
Once my niggas get on, it's on, I'm popping niggas off top
This is my yacht, stay the fuck off
Ya'll ran with the Cuban, started changing names, nigga listen
I started it, you need to just pass me the chain
Don't give me that "I respect your work" bullshit
I shot the same game, shot niggas in planes and stole niggas wizzes
Yo, that's my ninjas, catching bodies a hobby
Sit back, doola hits, more, listen
Twisting, wrist glisten, slang lord, handle my position
Is to sit back, and kill all fake niggas
And I sware my ear is the rear version
Don't got time to kill on every track, fuck rap, change the wheel
Kneel behind 'burbans, and burst one knee, this is me
All the kid ever wanted was more burners










Ay yo I think like 1000 bucks
Run outside, buy 1000 trucks
Don status to 1000 fucks
Love my girl, love life, hug right
Im jumping in the wrangler white, what a world
Hugged in diamonds like Im Snow White, my bed is furs
We pull up in the what ups, we up son
Hugging my finger, all glean, all mean
More light like Edison, the better it seem
Just a realer Gz, rolling some killer leaves
Flashbacks when the king scoops you in the Philippines
Riding in limos, getting brick money MOs
Put a whore right in her place, smack your dentals
Toast to getting paper patsy, yes Im straight don
You could say the rate great Gatsby
Sly as ever, new level, who whatever
Blue bezel, desert boot on, golden medals
Real legends carry weapons, I walk through flexing
Watch the bomb drop, spit game detection
Dressed up arm in a splint, me and my woman
Thats my limp, she been right there holding my gimp
Come on ride baby, roll out
Lets fly through the globe now
Call it the Chev show, sold out




The illest nigga breathing, cops shift for no reason
Rock shit that dont drop until next season
Next season I rock what was dropped last season
I be fucking their head up, catch me out in Vegas somewhere fucking this bread up
And we was in the same lane until I sped up, dead up
You talk beef, I talk lettuce
That kinda explain just where my head is
Dollar sign language, were Rosetta
I first met her in bullshit V
She cracked a smart remark, I bet this dont take 93
Whether she knew or not, I was bluffing her
I really couldnt tell and thats why I fuck with her
All black Caddy truck like the governor
In front of her friends I scooped her and her mother up
Pool punch try to linger round, they offer weed
But my niggas dont smoke that garbage
We only smoke the grade A, best from the harvest
A few Menajes, new Ferraris
Just another day at the office
Shopping sprees in a plain white T
Why the fuck with a nigga like me
We some realer Gz, puffing on some killer leaves
You know what a nigga mean

Rollie what's up son Noodles had a problem

Yeah you know it, Bobby told me before
Keep the heat by the side of the door
Ready for military war
Numerous cats, niggas is uterus

Big safes out in Beijing

Bagged my man Chaz 32 bags he copped flight
Now he upstate baggin' niggas

That day we got guns on us
Jakes want us
Playin Einstein lenses and Auroras
Little meek caught us
Couple of francs, peep the blue Taurus
What up tuck your chain they came for us
Jumped out big nines and some hard bottles
Eyes of hate finally meeting up wid the stakes
It was who I thought it was
2 pair of Clarks one pair of Lugz
Wit the hardbottom nigga wid the snub
Cocked it, where rock at, stop that
Violate this cipher pa we'll definitely strike back
All of us right there slight fear in our heart
Blink we take it right there
Doing our thing apart
Broad jumped out tryin' to run shit
Spoken loud words all we want is his head
He did some dumb shit
Beef from Miami now
Damn yo big head Lance in some wild shit
Noodles caught the stair down
Now it came back to me yo
Handle it wise and brutally yo
Put down your tooly and talk like men
No shots rang yo, hittin' the ground like mangoes
Swiss cheese the thirty-G dorango
Few weeks later son seem 'em all..
I mean 'em all..

Hook

"I'm two blind to -- see the light"
"A fool can't -- see the light"
(Yeah... uh-huh)
"A fool can't -- see the light"
(Yo.... yo....)


Portable DATs, Sony headphones
El Dorado's, thousand dollar bottles, get blown
Dippin' at Willie's, Millie Jackson chicks
Dusted out Blondie, slide me, we wrote the bowl, we take the magnets
Man handling the mics, wool scarves, Evil Knievel bikes
I like eggs in my rice, circus money, read the Staten Island funnies
Eighty seven, Shallah rock, lotto's and the gumby
Tri-boro, fly negro, rap for Glaciers
Do it for cee-lo games, chasers
Battle for bitches, million dollar cribs
Grandfather gamble those wit ribs
Yes he did, life is wonderful, fly living rooms
Brass brooms, catch me in the city of wasps
Dusted out with Doc Doom, slide you in
Thirty six to the hip, you need Neo
Sock it to me G.O., the block we spot V.O
Live at the handball session, white Wimbledon's
Send them, my throat is the top session for men
Rap graduate, seen through the needles that was used by great
Fuck around and get rocked for three notes
And fuck your bitch ass alligators
When I see you on stage, throw out the gauge
My man's dough made it ---


Real nillaz do real things
Gold me'dal with the real bling
Ghetto child with the real sling
Throw the blaow, with the real aim
Hold it down for your nillaz, keep it real man
Lean back one time as you feel the liquor
Light a match, one time, inhale the ciga'
Blow the mack one time, when you kill a nigga
Real always gonna recognize real, my nilla


I hold it down with vets, make threats and take like chess
Blow cess to sets, break life sweats
Rep from the home of chrome, in eight flight steps
Town houses, white grams, brown ounces
After school drug deal courses, pound counslers
Round thousands, rubberband, black accountants
We them hood prowlers, live pushers
Try to hook the stripper, before they wipin' out they eye boogers
Stampede, nailed him, Sonny, Bronx Tale
Them locked the doors, he's home, now you can't leave
OD'ing in the Kennedy suite
Too hot to think, move for my enemy streets
I don't sleep cause the drama might catch you on the beauty nap
It's doobie rap, feds want you with a boobie trap




"Ooh I'm too blind -- I see the light"
"A fool can't -- see the light"
"A fool can't -- see the light"
"But a fool -- a fool - can't see the light"
"Ooh I'm too blind -- I see the light"
"Ooh I'm too blind -- I see the light"
"But a fool -- a fool - can't see the light"
"A fool can't -- see the light"


Aiyo, elephant guns, mad ounces
Colorful whips, slapped up bouncers
Vouche, crawling like a unit
Fly fragrance, faceless, rarely out of spaceships
Many fakes got lynched, see all up on the graphic
Taylor made mortals, leanin' on suede walls, leather's on
Ballers, maybe Benz lensers, sprayin' out of sixes
Christmas money, vicious consolidated drama rip bitches
The rich version of back, side scraper paper
Wu belt makers, show & prove that all my shit match
Tri-colored diamond, foreign color five, all kinds of iron
Swiss cheese, yo, big boy, we giants


Aiyo, my niggas get dramatic
Pump shots, nine Glocks, semi-automatic
Blat, take that, from this lyrical fanatic
We can go to war, or just peep the diplomatic
For paper, I'm an addict






Im accustomed to getting fast dough
And chicks that hold work by they asshole
Standing by the pool in a bath robe
Bullet in your caesar  or your afro
Lookign at the don and the apple
Be the biggest prize if real niggas was raffled
You baffled, throw you off the scaffold
Or hit you with the scalpel like the doctor
Rap style proper, imminent gun popper
West side highway flyer, coke chopper
Only fuck with niggas that prosper
Bitch ass niggas love to gossip
Get highford, get Kennedy
Get your ass turned to a memory
Remember he, remember him
Play me nigga, youll never win



Reckless
Reckless
Reckless
All coocoo, all loco


You dont owe me nothing but real rap
Under the laundry bag is still wap
Shoot first, not from sideways, niggas is young boys
Ringers is OJs, blow crazy
Under the building, Poltergeist in it
Sucked in the low best with ice in it
Buy cars, running through Mars, snatch yo jewels and dip dodge
And dont make me whip, its sergeant now
Its rough in the 718
Roll out, 11 niggas, snitches gone bate
Were strapped in the max with the lifers and indoor cyphers
Do anything to kill more Nikes up
Wilding with the wolves in the woolriches
Mostly yall niggas hoes is hood bitches
Catch you in the flicks, know the game 456
We bubble cocaine with the quick

(Hook x2)

Reckless
Reckless
Reckless
All coocoo, all loco


We in the same game but its different endings
Yeah its polo but its different linen
Got a gun but never been on a mission with it
Seen crack but never been in the kitchen with it
Never caught a nigga slipping with it
You just rapping like a criminal
Im a criminal rapping, a 5 star general
Fuck fake niggas, the message aint subliminal
Better take your vitamins and minerals
You talk a lot and the bullets when Im the interview
So wutchu say now?
Free shit, got bullets to give away now
Free shit, you get down or lay down
But once you laid down you stay down
Cause thats 2 to the dome piece
Bullets in your hair like the phone piece

(Hook x2)

Reckless
Reckless
Reckless
All coocoo, all loco




Ight, now, this is how we gon' do this shit
Youknowhatimsaying? Niggas wasn't out in the streets back then
When was doing this shit son, youknowhatimean?
Yeah, check the story


I done flushed bags of powder down project toilets
You could of found of me on the steps dusted, unable to call it
Jums in my pocket, the rental was stolen, tapping pockets
On the local drug dealers, just to see what they holding
I know, niggas with crack viles stuck to they colon
The acid, done bubbled up, now they stomach's is swollen
That just, life in the hood, surrounded class, who we bag in our stash
The ultraviolet haze, we hit it and pass
We toast to the Ghost of old days, yeah, old ager hump
We rap renegades, must stay paid

 + (Ghostface Killah)
Get money (get money) Get money, Ghost (get money)
Get money (get money) Get money, Ghost (get money)


Big fluffed out gooses on, Stan Smiths
The housing cops can suck our dicks, we jumping out of convertible matchbox shits, next drip inhaling
Chilling, my throat frozen, my orange brick
Bottles of Cru', bitches with Baby Phats, they swinging ax
They singing, you still blinging, daddy, now bring it back
To smoke these rap niggas, honey, I'mma need a match
To bust the game wide open, I'mma need an ax
I juggle this, practice, smuggle heroin in the cactus
Keep it hood, I still go and fuck a fat bitch
Actress, slinging the backs of five Cleopatras
A cocaine Chef, I stretch money like elastic, nigga
My raps is bigger, dynamics with the muscle advantage
Jay Cutler on dust, when I blam shit




Yo, we been bagging since 18, kid, Polo Rugs on with gloves on
Rented cars, fronting on winning broads
Gum slow, half moon, leather pants, Avia' days
Keep your hands off my blunt and my waves
Benetton, Superman bomb, everybody in the lobby, we clapping
Hats on, protecting your moms, you know how we play
Spray something down if the team say
It's on, I dedicate my lines to the PJ's
Triple beams, Pyrex jars, smoking nickle weeds
All we did is look mad fly, icicle rings
Whatever homeboy, you want it? You could get your receipt
A little closer, you can sense we got heat, it's only me
Plus four other ill gangstas, we all anxious
To blow up your block and spank shit




Yo, I'm down for the get down, hit the town, sick the bloodhounds on 'em
I rip clowns, I flip pounds, I spit rounds
I'm on the prowl, my stomach growl, crushed by the crowd
Rush through Loud Records, drop mushroom clouds
I'm not a rapper, I'm spellbound, I melt down
Your G-Force, with heat walks
Free falling to a better money, bet he's hungry
Spread the honey, big head inside the Humvee
Mix lead inside my lungies, spend bread on my Dungarees
And such and such, Ghost plugged me with this slut
Bitch, don't hug me, bug me, I'm ugly when I fuck
I'm hard like a jungle hunter, bust off in Heather
Double cross me, lift your boss off your feet, 'course he's feather
Whatever, whatever, he cried indepence
Tennis players get fried, playing both sides of the ends
Keep your eyes on your friends, cuz they spy for the feds
Watch me rise from the dead, I got ties with the dreads






{*imitating Marley Marl}
I don't care who first or who last
I just know y'all betta rock dis at da drop of a dime, baby!
(Renaissance)
I don't care what chy'all say or what chy'all do
But you got to be finished befo' the music is through

I don't think they heard me, hold up
So here we go, now


It be the Midnight Maurader on the scene
Geographically earthed in a place called Queens
I was formed with my principles, way I displayed
When I used to cool out where all the other kids played
Cause I was way too ill, I would hone my skill
Go out in the park and let my chemicals spill
Right there, on Farmers Boulevard, I made my mark
Two dudes, brothers would dip from us, me, and NARCS
And then my legend would grow on the A-train line
Where rappers would gather
To see my blowin' nicks and dimes
It was me, Big Pete, Tanya, and Sir Ibu
When in the heat of the cypher, I was not liable
For all the casualties of the dutty MCs'
I split the train car like Moses did the Red Sea
Get it in your head, we gon' rock the dead
Night of the living MC's, the weak ones fled; c'mon Bus


Yo, yo, God body, wise intellegence
Smack niggas and wrestle with elephants
My beloved, respect my benevolence
Comin' like missles, the issue is this
Be the shit you can't rebel against
Then I sniff out you niggas that be hidin' in bushes  whassup?
And strangle niggas like poisonous octopuses
Shut the fuck up!
Back with hazardous weathers and blizzards
As I spit, stickin' out my tongue like an iguana lizard
At you corny niggas, Animal Planet rap, Wildlife
Stabbin' you in your back wild nice (Ahhhh!)
While I hunt and eat you niggas like food, leavin' you bleedin'
Beats rattle the speakers, like some buffalo stampedin'
If you don't understand what I'm sayin'
Lyrically I'm like goons
Acci-DENTALLY beating you like gorillas playin' (Ha ha!)
Bitches know when I spit, I be seducin' them
Countless money with diamonds that's buried in Jerusalem
The Renaissance {*echoes*}


{*imitating Marley Marl}
WHOOO, that Busta Rhymes right there
I don'- look like sendin' Raekwon in here
Where Raekwon at??


Squeezing Johnny Walker neck up in the Benzo freezing
The head-long cock block pumpin' is easy
Poison medals on my neck wrists and arms
Louie luggages is bronze, a big bag of D, Happy Kwanz'
Together we the Chi-Lites to twists of the O'Jays
One line from miss'll have you leanin' like roach spray
Poison up on holstery, my boys in Mrs., our choice
Booklyn, Shaolin whylin' in the Royce's
Old Gold at the Golden Globes, my robe hittin' the cement
Chef in the building, yep and he been
A thousand one goons at the Rumba
Certified clients, drug money and somethin' up giants
Yo, it's the Tarzan cocaine clan in the area
Guerrillas in Louie hats, the more, the merrier
Take mines, take a hundred 9's
We be runnin' out of rhymes, never bullets
Try to front and you mines, renaissance

(WHOOOOOOOOOO-WHEEE!!!)


Let me spaz, let me spaz (C'mon!)
Though they call me Weezy F., you gon let me pass
So ahead of my time with my next week ass
Money on the dinner table like, "Let's eat cash!"
And I do it for the killers and the hundred dollar billas
And from now on, I don't think you should stunt without a million dollars in the bank, I got money in the bank
Now throw yo' hands in the air if yo' pussy don't stank
You got a bullet and a shank, I got a bullet and a tank
I got fur in my boots, and the hoodie on the minks
Stop sweatin' me, you should follow me, I'm directing it
Other fools break it down, I be dissecting it
Ever since I made it up out of middle America
Everybody wanna be in my genital area
But you better stay away from my chemical barrier
Weezy, baby, straight out the Cesarean, nigga
(What's it called, man?) Oh yeah: "Renaissance Rap"


Man, I ain't gon give y'all my microphone no more!
Cause y'all tear it up when you get it
Lemme see who you have
Now, you have Q-Tip, you have Busta Rhymes
You have Raekwon the Chef, you had Lil Wayne on here
Man, I ain't givin' y'all my microphone no mo'
Cause y'all tear it up when you get it
I just said, get a lil' somethin before the beats go

Aiyo, aiyo
Take you back far nigga, go get the ganja
Pass me the wine, I do it on time
New style worthwhile, young child, get wild
Then I live foul, before I give you a smile
Do best, smoke cess, just rest, I confess
This style came stacked like packs of Guiness
Wait, hesitate, watch the shit sound great
Then debate, nigga tapes, so now you all had a plate
Before I let go, like the funk freak flow
But soon to be true, cuz my style is crazy new
Never said old, cuz it's never been told
Foulin' up on the mic, get me, hell no
You beggin' and please to see me, flip keys
You brag about show off, achoo, I sneeze
This the shit that got everybody rockin' heat
Lex Diamonds, C-Muska son, lets take the streets




Yo, yo, yo
I stay gifted, stay lifted
Roll one up, son, I stay spliffted
Bring your boys in, I poison your district
We be the misfits, scientific Wu (straight up, man)
Yeah, them niggas, wit triggas on your hitlist
Drop ballistic, warheads, you kissed it
Sip the Mystic, it's liquid liquid
It's rigid rigid, it's cold frigid frigid
Boy, you missed it, it's Chad Muska
Teamed up with the Wu Gotti hustlas
Body bust your shit, throw the rhyme
Touch down on the dime, then I nose grind off (pop off nigga!)
Show your shines off, blow your mind
I'll give it to you, just one more time
Then that's it, ain't nothin' stoppin' ya
The city's the playground, another obstacle




Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu (represent, oh shit)

Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu (yeah yeah nigga what)
Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu (represent, represent)

Don't let me tell ya'll again, bitch, straight up
I put all this right there, on niggas in H.T.M.'s son
Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo


All magazines lit, fly life we live
The lingo is to let, ya'll niggas know, how niggas rep
I'm set, lightin' the purple in a new jet
Triflin' work, let's murder everything that move on the set


Goin' back to basics, shit you catch case with
Style laced with, arsonic, before you taste it
Rap matrix, gemini's is two faced it, I heard Rob Based it
"Bad boys" retire out the game just like Mase did
Dish it out and take it
To where I'm bout to go and everybody ain't gon' make it


Blow shipments out the rap shit, clap shit
Most of us attack shit, mean Benz, ballin' wit the bad chick
Take over, quick fast, violate, slap shit
And every borough, state, town, prison, map shit
Makeover hoes that blow, they attract dick
Shine on my jims, glow, on the low, slap dick
To every mean queen clean, keep it black chick
My motto, CREAM, green bottle of the phat shit




"Brothers respect mine!" - Raekwon
(Uh, uh, what, for real nigga, step the fuck off?)


Aiyo, Ice Cream, real niggas in whips
Fur coats, Gucci boots and shit, fly honey dip
Streets and clips is what we live for, rub on the floor
Ox in the jaw, rockin' the four, rugged and raw
Righteous and more, we the gliders, the outsiders
Killa Bee hivers, the big boy drivers
The conivers, the four fivers, survivors
We the livest and carry the heaters, coke is in the meters
Six to eight seaters, circle the mind readers
Pumas, Nikes, and Adidas, hip hop achievers
Love hood rats and love divas, love money, love sex
Love vets, love weed and love wrecks


All in together now, follow me the Method
Raw individual, the enemy you slept with
No love here, no tender, love and care
But M.C.'s, I'm starvin', niggas best before
For consumption, for wack assumption
You can catch a bad one or somethin'
From shotgun, you know I'm pza-pza-pumpin'
Jumpin', thumpin', get crunk and
Drunk inside the function
+Uncontrolled+ with the +Substance+
+Beneath the Surface+ there's +Redemption+
For Bobby Digital +Supreme Clientele+ convention, +Nigga Please+
+Immobilarity+ they can't breath til they +Blackout!+
I used to write and smoke L's in the crackhouse
Pull your wig like a potato then I mash out
Check your ego at the door
Better wipe your feet before you step me, or it's yourz!






Yo whassup kid? How you, yeah
Straight up and down
This is the Chef comin out of Wu-Tang Clan

So what we gonna do right here son
Aiyyo matter fact son, I'm tired of these niggas man!
Word up!


Hey yo it's total devestation, for any MC that poses
I paint the town red with clips and dum-dums and bloodshed
The Fat MC, from the B-X
Vicious like a T-Rex, who slips into a three-X
Rappers fuck up, and end up, in the obituary
Don't know the meaning of real, check the dictionary
I got no time for conversation
Makin MC's run for the border like the immigration
A Puerto Rican villain who be dealin and illin for nothin
You ain't a playa, you just BLUFFIN
Point blank, we can even do this with gats and shanks
It's your selection
I can become President, without elections
I got mad connections, Fat Joe, the rap wizard
Brainstorms come in swarms, get lost in the blizzard
Word to mother I take your life
Sodomize your daughter, and make a widow out your wife
It's the relentless, nobody can check this
Fat Joe, you know The Yung and Resless respect this
.. to all the fake MC's


Ch-chk-BLAOW! Move from the gate now

Yo who gets wrecked on the spot? You get wrecked on the spot
I got this whole rap shit locked
Many MC's perpetrated, and gladiated
I'm number one so yo they hate it
Listen here suckers, you don't wanna meet the chuckers
It's the same motherfucker who said fuck the ruckus
Back in ninety-three, when everything was fine and dandy
I was the nigga puttin razors in your kids candy
Mad connivin, it don't get any worser
Best reverse them thoughts DISPERSE
Even if you get loud and curse
You don't put any fear in my heart
Don't even start, you get torn apart
Fat Joe, livin the life
Yo I get trife, and do a number on that ass
With the butcher knife - slice after slice, yea
Causin more destructional horror, than the AntiChrist
Niggas know the motherfuckin time
Joe represents B-Lawn, respect mine


Nigga respect mine, or anger the tec-9
Ch-chk-BLAOW! Move from the gate now
Nigga respect mine, or anger the tec-9

Pussy ass coward, rat face nigga
Snake in the grass, I would've gave my last dollar to blast you

You live one spot now, hungry starving, broke, still arguing, dissing 
I told you nigga, you can't stop my glow, my motto is arsonist
Guns is nothing, blunts we puffin'
Throw a bunch of dots on your head
Wipe that smile off, fuck you, yo
And I...


I see you every morning, outside the restaurant


In juniors we would bag bitches
Pull us, a little Nikes
I knew a bitch that spit your tuna--we was tight
Yeah we robbed niggas together
Trade chains, this the same thing
Yeah I pawned off my ring finger for four sweaters
I felt like a surfer, flying uptown
Bringing Cubans up: don't bring your man, he a worker
I stayed pollying for hours, drug talk
This is a thug's walk, you skipped out the door for flowers
Said I trust, should've threw my gun up and bust you
Everything I earned, I should've burned, I fucks with you
Wasn't loyal like oil, big coil
Crazy connected with a string I mad ringers who'd kill for you
But now you target, take my a little pig wet Audemars and time yourself fast, you started, boo

This niggas' a fucking girl
Bitch ass nigga





So you got the message?

Mmhmm

Waiter, waiter

Yes sir

Let me get a water

You want coffee?

Did I ask for a fuckin' coffee man? I asked for water man

Glad you could make it, Rae

Yeah

We need to talk

Come on my time is, my time is money man, get to the point

Alright, listen. I know it's a lot goin' on in the streets and, uh, the streets it talkin' about you boy

Mmm, they sayin' nice things?

Ohh, actually it's not nice at all. Uhh, you gotta be cool for a little while, gotta be cool

Gotta be cool

Yeah, you gotta be cool. And, uh, your boys? Tell them to be cool witchu

Yeah?

Yeah, because uh, Rae, I got a job to do Rae and, uh, if it comes down to it, don't think for one second I won't take you out of here, man

And why would you do that?

I got a job to do

So you gon' take me down?

Where you gotta go, Rae? You gotta, you gotta be easy guy

So, um, so since I know that you gon' take me down, well you know that it's a, um. It's a flip coin to that situation because if my back is against the wall, and you're tryin' to take me down and I'm forced to do what I gotta do to protect myself. And at the end of the day I will come out victorious, so, it's just gonna be a standoff




A resurrection morning
The light goes
The sacrifice
The glory of the Ghost controls the soul


Time to surrender your physical being
So I can hear, touch, and smell, and start seeing
Life as a precious gift given from God
So I can enjoy my seed and start healing these scars
Take this knife and push it through your windpipe slowly
Come on Lester Kane, you better show me
You a man of your word, fuck the criminal conduct
You gotta sacrifice your life or else your time's up
He took the knife, the look on his face got calmer
I watched him take his life like a suicide bomber


It's time to go, I made a promise and I'm a man of my word
Fuck it, I'm a G and my bond will never swerve
I dreamt about this time and this place and I swear I've seen it
Now I'm face-to-face with a death angel
Thinking about the lies that I took with no strife
Standing here holding a knife, now I'm 'bout to take my own life
But it's for a good reason
My spirit needs to be replenished so I offer my soul to be relinquished


Lifeless, his body left slumped in a chair
It was time to become one, but my mind wasn't there
I wasn't sure if I wanted to walk this corrupt Earth
Smell sweat instead of fear, give up my powers
Be a simple man, let alone a ruthless killer
Crime boss syndicate, another sinner
Murderer, take lives like mine's was once taken
Or leave my seed in this cold world, my heart's aching


Man up soldier, no need to back it up now
I'm in a large space, beauty queens feeding me grapes
Jewels all thick and clusty
Me, the father, and rusty
What's the matter talking about you're not sure anymore
Did you lie to your brother Kane or did I die in vain?
You don't wanna be a sinner but sinning is in your veins
You a general, love the life of running in the city
Pretty women, lots of money, doing anything you want
Think about it, me and you as one force
There's no limit to where we can take it
Time is ticking, jump up in my corpse
And be true living king that you are, you need to live again
So you can enjoy the fruits and shine like the stars
Drink the finest wines and dine on exotic foods
Help the people who never helped, dropping a little jewels
Son you hesitating - I didn't hesitate for you
When it was my time to go, I cocked it and showed prove


A resurrection morning
The light goes
The sacrifice
The glory of the Ghost controls the soul




See, the way to evil, balance equality in no man
For no man is good and bad at the same time
Either you good, or you bad
Yeah... damn
Yo, Rae, that's you baby?
Damn, man, I heard all these things about you, man
Boy I heard you been doing your thing, man
Wait, wait, let me tap them pockets, man, them pockets fat?
You know I'mma get mine, yo, Rae, baby, check this out
Yo, we done went through so many trials and tribulations, man

Always watch them people who lie to you, them people try and cheat you, man
Out your money, I told you, you ain't let me cheat you out your money
Shit, man, what? You gon' let another nigga cheat you out your money, boy, you crazy?
Aight, watch the tricks, baby, cuz the trick is a lie
And a lie is a thief, trust me, baby
Knowhatimsayin, now give me a couple hundred, man
Time to go do my thing, man, I'm going on the road
When you get, when you, yo, I already had the vision
Yo, Rae, I had a vision, I seen you, man
At the, at Madison Square Garden, and I just came through
And you said "Yo", and it was real, son, and you took the world by storm
They didn't understand it, cuz they didn't see that far
They couldn't see the forest from the tree
But Rae, I'mma tell you, it's your time, man
Go get that paper, man, you understand?
Get that paper, man, cuz it belong to you, man
Allah is the God, trust, keep Allah in your heart, brother
And you won't fail, trust me, always remember
How far the thou travel, thou travel as far as the dimension he could see
What you see? That's all I can say baby, watch the liar, watch the cheat
And watch the thief


We need more time, we need more crime, man
Damn, stop playing, what up nigga
Yeah, man, chill, stick around for a minute
There's alot of money out there
Trying to get alot of fold ups, captain
It's all real, lay the roof, I'll meet you there in a minute
Monkeys with the AK's is upstairs, stupid
It's all good, chill, close the cabinet, stupid
Relax, man, relax, you got shit showing, nigga
Aiyo, Chef, a nigga got all your jewelry on when you be out of town, my nigga
What the fuck is this nigga problem, son
Chill, baby... a lot of bread...
All you gotta do is stick around...




In the beginning, it's time for a new chapter
Twelve more reasons to die, after the laughter
It's relevant, the legacy lives on lavish
Ghostface Killah, return of the savage
In the beginning, it's time for a new chapter
Twelve more reasons to die, after the laughter
It's relevant, the legacy lives on lavish
Ghostface Killah, return of the savage


I ain't letting nothing live, horrific the ghost risen
Stigmata scenery ill visions of being villains
The taste of blood is left on my tongue
Walk through the valley of death
I see the reaper waiting with two snakes kissing
Can't believe they took my wife and my kids, and straight lynched 'em
Word to God, once I get 'em, I got 'em, the moments priceless
Decapitating heads like a journalist snatched with Isis
I want revenge now!
Spotted one of Delucas men, at a restaurant
Eating spaghetti, drinking on Dom Prignon
With two other goons laughing, probably joking bout the murder
I calmly approach them with the burner
When they realized the real live G was about to serve 'em
60 pieces blew through his jaw, closing his curtains
Now it's total chaos, the people running for they lives
The other cocksuckers tried reaching for their hammers
But they was slow on their draw so I blammed 'em
Taking they tops off like a convertible drop burgundy phantom
They say the taste of revenge is sweet, well let me see
Prepare the table for a feast, take a seat, now let's eat


In the beginning, it's time for a new chapter
Twelve more reasons to die, after the laughter
It's relevant, the legacy lives on lavish
Ghostface Killah, return of the savage

Beast mode, I'm resurrected, I hear the record spinning
Early 70s, New York Kingpins
And I see street life, the only life I know
I see Liberty, I see the motherfucking Verrazano
I see gangstas getting money, bitches acting funny
Stacks upon stacks, and not one nigga bummy
Something ain't right, these ain't the greedy streets of Italy
Where Logan and my seed? C'mon son, you kidding me?
Who's calling me? Who's looking for the killer with no face?
Who summoned me into this place? I need answers!
Behave chancellors, I'm a vigilante killer
No time for games and there ain't no nigga realer
Let's talk business, you don't wanna leak your own blood
State your name, before you get stretched like a rug!


As the Ghostface Killah and the infamous gangster Lester Kane came face to face for the first time, they reflect on the violent events that forced their paths to cross. A black crime family led by Lester Kane has made a violent push for supremacy against the surviving members of the Deluca clan, now residing in New York City. In attempt to thwart his adversary advances, Luther Luca, the head of the Deluca clan, guns down members of the Kane syndicate, as well as Lester's wife and son. The war escalates. In one fatal night, Lester and his men rob one of the Deluca clan social clubs, discovering 12 vinyl records hidden within a safe




Bubble Goose, smokin' bubble kush
The Uzis is navy blue, a couple coupes
Satan around, stackin' suckers, save the truce
Mansions before these niggas, we done, we deucin'
Crackin' fish in the Ritz Carlton, take a piss
69 floors up, sparklin' Cris'
Moneybags stacked in duvet sheets
Few strange freaks follow the Wraiths
Walk through the gates, nigga
Pyrex Cubano connection
New York Mexicans, they call us the team for smugglin' wet shit
The Al Pacinos of rap, yep, they planned it with me
Pass the baguette, gold Louis phone, hand it to me
Raised a million champs, this is our civilian's lamp
Furless sweats, stay in jets, kill a billion camps
Pussy niggas get strangled fast
Still I'm cool on the fast, rockin' the grill of glass
Desert boot on, countin' a million cash
This is all I ask for, love is fair war, let's build the masses
Sittin', boat sailin', scenic routes, catch the quotes
Young, armed and dangerous  couple posters
I'm like known in a couple coasts
Rae and Ghost, familiar with us? Raisin' ghosts


I'm hearin' how these niggas plottin'
Madame sleepin' on Egyptian cotton
Miles Davis vinyl still spinnin'
I've been to Freaknik, I've been livin'
You see the Bentley and we smokin' in the parking lot
Contract killers so we rarely talk a lot
Guiseppes and my weapon when you see me steppin'
10th grade education with a MAC-11
The definition of a renaissance
Twice a day I change watches, chains and the charms
Tatted on my back, chest and my palms
Then it's me and Diddy, dice games at the Palms
Blew a mil' in cash just to let the bitches watch
Take her down to the lobby, get the bitch a watch
Tinted windows, smokin' with a screw face
Black hoodies on, bullies think it's Wu-Tang
Barry White blarin' in the white Benz
Runnin' like I had a curly perm back then
It's Rozay and I'm 40 up
Pink Belaire in a nigga's cup


Ayo jumpin' out the shower, jewels on, heated up
Fluffy Polo towels in Melbourne, gettin' it
Hands is ashy, cash keep comin', dice hand like Lil Poo
Young god bowlin' with thunder
Bettin' bricks out at the Knicks came with Cubans from Biscayne
Burnin' the Castro cigars with a big flame
Godfather coats and hard bottoms
Everything down to cribs, hoes and gear, we got 'em
It's the lean team, Medelln chains
Shop niggas like fresh fruit, like old grand earth, can of green beans
We'll cut you and you and you, nigga
This is me, Rae and Rick; box-cutters on crews, nigga




Yo, it's me man, word up, yo


Who would of thought you would of slid
Half a million dollar crib, the future mother of my kid
Yo, you like queen bee and seen with a don
Yo, I never meant to do you wrong, never meant to hurt you, pa
It's my apology, probably don't accept it, do you
For them wicked minds, just let 'em know that Chef loves you
Think I'm cheatin' while I'm workin'
Understand this, this what I gotta do it, ma, my weight's worth it


Lately I've tried to pretend like there's nothin' wrong
See I've been, holdin' back these feelings so very long
Why is it this, fallin' apart?
Why can't we say that it's over, cuz baby it ain't the same


I, wish I could rewind the time
Back to the day I fell in love with you
It's something bout those happy days
I play back in my mind, oh, a thousand times
I remember when the love was true, oh
And I just can't take it any longer, but I loved you


Remember, I loved you, oh baby, I loved you
I wish I could rewind the time
To the day that, I loved you, oh baby, I loved you
I wish I could rewind the time


Strangely my love has just drained up and gone away
But yet I'm, cryin' for you, winin' for you, every day
Why is this, change in my heart
Why can't we say that it's over, cuz baby, it ain't the same






Do, you, ever think about the way
That we were so in love
Yes we were, but things have changed (my feelings have changed)
But I can't seem to let you go, oh no


Yo, just take a second and think, where would I be without you
Where would you be without me, type confusin', ain't it?
Paint a perfect picture, due to my occupation
Challenge the God, with false accusations
Your blow crushin' friends feedin' you lies
Tryin' to control us, they be misleading your mind
Reminiscin', say rewindin' the time, when my queen was refined
Play it back like a scene in my mind
Understand, yo, I'm workin' for us
Never knew you was home stressed, missin' my touch
I still want you, promise you, this time around, I'mma flaunt you
On tour, you can cop a flight if you want you
Let's bring it back, if it's over, I'll accept it and walk
If not, let's correct it and talk
Yo, we grown, so let's put away these negative thoughts
Yo, it's Chef signin' off, and forever get yours


Your love is all that I've even known, oh baby
I wish I could rewind the time, oh, oh
Oh, oh, whoa, no one loved you, like I loved you
No one loved you, like I loved you
No one loved you, oh no no no no no, no, rewind the time






Ayo Im done selling drugs and buying keys on consignment
Im about to buy a lab and purchase me a lion
Drug money is sucks, Im in the lux, drunk as a fuck
Be going hard, bitch ass your butt
But still in all I gain I dont know no other way
Im cooler than the M6 play
I run with drug niggas who ya one day
One pay, one K
Sun play, some spray
Half of these niggas underage
They came with the Purple Tape
Grape shit, some call it gray
I call it revolutionizing in the mix
My money He-Man now
Was shakin, dont fuck with them snakes
Fuckin with them fix hustle niggas is gay
If thats your thing, cold play
Dont get in my way
We got hack saws that smack jaws, betray me
Bout to get you more

The official just late, give him his way
Thats my nigga no big and give him his space
If they front on us we frontin' back, piss in his face


Peace to the god, whats up?
Lord Im laid in the cut
Laid in the cut with a slut
Laid in the cut on the peanut butter guts
With a slut with Brazilian, hair to her butt
Denzel cool, standing at the stove like "woo!"
Whippin that work like "woo!"
Ric Flair "woo!", Ric Flair "woo!"
Im penguin pussy cool
Sittin sideways in a brand new coup
Fuck nigga, suck dick til you strangle
Therefore hatin on a real ass G
Like me talkin bout you ass got ammo
Say fuck your gripe wit a nigga named Mike
Fuck nigga, yea Im a king in Atlanta
You dont wanna be a news story on the TV channel
Talkin bout last seen in Atlanta
Bitch I'll take your life, sleep good that night
Crack crab-legs in Savannah
Im so Tony Montana
Nose full of coke, M16, all black hammer
Put coke in the street, in a week everything jump back
Sweet, sweeter than a can of Fanta
Polo, Polo head-to-flo' ho
I got horses on pajamas
Yea, late night I might take flight
With 3 hoes like my name Santa
Yea yea, I drive a Chevy and I treat it like a Phantom
I bought a 96 Impala and I named it MJG
Cause we pimp hard and we pimp hard
And a bitch cant ride for free
Gone


Peace to the gods
Way to hit the breaks home boy
You about to fall asleep in the car
Run a red light on me motherfucker
Imma pull the Chevy over and reach in the glove
Speak from the blood kinfolk
You dont wanna see my pen, no
You dont wanna see me unplugged
If I pull a 9 out, overnight Ill sign out
You snug as a bug in the rug
Get a buzz on drugs and chug a jug-of-suds til I bust da' guts (Uh-huh!)
Man, I could make a deacon dirty when I speak
Im murdering, I make a mean-mug and cuss
When I lean in the Cut - lass
It's this "30 ought 6" swingin' outta that window
Tires in the mud (Uh-huh!)
Got the soul of an old man, I can feel the love
So call me daddy, lay my balls on the Caddy
Cause I drive 'em nuts
Dont follow and @ me if you ain't followin' rappin'
Cause Im about grinding plus
These songs that I write got life like a sycamore tree
Let it grow tall, get thicker, more leaves
Til the boys on the blogs are losing hair
Well let 'em go bald, just give 'em more weave
Yelas in the kitchen potpourri
Did I forget to mention Im an emcee?
Did I have to prove it on BET
In a cypher twice, well it just might be
I know
So, Radioactive had a couple of radio-attempts
But, I dont wanna be radio-active anymore now
Than I wanna jump off a cliff
This I promise
Catfish Billy, you can put Trunk Muzik in a picture frame!
You aint gotta tell me that I made a mistake, and some of that shit was lame
But all I wanna do is say "fuck that shit" and please accept my change
I was only tryna people-please
So people, please know my name
Now back to the metaphors
Its better for me to settle scores instead of more self-loathin'
I put tags on toes
And like Im in the morgue and Im giving no pedicure
Set a store on the corner sellin' melanol
Set sail on a pale horse with a sword
Yea me behold, in a white Caprice classic, pedal to the floor
Flying by the seat of my pants
Cause I need what I need
I believe that I can go achieve what I came to achieve
And I leave you and you with the new CD in your hands
Put it in, put it in, let the 808 fill that space
Any kind of high never feels this great
You can feel the taste, you can see that smell
You can touch the moon when you hear that bass
Thank God that I got this gift, damn right and I wont shut up
Let the gray hair fall down like an OG, damn right and I wont cut em
Man, Im on my shit
Life is a trip when Im jumpin over cracks in the road
Say what you want to about this white boy
But I know the truth and raps in his soul




And regardless to how much power you have
When God sends prophets and messengers
They don't care nothing about your power
Because they come from the power


Rare nigga, I'm a wonder
Your best success is my worst blunder
Feds tap the number
Jewelry Jacqueline Onassis could appreciate
Weed to alleviate the pain
Eddie Kane, Richard Pryor pinky ring
Watch your conduct nigga
Throw parties for my niggas thats living, you guessed it
Models yall keep them if they anorexic
Love em but cant trust them
Hate em but wont bust them
Caking in savings, spending, wasting
It's like a custom
Tats are hieroglyphics
Lipstick on the collar
I got more to lose than you do but Im a rider
When did the rules change
Yall living trendy on pennies
Meeting deadlines with ease, no game
You fire, I'm butane
Gator Timbs, ostrich belts
These be the times that I surprise myself
My niggas looking like black crows and packed shows
The Don voice stay pristine like I'm still seventeen


I'm rich, Black, African
Rocking the golden Mack
Shearling leather, Gucci leg it's on my back
Willie Bosket hoodlum in the trench
Rinse these niggas
'86 Cazals dicing near the fence
Mike Tyson disciple
Trifle with my pen, it's a rifle
Sixteen ways to shoot you through your Chrysler duke
Exhaling with niggas, the jails argue
Bring the best niggas to the table
I'll sic all my whales on you
Custom wooden speakers rock Alices, rump on polices
Dump on creatures, holidays and preachers
Stainless steel watches, ostrich turtlenecks
Here's the deal
If we can't come in, they can't have the field
Bones in Cisco', murder instrumentals
Cayenne Porsche rap, how many horses live official
I run with generals who flash Uzis in interviews
My shit is deep, we fly, swiming, dude


Verse two gotta be all murder-like
The first verse
Timbs yellow like the hair on a Malibu surfer
Yellow like my Harry Winston glistening arm B
Yellow like New York City piss-stained concrete


Thats right, yo, who voted toasting in the wind
Las Vegas Otis
What you know
Leave it right here we ghost in the Lotus
Put a package on your head, be promoted, keys in effect
Paying these dumb fucking Ds off with donuts


I hate, to see you, acting like a slave
To get an advance here, an advance there
Because somebody else controls your destiny


Aiyo, Im rich, Black, umbrella calico captain
Wes Craven with a blade and a black
Im hood ornaments
Junkies win awards in my tournaments
My shit is listed like informants pics
You know we order hits
Planes flying, niggas is sure to get you
Whether in Costa Rica, Lisa, she sure to twist ya
Eating Chow Lo Mein with chopsticks
Glocks with aim
Watermelon chips, pop some pagne
For all the riches
Niggas forcing out they feelings, kid
Whether in hallways or the boats, now feel us, kid
Out in Alaska, in the Astons, remember my passion
Hungry wolf who never eat in his castle
Bolivian connects restless, yeah
Chef ambidextrous
Quick to back you in like the Lexus shit
Hunted by the FBI
We gracious, more demonstrations
Shit is tough, milk the Carnation






Now, '94 to '95, innocent without crime
Drop that shit


Yeah, yeah, check it out
Now run for your life, or you wanna get your heat, whatever
We can die together
As long as I send your maggot ass to the essence
I don't give a fuck about my presence
I'm lost in the blocks of hate and can't wait
For the next crab nigga to step and meet fate
I'm lethal when I see you, there is no sequel
24/7, Mac-11 is my people
So why you wanna end your little life like this?
Cause now you bump heads with kids that's lifeless
I live by the day only if I survive
The last night, damn right, I ain't tryin' to fight
We can settle this like some grown men on the concrete floor
My slugs will put a stop to your hardcore
Ways of action, I grab the gat, then
Ain't no turning back when I start blastin'
Pick up the handle and insert the potion
Cock the shit back in a calm like motion
No signs of anger or fear cause you the one in danger
Never share your plans with a stranger, word is bond


I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you


Fuck where you at kid, it's where you're from
Cause where I'm from, niggas pack nothin' but the big guns
Around my way, niggas don't got remorse for out-of-towners
Come through fronting and get stuffed with the 3-pounder
The loud sounder, ear ringer
And I'm a point the finger, at all you wannabe gunslingers
You got a real ice grill but are you really real
Step to the hill and I'ma test your gun skills
Cause real niggas don't try to profile
You just a chump who needs to get drunk to buckwild
But swing that bullshit this way
And I'm a make your visit to the bridge a motherfucking short stay
Queensbridge, that's where I'm from
The place where stars are born and phony rappers get done
6 blocks and you might not make it through
What you gonna do when my whole crew is blazing at you
With macs and tecs to lend to get your dome crush
You thought that you could come around my way and beef, stupid fuck
What the hell you smoking? What the fuck possessed you
To come out your face, now I have to wet you
Throw on my Timbs, black mask and black serpent
Twist a nigga cap, then jump in the J-30




Who's the richest nigga in the project, who got it locked
Rocking Convertibles, drop tops and mad hot
Peace to that whiz kid and playas on his team
Who's organized, all eyeballs is on CREAM
And your whole clique got nothin' but raw shit
Whip after whip, stay flashing your dick on tricks
Your whole crew's ravishing, team's untouchable
In the jungle, banging NaS, Mobb Deep and Wu
There's money out there, guns catch crumbs, those are your sons
Jums is in the mailboxes, bitches holding your guns
You know what's out there, thousands of gram, wrapped in Saran
Sealed tight, keep the freshness, that's how we expand
Masked Avenger, drop your gun, son, now surrender
Get ninjaed on the island, plus the Bridge, boy remember


My little thug's selling drugs and he's struggling
The game got him bugging, I tried to tell him slow down cousin
But he vexed and niggas getting wet up in the projects
But with no doubt, shorties out for his respect
But is his brain insane from the lye?
From smoking that 118 tiny tye
Why, a nigga just died last week
As he swore he was grown and he's a thug in the street
But it's like that, my crew pump cracks and we pack mac
His eyes is wild with the rezzy monkey on his back
But I'm stressed and he need to be blessed
With a firepack, don't even go there cause it ain't like that
Slow down baby, he said, what, you trying to play me?
You must be crazy, pulled out the heat and almost blazed me
Then he was Swayze, the shot must of dazed me
Thug selling drugs, busting slugs, but he ain't crazy




Nobody can't stop our rain
I don't bend, I don't break
Too much dough to ever go broke
Too much champagne to use flutes
I'm straight from the bottle like a genie hoop
Grant you death wishes
I don't dance, I just do this
Burn it down, I smell Piff
I post it up
Like an advertisment for a gangsta flick
She like that, I'm smoother
She's used to dudes trying to seduce her
I tell her straight up let's move towards the exit
So I can put her high-heeled shoes up
On the roof of the hard head coupe
She want me for me, and you for loot
You goof troop, I'm all
Throughout the globe, you're a local star
Stay in your lane and get folded
Wrapped up like tour bus promotion
You're a flop, when your album drop
It's like dropping a brick into the ocean


Daytime drama, niggas get soaked
Washed up good, blood stained clothes
I'm OD reckless
Out of left field my team'll just wet this
You ain't gotta like it but respect it
You ain't gotta fight it, just let it
What's good, everything Gucci 'til
I gotta give to them raw like sushi bill
Get his coofie pill
I'm that nigga, bitches choose me still

Left my penthouse with a swollen jaw
I'm everything you can't be it's hopeless
Like a penny with a hole in it, oh shit
Worthless, and I'm just perfect
On purpose, Hav at your service


Any towels out there B?
Bring your album out
Come on B
I'm foul with a gorgeous neck
Dusted and style, a half moon
...protect me
Bruce Lee glasses in the Aston
Sipping a half a glass of Coke
Wile out for last year
Money stronger, Benz longer
Jetting to the Teeter Barrel
Two sprinters along
Ghost catch me in your pocket
Other than that, up in the stockage
Wool ridge jacket on the pop
No funny money, my bunny Colombian
Thick back, grey eyes, and she got no stomach
Pull out the wiper and sweep
Drop it out the window
My kin'll blow you right to sleep
We professionals, grabbing our testicles
Who wanna battle, bring your burners and geckos
I'm sure to have fun on you young niggas
I'm not a hater, or can't stand on my man to man 'em




Nobody can't stop our reign
I don't bend, I don't break
Too much dough to ever go broke
Too much flow, I'm not no fluke
Too much champagne to use flutes
I'm straight from the bottle like a genie hoop
Grant you death wishes
I don't dance, I just do this
Burn it down, I smell Piff
I post it up
Like an advertisment for a gangsta flick
She like that, I'm smoother
She's used to dudes trying to seduce her

The Chinese have a saying: "Dangerous men will meet in narrow streets." And so it was. We were raised between the clans, and that meant pressure on me to make more weapons. And as word of the gold shipment spread, strangers suddenly appeared in jungle village


 Machete still stainless
The archbishop run from the narcs
A crisp biscuit plus play the harp, wrist glisten
Goon captain, catch me in Africa black down with 4 5 Somalians
Black Tims, rubber suit Wonder Woman bangle a blue coupe
I'm usually upon the roof countin' mad loot
Root beer reefer, teeth frame, doin' my 1, 2
Smokin' with a plain Jane trooper
Excellent with rifles, out in Japan
In a flight goose switchblade that poke out the Nike boots
Thrusted on a bullet train with chains on, gettin' my train on
Thunder money, make bread, brainstorm
All this is made for the Forbes list
Broads get pissed, say "Yo he fucked me out his drawers he dissed me"
All this is calculated, the Batman with a black hand
Mafia money, killas who rock tans


Bone crushing, smooth kicks, blades choppin' through bricks
Masters of the weaponry, sells to both cliques
Blacksmith, with the iron fist
X2


Rigor mortis, I watch the body rot to the bone structure
Scrape out your brain, watch your eyeballs rupture
Black magic, leave your fuckin' skull in a soup pot
Makaveli, Vamoose like 2pac
Suicidal tendencies, down the white Hennessy
Look in the book, I'm the definition of menace b
Chokin' niggas out for no reason, it's duck season
I'm cold as ice, 6 degrees below freezing
Stay dipped, rock a striped shirt like Freddy Kreuger
You'se a baby piranha surrounded by barracudas
Seven thirty, I'm more like 6 o' clock
Straight up and down beatin' up niggas till there's blood in they socks
Ox em, duff em', stuff 'em in black bags
Without gettin' no blood on my fresh rags
Ruthless, heart of a stone, grown with no emotions
I piss out brewhas, poisonous potion




Yeah, it's the three deadly venoms with weapons in the denims
Some shit that'll shake windows and break lay tenants
Come left field, aim crooked and straight blaze in em
Have you niggas with straight-legs with a fake leg in em
Wolf in sheep's clothing, eyes scoping a tender lamb
Spin you bitches like a ballroom dinner dance
G-Mode dress code got suspender clamps
Russian roulette, money bet, go and spend your chance
You little fleas get killa bees and army ants
EMS cut up your jeans like zombie pants
Hollow chrome to your collarbone
Ping against your dome piece and sound like the first key on a xylophone
Grown men discussing death and the malice tone
See how quick the smiley faces turn solid stone
Ghostface, Rae and G be the wildest known
We straight street, we keep seat in the palace throne





LIVE GOOD


Yeah, 5 seconds of fame that's all it takes, man
The grass might look green, I watch the snakes, man
Put a couple 0's in my bank statement
Then hire a lawyer to look after my estate plan
Yeah, so I can plan my vacation
Somewhere I can get tan and have relations
With my Tunisian girl, yeah she super hot
Super luxury - breakfast is on a super yacht
The terror of the French Riviera
Rolling down the strip I'm in that rare Carrera
Pose for the haters when I pull up at the cross walk
The whole club sold out to hear the boss talk
And we gon' shut down the city tonight
My homie Sheed 'bout to spend about fifty tonight
So if you and your girlfriends get pretty tonight
We gon' show u what good livin is like


So I'mma live hard
I'mma dream big
Cause in the end, homie
I'm just tryna live good
I'm just tryna live good
Do it bigger than anybody else ever did
Cause in the end, homie
I'm just tryna live good
I'm just tryna live good


I'm black and successful I guess I beat the odds
The rare chance a mortal could actually beat the gods
I took that chance, believing I could win this
Take my seat on the throne - the peak of Mount Olympus
I'm slipping the day it turns cold in Hades
SLR McClaren yea that's the old Mercedes
It's catching the eye of every bystander
Lanvin to fly - call that high standards
At the border know I'm asking for trouble
The customs officer found 30 stacks in my duffel
I said I'm partial to nice uniforms on a chick
She let me off with a warning but she wanted a flick
The by-product of celebrity
She don't even know who I am, but she'll remember me
So I reinvest in a fan for longevity
Caught up in the fame - that's where I'll never be




Yo I ran through the park some nights, holding cocaine
No ID - Im lonely in this cold game
Once I get back on my feet I gotta a family far away
Somewhere in Dubai and it's deep
Coconut water and spliffs fly honey bunnies
Wrangler jeeps, 6 hundred horse sonny
Listening to Big and Pac
In a world where they kidnap your girl and bitch smack your pops
Im all about more commas, Fisker Karma
But Im stuck on a bench in a bomber
A ski hat a pair of these Lees, Im wearing these trees it be that
Quick fast to blast for Gs
Never been nothing but a street king
Now let the beat bang, gimme a mic check my mean swing
Sooner or later we large and I'll glance at myself
Biggin' shit up you know who started it






{*whispering*}
Eh yo.. eh yo
{*speaking normally*}
Ice Water (yeah yeah)
Don't get it twisted
We'll shoot yo' ass, nigga
Haha (P.C., nigga, P.C.)
Y'all mothafuckas got about fifteen seconds to live


Yo it's a new year, bitch, and I'm takin' over
My whole crew here, bitch, and the game is over
Niggas, talkin' faces, soldier
If rap don't work, get back to that bakin' soda
On the strip tryin' to catch more cake than Oprah
I got clips that'll leave you with ya face on a poster
I talk slick and I'm sprayin' the toaster
Sparkin' shoot outs and start poppin' off shit the way I'm supposed to
You the type to go up North straight scrappin' a sore butt
And ain't nuttin' worse than gettin' shot as soon as you woke up
You got work? I'll be rapin' ya dolja
I'm takin' his pack and breakin' his back and makin' him throw up
Cuz the draft's like a bomb and I'm waitin' to blow up
I'll take cash on ya mom's and turn her frame into donuts


Yo.. yo.. yo
Eh yo I'm blazin' hot, never haze or flop
Wanna battle? Name ya price, I'mma raise the pot
Put ya car on the line, I'mma take ya drop
Put ya jewels up, I'mma take ya chain and watch
It's like I hard ball and you, play soft
Just call me the Hitler when I spit about eight off (Adolf)
Shots'll rip ya face off, nigga ya heard me?
Beat you black and blue like a Hitman jersey
P.C. never been known to play games
I spray things that'll re-arrange ya brain
I cock and aim, miss you then pop ya dame
Only reason that I came through's to lock the game


Yo it's time to die, who you gon' run to?
Who you gon' call when them dogs come confront you? {*barking*}
You stand firm or be the bitch that you is?
Would you grab the guns or run to the pigs, you mothafucka, huh?

Lookin' stupid with a vest on, these bullets might draw on ya face
They call me Alexander Sean the Great
Cuz ya bitch said she love the way the dick talk all in the cake
I need this bank money, throw me the safe
All these killas involved, the cops'll fuck around and chalk the place
Yo they wonder why we hang with crooks
Shit is take free, not used to money off the books
Broke faggot nigga caught in a juks
I'm a pirate in this rap shit, I leave you niggas off the hook


What the fuck you gon' do when we run in ya crib?
Either we leavin' with the bricks or we gon' leave with yo' kids
And we only got hours to live
So give up the ransom or find they ass up under the bridge
'Lite never been afraid, so keep lookin' niggas
Cuz I'll rob yo' ass faster than some Brooklyn niggas
Yo this rap game twisted, everybody beefin
Everybody killas now and ain't nobody leakin
Smoke a lot of weed so I don't like to fight
But I might go upside ya fuckin' head with a pipe
Got a bulldog, not only do he bark he bite
Give a fuck about a hood, it ain't safe at night
You fucker!




I'm tellin' you, man
Young motherfuckers, man
Y'all niggas is really fuckin' pissin' me off
Who you gon' run to?
Who you gon' fuckin' call when I put this motherfuckin
Fo'-fo' long in yo' motherfuckin' mouth, boy?
Haha (Shot in yo' face)

(Call the cops) Uh-uh, uh-uh

Hey lil mama, I got some of that Bon Jovi
You know me, I'm flying in the air like living on a bird
We're on the corner serving that rock'n'roll, rock'n'roll, rock'n'roll
Posted on the corner with the rock'n'roll, rock'n'roll


Willie Nelson nigga, we run flusty, crocodile hat
Cowboy rap, hammer game trusty
Diamonds on from Ghana, Boca retire in a yacht
With the middle name Lex, pop my llama
Movies get made in HD, let me get your eighty-three
I'mma scout faces so straight meetings
There's nothing you can do with my real niggas
Not the ones I rest my head with, my son a real crew piranha
Two wheels scooters, the new Rugers, floating through the Beverly Center
I count a ten up with my shooters
All these is high powered, Bob Dylan style, my niggas
Post it up, yeah frontin' at Mr. Chow's, titanium hustle, switch color
Most of them rich brothers are only on fucking and switch nuggets
Luggage is the real shit, who kill shit niggas is nothing
Blow a blunt, repeal shit


Hey little mama, little mama, I got some of that Bon Jovi
You know me, I'm flying in the air like living on a bird
We're on the corner serving that rock'n'roll, rock'n'roll, rock'n'roll
Post it on the corner with the rock'n'roll, rock'n'roll
Hey little mama, have you ever took a hit of Mick Jagger
Yeah, better will blast ya now take it hit of this rock'n'roll, rock'n'roll


Yo, everything platinum, even my baggage
You want a platinum rock? Then go see Larry
He got the yellow hat, yellow Maxes Air, looking like me
With a yellow back, pretty long hair
Suck a dick like Karrine Steffans
With Bobby Brown on speed dial, his ex dial stay on the check-in
I got that Mickey, baby, little mama
I got the bomb, call me Tom Brady
Move like a running back, 21 Tomlinson
Know how to push it back, you should pay homage and
Shit is too potent, make you feel like vomiting
Your black/white birds can give me five like Donovan
Pop the champagne for the illest hustler in the game
I got the Pink Floyd eyes on all day
And I ain't even mention my deals yet
Cuz I don't wanna have you freaked out over this real shit




All stand up, we in the building, let the birds fly
Rock star to my heart, anything else? Uncivilised, go
Rock star like the Red Hot Chili Peppers
I can't front red tops got me feeling extra
I drop the top so I can show the stones
I got the sour so I'm Rolling Stones
I'm popping shit on my mobile phone
I never slip cause I keep the fully loaded chrome
And have my niggas even stay 
That's why we pour a liquor for the Grateful Dead, we miss you
Where I'm from, it's either guns or roses
And fuck with me you need a bunch of roses
And Lord knows is keep the led zeppelin
A nigga put it then we dead ressing
You can tell a bitch is still an e
We got that white girl nigga Sheila E
Diplomats we the eagle(Killa!) we finna be greater than the Beatles






Aiyo, Rockstars, bases and capers flying through cases
With placed bread, lead blowing through domes, scalped faces
Moving through towns, skama lit, nations bend stations
Dope fiend Asians, smoke cream vanquishes
The town is thirsty for work, blood hurting
Flash the curtain, open, I'm scoping, Hutch and his team
Clutching Dutches Backwoods, other shits working, not perfect
Flipping discussions, cussing all froze with slush, kid
Lacer had the drop, pass the Glock, Woosie uzi
The car hard bluesy with the pay me mean 'Bach
Cream shot, clean slot, one in his dome, four shock
He partially zoned, his dome fell on the rock
His face dazzle, niggas baffle, son, hit the floor, he traveled
Yo, to a new land, I cracked his cerebellum
Wide open, open the crowd up, he fouled up, black laid in the hall
For like forty-five to an hour, soaking


Sound of the smoking barrel, live like them older stars
Scrooge like a Christmas Carol, stemmed from a bloody love
Shot through the old apparel, no police to respond
Dropped off the Verrazano, washed up On Golden Pond
Just like a Shakespeare novel, more problems to dissolve
If this is destiny, that's how this world revolves


Aiyo, it's real, better pop your steel
Cop those wheels, shop those deals
Full time with the grind for a meal
Stay down low like O'Neal
Rain, hail, snow or shine, put time on the field
Police ride on my heels
Still big time, big dime, how you feel
I rhyme but the nine stay peel
I, zone on roam, floss with the chrome on chrome
Host on the corner store
S.I.N.Y. on my own, it gets foul, but I call it home
Live red bone give me dome, champagne toast to Tone
Roll a bone, a homegrown with Capone
Cause more rips to the o-zone, wanna ride with a nigga then hold on


The place was very smokey and cloudy, the full lousy
Music was emotional, people vibes was laid back and far from rowdy
She sit at the bar, holding a glass, sipping on a drink
Tears flowing like water from a sink, her eyes never blink
Her cigarette was burnt to the butt, her wrist was wearing a cut
Her facial expression was saying "now what"
Another drink was made, each and every time the bass was played
Bartender telling her to go, but then she only stayed
Riding on the borderline, between homicidal, suicidal
Just hours from the headlines, the story with the grim title
She questioned her reason for being here, but even with
Four kids at home alone, it still remains unclear
Opens up a bottle of prescribed drugs and grabs a mug
Down, every one of those pills, since she was feeling bugged
Kinda weak, she stumbled from her seat, but she will never return
I guess it must of been a, lesson to learn








Go head..


Give me all Gucci colors, my niggas get real for brothers
We idolize big lines and nines
Jumping out of big joints live, projects
Lot of objects, front if you want, you gon' die
Lex with a sawed off, Killah gonna tax him in the Waldorf
All bloodhounds, pop, show it off
Actin' like that money ain't live
Built it from the getty-up, New York City gonna fry
Aiyo, son, I take mines, rape lines
Yeah, I'm realer than Rikers who orchestrate great crimes
Jump out the Lex', lookin' zesty, real Nestle
What, picture nigga, except bless me
God, I'm high-powered, gun of the hour, crafted Flowers
Give it the blend, double it, and blow like the Towers
All ya'll need to take showers, can't take what's ours, pa..
Been sellin' crack, been sellin' crack
Been sellin' crack, livin' the black
Revealin' how we flip that, strip cats
We write rich raps
Help out the body
Me, similar to the Gotti story
I'm kinda young, son, a fly forty
The Reverend cold shittin' on shorty, did it to shorty pop
And gave him like ten in his jaw piece
Remember this sayin': "Staten Island Gun Slayers"
It's mayors, all gauges, minimum wage the raises..


...like to Rock..


Niggas be killin' me, actin' like they ain't feelin' me
Knowin' they bustin' them guns with my artillery
Usin' my words as if it's his and hers
That's that shit that make me not wanna pass the herb
The fake artist, I'm coming Razor Sharp regardless
I bump lah, sowed of liquor, light and spark
Make it crunk live, the dirty dirty try and serve me
Like black folks in scary movies: you die early
Tony Toca, Meth Tical, vida loca
Esta loca, if she think I eat the chocha
Ma, toss the, smoke ya, win free (Winfrey) like Oprah
And un-hoast that roast, your meat, for the butcher
Licky lost ya, don't even come a step closer
When I approach a track, I slam like my culture


Chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that


GZA told you it's a "Cold World", where ya heat at?..


...like to Rock..


Hots on the shit, just so we can lock horns
Throw a package in the streets, get the block warm
Something happens when we meet, hit the block strong
Get it poppin' in your face, taste the popcorn
Now that we back on track, can't lose
My back gets huge, bitches Moulin Rouge
The way I move, the Cadillac, so smooth
Battle rap improve shit, light the fuse
Bruised off the booze liquor, doozy kicker
The dynamite style, shinin' lights still flicker
Wu-Tang stickers is a nuclear reaction
Tony Touch scratch the table, RZA on the back end
Pure, the talent, yes, yours truly
The brand combination of jazz, class and beauty
Here to do my duty, up another notch
The gospel according to rap is mega watts
Agenda never stop, dead center, mega hot
Go mop it up, go cop it when it drops..


Woman, you sure like to Rock..


Haha, come on over here..




All that heroin out there, nigga
I can't tell, nigga, what's up
I can't tell you nothing no more


Pull up the Range sport, blow in the back of the trunk
Color sickening, bitches is blunt
Snitches get plucked and popped, cut and chopped, and yo
We generate hoods and hide this gwop
For all the blocks we invading, we be caking & strip naked
I know you wasn't selling by the building, I feel the hating
Dust blunts with heroin, servin up Steak'ems
Shot him by the building, yo, and spit on his laces
Rich niggas'll rise, more eyes, yo, Busta, what up?
Chilling like we at the 25's out
Night time is vibe, pies get thrown to guys
You fuck up this money, bones is fried
I'ma stay fly, getting paper, sit on a ten acre kitchen
Bout the size of the Ritz at Penn Station, yup
Rich niggas we spot you, stay genuine, cousin
Do your numbers, fam, regardless, yo, we got you


Hahahaha... ahhhh, do it nigga, there, you should fucking..
Fucked up New York Yankee hats on fronting
Niggas know Cuban Linx when they hear it nigga
Huh... I'm the motherfucking Ali of the game, bitch


Nigga Chef back, wood back, he in the good Ac'
What's hood, me in your hood, we got the good crack
Don't violate me, I hate, I'm like Star and Buc
In the morning, I'm mourning, wild on the fake, yo
Stay dropping bracelets, cases of Cryst' and Cru'
Don't even move duke, take off your shoes
We hardbody action packed, keep a baboon
The jewels is back, with strappers on, come take it
Shoebox with nothing but hash, alotta old ass
Wallies is off the meat rack, splash
Nigga, Diamond down, moving like China Town
Me and forty-five mad real niggas, we light clowns up now




I am the wrong nigga to cross and the first nigga to jam
With the AK-cuatro siete over microphone in hand
Goddamn, Generation uno, Dungeon Fam
The lab is filled with potions of emotions out the ass
I laugh when you think that you have seen the last
But it's only the beginning, my nigga, don't be so fast
Pass gas, slow it down to a screeching halt
Impeach the President 'cause he don't think before he talk
Iraq, goddamn, now he gunning for Iran
North Korea got that shit that make LA look like Japan
Our land, nah man, more like the Caribbean
Billy Ocean bodies floating, take a voyage to Atlantis


Selling glass and blasting, machinery sling past
Next stop: Bowling Green, bling flashing
Glow my ass off, po-po, they try to harass
My dough, ching cash, and I sit in my dash and vent
You know the W that come from Dirty Bast
Bird baths, love to stunt, we got birds with gats
Fly past, buy NASA, caught up with the cash
Why blast when you know we in your crib? Bypass
I mastered what? The treasurer of getting ass
Whip assing, red pipe and leather; slick nasty
Sassy, but at the same time raspy
Plug me a thug, your mother eating plaster


Styles will change, they say change is dang-erous
As a King standing on the terrace
While his partner pointing up at the riflemen
Coward shooter, never know when your life will end
Then live like there ain't no 'morrow
And if one come, then this the motto
Now I put message in bottle
You go to the nearest beach and open your car door
And walk to the place where the sea meets the land
Yeah, it's easier to run the street than walk in the sand
Hey, I'm talking, young man, as if chalk in my hand
I will take y'all little ass to school
It's cool when the kids call me Sunny, the hood calls me Stacks
The B's call me honey, Hollywood calls me back
Crack and I have a lot in common
We both come up in the 80's and we keep that bass pumping
That's a nega-tive comparison, embarrassing
Unfortunate that if you come up fortunate the streets consider you lame
Ha, I thought the name of the game was to have a better life
I guess it ain't, what a shame
I don't slang, never slung, but I'm one with the slum
That has a name well fitting, plenty cheese getting
No wonder why they call it the trap, so watch your tail
And I'm not kidding, the rats and mice will give advice
They say, "You can paint and draw, get out of here
Go show them that we're more than slanging raw"
That's when I broke into my Big Rube impression
And I tried to enlighten but that night I learned a lesson
That the morals that you think you got, go out the window
When all the other kids are fresh and they got new Nintendo Wiis
And your child is down on her knees praying hard up to God
For a Whopper with cheese
Do you B), hit the street hard with a flair?
Or do you A), go to school for heating and air?
Dare make an honest living or make a crooked killing
Or do a bit of both until you're holding on a million?
Brilliant, you got one foot in, one foot out
You put your left foot back in and then you shake it all about
You do the hokey pokey 'til you turn your life around
That's what it's all about, 3000 out

Visual, visual, JB
Yo, Ye, what up? Raekwon


You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened I was floating, you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dining in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, patent leather
Playing the field, trying to outslick Baretta


You see, my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going? That's what nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love


I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool, tryna be cool, what you expect me to do?
I'm just tryna find, find, find this sweet love of mine


I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love


Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said "Yo what's your occupation, crazy rhyming?"
Listen to Wu-Tang, trying suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon
Stunting in a high top Louis', shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
Next show they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rocking like this 16 years old
The hard drums and the Wally's something that caught me
I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rocking the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top, old school bumping to Cash Rules
No question we the reason why the summer's blazing
Then say, "You looking good fly coloured Asian"
Raw I give it to you, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia
Until she caught me getting numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love, sweet love of mine




Why can't I find you, love of mine?
When you're standing in front of my face
Oh why, I must be blind
How did I let you get away?


Leave it up to the most high, sitting in a ghost fly
Chilling with two of my brothers
We both live on deck grabbing 'em on set
This is how we roll in the business, she a go I'mma go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month baby girl, just call me up
Waking up resting in cold sweats
Thinking of this bitch, the videotapes, even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost, I know I'm going crazy, I can't floss
Me, my lady left my homies it's all baloney
Just like rocking the old Pony's
So when I'm chilling, I'm just lost no more feeling
I need my honey in my life get that feel me
Take your time, readjust and ya you shine
My runaway love didn't mind, come on






Son! Come on, man
Leave them Phillies, man, we out, man, let's go, man...


I skated through the back of the building, hit the steps up
Ran up in Kay crib, lay daddy rest
I had to break free, police on me and they FB's
Yelling "I think his name Lex, that's his aunt, freeze"
That's when I hit the window, indo' coming out the back room
Boom, Pretty and his man, Black Caesar
Damn, they saw me and they bustin' at me
Cab just missed me, plus them goochie frames, foul, that's six fifty
Stop back at suite, them leaf defense slid through my man garden
Yelled out 'pardon', kept it moving, peace
Build be gone, ain't no honor amongst thieves
Please, plus they heard I'm getting parmagane cheese
And I won't stop moving til the metal dig me
Say word, yo, make 'em work for it, young rookie, y'all need me
That's when it is, what it is, if it's that or the cup
But in the ill gangstas book what they niggas do is
(Run) That's what it is, what it is, yo
(Run) That's when they try to get biz to niggas
Gold objects, flying through the projects
Young thugs is ducking, send babies to Spofford




Pss.. yo, yo, yo (yo son roll!)
Oh shit, yo, yo, run!


Aiyo, I jumped from the 8th floor step, hit the ground
The pound fell, cops is coming
Runnin' through the pissy stairwells, I ain't hear nothin'
Buggin', only thing I remember was the bullshit summon
So I stopped at the 2nd floor, ran across, cracks is fallin'
My pockets is lean, clean when I vanished off
Took off, made track look easy
The walkie talkies them D-E-T's had, black, they was rated P.G
Run, I will not give up, no, quick flag the car down
Take me to.. Ghost here they come now!
Errr! Pull off quick, back up, hit the bitch, dog
Turned down Hill, light the Marley spliff
Run! I will not get bagged on the rock
Run! I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops
Run! They am' shit, plan shit, destroy evidence
Fuck a case, I'm not comin' home when I'm fifty six
Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks
Before I let these crackers throw me and shit
Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop
Curse, swerve to get served, these cocksuckers got nerve
Heard I was killin' shit, they must got word
That I told the chief on Rich Port I don't wanna merge


I skated through the back of the building, hit the steps up
Ran up in Kay crib, lay daddy rest
I had to break free, police on me and they FB's
Yelling "I think his name Lex, that's his aunt, freeze"
That's when I hit the window, indo' coming out the back room
Boom, Pretty and his man, Black Caesar
Damn, they saw me and they bustin' at me
Cab just missed me, plus them goochie frames, foul, that's six fifty
Stop back at suite, them leaf defense slid through my man garden
Yelled out 'pardon', kept it moving, peace
Build be gone, ain't no honor amongst thieves
Please, plus they heard I'm getting parmagane cheese
And I won't stop moving til the metal dig me
Say word, yo, make 'em work for it, young rookie, ya'll need me
That's when it is, what it is, if it's that or the cup
But in the ill gangstas book what they niggas do is


Run! If you sell drugs in the school zone
Run! If you gettin' chased with no shoes on
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got, guns!
They givin' out life like by the tons
Run! If you ain't do shit, you it
That next felony, nigga, it's like three zip
So, run! Hop fences, jump over benches!
When you see me comin' get the fuck out the entrance!
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got guns!


Ah-hah! I might gotta take my shirt off (yeah, kid...)
I like that one (uh-huh, go in, go in!)


Yo, uh, it's Task Force Tuesday, the NARCS is in the black car
I got five hundred, hundred packs in my backyard
Clear twelve-twelve's, that look like stuff shells
I'm cuttin' niggas throats on the sails, while they puff L's
Don't leave nothin' unbagged, shave everything
I learned from the O.G.'s to save everything (to save everything)
They come by one more time, they gon' hop out
They two deep, and one is a bitch, she gettin' knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dippin' with that
Uh, down-shiftin' on 'em like I got gears on me
(Run!) Besides that, I got about 5 years on me
(Run!) Scared to death, runnin' like I got bears on me
(Run!) My Timb's start feelin' like they Nike Air's on me
(Run!) It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the Throughway
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm try'nna hold my hammer up, and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets, then jail where I die at
And I'm ashmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast
'Magine if I would of let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do


Free hold east coast whole, boxing the Philly down
Down to Dela', when ya'll rarely toting the milli round
I bring the milli to ya house, I was just down south
Carolina had the milli down there
Pearl Beach had the heater in reach, and four freaks
In Hooters, I made 'em lose it when they heard freedom of speech
Told them freaks that I gotta run, I'm on the run
But they tried to make me stay, they showed me two hooters a piece
I stayed for a second but you know I gotta skate
It's like a race, cops chase me, I'm chasing the moon
Before I left the premise, saw two more bitches
They told me they was witches, told me hop on they broom
I did, and then we went zoom
Don't you know them witches got me outtie wit the quickness
I'm buggin', I'm trippin' in reality I'm skitzin'
The cops got me trapped in the Audi wit the Smith &




D-Boy, yeah, Birdman Jr. in ya building, people
I'mma let you know how it go on my side of the mountain, whoadie


It's jump out Thursday ya heard me
And I dropped in effect since 9/11
I'm on the avenue with nines, elevens, I'm a two times felon
That's why I keep the top up, on my 9-11
Pele, in New Orleans, ain't got no Rico law
So I keep that heat in the car, but they don't know
I had that 'dro in the seat of the car
But it's hot right now, so you can see me tomorrow
Ay, Ghostface, the youngins on the block duckin' blue & red lights
While your boy bypassing fare light
But if them cock suckers ever get me dead right
Three hots and the cops swallow weed and a knife, right?
I speed at night, take it easy in the day
Go hard wit the dough, take it easy wit the yae
Yup, Lil' Weezy, I get my loot up
But at the pull up, come, I say my crew run run, boy






Yo, yo, yo, what up kid? Yo, these niggas is back, son
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) I'm telling you, spit that, done it nigga
Yeah... yeah... yeah, yeah, I seen it like a Zenith, man
You hear me man? Word up, man, ya'll know what it is
It's on again, man, for real, Top Gun, what what


Aiyo, we came through thumping like elephants
The new Range is super-charged, I remains intelligent
Back to the formula, lord, hard grammar
This is God school, make sure the lobby ain't jammed up
Excalibur swords, T-Rexes, bibles of rhymes
We in the lunchroom, weed and veggies for breakfast
Polo campus, sicker lances, the crisp
Hundred dollar kick niggas, that be showing you hand steps
Back to the dormatory, where niggas
Broke my forearm and index finger, now you write glory
True holding my flag, it's all engraved in my blade
So when I wave it, you gon' say Rae mad
Now it's 28 Days Later, now Wu's up, do something, you can't
It's blood in my eye, I might get amped
To rip something down, the billboard holders is back
So when you see me, you gon' say he gets down


From darkness to DNA, I move with my brother
And we resonate, energy that shifts in colors
Bringing MC's punishment, then I'm done with it
The meter leave way on the fast break, I run with it
It was not a hobby, but a childhood passion
That had started in the lobby and was quicky fashioned
Every line to line, bar for bar is clockwork
Hazardous and powerful enough to have your block hurt
Check the total amount of MC's inflicted
With torture, from moving with work that's restricted
We criticize producers til they joints are right
Then acupuncture the track with pinpoints of light
Hitting them from well conceiled firing positions
With explosiveness that'll make the deaf listen
Drastic, pyroclastic, connected with the same old
Down the dangerous slopes of an active volcano


Blitz like the Green Bay Packers, sack like the linebackers
Hang with niggas, like redneck crackers
Strangle cold bottles of Beck's, like a vexed German
Duck low behind the car, my tech burning
Neck burning, from eight karats of sunlight
Absorbed, in the grill, Big Pun like
Lord of the Wu-Tang sword, know what that means?
Like J.R. Tolkien, it's the Lord of the Rings
This is my man, Chef, auto, like Grand Theft Auto
The 18th letter, followed by the mark of Zorro
Plus A, not for apple, but I pack an apple
Shorty try to buck back, and knock me off the saddle
Caramel, pecan, sundae, Pregline
Plump breasts, was filled with saline
Her big booty cousin, nasty Nadine
Get you on the floor, whore tried to double team


Is he still that nucca? Is he in the hood like that?
Is he really strapped? Will he really split yo' shit?
I thought you said he rap? Pull up in the yard, ten sets
He ain't flexing, microphone ripping, heat holding
Who testing? Rope-a-dope his black lotus
Can't quote this, chat with the sword tongue
Duck when the axe is swinging, wild Apache drum
Crazy Horse kicking his thoughts, he won't quit
Can't tell 'em nothing, he grown, give the man room
Space was demanded, beat banging through the speaker
Voice, heat seek missle, guided at the listener
Swing to the gospel, catch up and wet at the brothel
Unstoppable, direction of my flow, optional
To the ear, depending on the current of air, the crowd's in




I was blacked out with shades at the wake of my man
He's so grand, Had plans to go legit but couldn't quit
Misfit mentalities lead to death young, Hold your tongue
Don't get strung and fall victim to the street life
For real it's real, Still we blast steel
Write your will cause we will, Kill at will when it's real
Cream Team is the sun's equation, In this nation of free-basin
Crimes we be lacin, Keys get cut like Jason
Lifes we erasin, He got a lead donation at Jay Street train station
In the theater, I saw the drama go on
They actin like it can't happen, I yapped em did you clap em
That's confidential information, I move like Perry Mason
Inside Pappy Mason, Raekwon gave me education
He said it's one nation, Power in his bitch station
Queens was mine like, Fiends was mine
And we ain't pussy, Murder seeds we hot
Never divid, Even if our dreams collide, Yall on the other side


Thermometers hot, Shit boilin
The cast of Troy, Gun on my lap boy, Black boys shoot moist
Python linger from the Nike armor
The Prince Charmer, Select big armor now it's horror
Multi, Say it again, We regulate and take your pies
Rae had a mask on and blue eyes
Dirty work technique, Smoother the crime out like jerk meat
Merkin in the burnt three, He hurt me
Wild iris, Slide twist to Cyrus, Benz boat pirates
The ocean blue Nikes on, The livest
Blast sharks, Cliques like Noah's ark with darts
Me, Brush and cut it out in seventeen parts
The blood version, Three hundred rock watch surgeon
Broke, My man hold me, We all hold totes, Bring it on huh
The telethon, Seance, Smooth like suede on a baby arm
All grey on, The hygienic, Grinch list on my wish list
Gettin dusted up, Quick to stick ninety-seven up
There go Meryl Lynch mits, Brownsville bitch
Light the switch, Watch to ice ship, Shallah priceless
Big fish eat little fish faggot, Go head and try to rag it
Me, I just throw it down bag it, We blow holy
Roll a Dutch, Shout out to Power Cypher yeah




A traitor is not your brother
He hadn't learned that yet
And unfortunately, brothers and sisters
Some of these kinds of people, we will have to execute
There are people among us that we will absolutely chop their heads completely from their bodies for their betrayal of black people


This is real vomit, a monumental nigga, iconic
East coast fly shit, pay homage
As promised I display all the finest few reminders
I'm feared, don't confuse my kindness, speak ebonics
Used to get bricks on consignment before rap was all that
Black power refinement this economics
Acknowledge through the eyes of my peers exotic wears
Watch glare like a mouth of veneers, my  fear
Dapper since the day of my birth
My first verse was like water for a nigga that thirst, we got it worse
Trapped on these streets in the same zone
Niggas getting bodied 'cause the beefing just came home
Shots at policemen every week and it change tones
Chicks on the shit, it's the mix, I remain strong
The drama, honor what defines my persona
I'm from a genre of drug money,  and ganja


When we come to that position in time, that we have to execute you, and we will carry out the sentence of death on you just like drinking water and hang your head on a pole in the black community


What up gangsta? Keep it popular, it's like opera
Chillin' in the one lanes, gazelle with my lockman on
Drug money bishop, used to cuddle blow in the swishes
Auto man, cocked out of suspicion
Always in the best of the best features, all I need is cameras
Surrounding us quick, go up the nina's
Murdered up flashing, 213, me and my team
Alexander McQueen, "Chef, you turned on me"
Blowing more cream, wiping the enzo off in Queens
My ghost is botanical, check the genes
All the pea coats, peacock Kangols, yo the wave game nemo
Foul styling young Al Pacinos
Huh the money get bigger nigga, don't make a nigga pull out
Sign you all, box you up little nigga
Meet me at the veteran's lounge
I got lamb on this wild, I'm meeting my luck, my paper growling


You won't sell us out, you'll be buying your funeral
The future of our people is not to be compromised
It would be better that you were dropped in the bottom of the sea with a millstone around your neck than to betray the legitimate aspirations of our people


Yeah, high-profile life, my verse is a gift from the Most High
You should thank God for my rhymes
I don't condone bullshit bars
The fuck is you talking about? You just wanna be around stars
Knock a nigga out, make a nigga see stars
I knock off your head, you still wanna act hard
My gun smoke like ganja
Get you higher than life, yee, that bull give you wings
Bet ey'thang on P, he's the showboat
Blast away a thing in the way of the lords
Lord to your death, don't cross me
I'll let you live if you don't press charges on me
And know rats must die
Keep them far away from punk shit, we can't buy
Don't ever attach me with them
I own my catalog, nigga, you getting pimped


See these position hungry ports
All you need is a promise that you gon' be a big nigga
And you'll sell out your people on a promise that the enemy will never fulfill
Keep on your feet
This is a day of separation




What makes a man a man, when his life is at stake
And it's real, cuz it's gotta get it's plates
What kind of life we live, one of those lives
We take cover and, cover your kids
How far your gun can reach, it can reach as far
As you want it, that's when a round'll release
The power is the move in the streets
Yeah, take my bread, yo take this lead, yeah, a nigga got it


Yo, how the semi automat' 'em, leave 'em flat up on the poster
I'm trying to push everything, from jets to the blow stuff
Yo, get it right, pa, I slang cosa nostra
I move around these 52 states, we just post up
I got niggas'll that ride, and if the cops pull up
Just splash the drain and run, we just blow stuff
I'm not playing, pa, no, it's not a game
I'mma bang, them 10 sharp pointy things through your coconut
We dodge prison, got lawyers for that
Holdings knots up through riddle shit, you know it's a rap
Need I remind you, so many killas on my line, too
We can form an army, get money and rhymes
That's the breaks when it come to just getting papes
No remorse, violate, we just take up the source
I'm the Montana, with long hammers, the strong arm of the city
It's just promotion on cameras




Yo, we been the life of killas, ever since we was born
First got on, we blast on gorillas
Been taught from babies to bust three eighties, the skies just blaze
Then come back, with your head in a jar
My peoples is the most important part, yeah, take us apart
Annihilate, fiends scrapping, we hating these czars
Lions in the mountains, wolves in the hood
With four pounders, how dare you lounge in the park
It's ill how we setting standards, to let them cannoms slam you
It's all strictly, pardon your art
Yeah, the general's path to blow, I'm up laughing
You fucked up, send 'em back, this the city of God
It's all about holding houses, make men out of mouses
Then drape little niggas with thousands
We strive to build, the lives is real
Eyes to kill, it's all about getting acres and marksmen






More Than Just a DJ, hip hop ain't dead
Some of you niggas ears is just fucked up
AZ, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah


I will take my time in the bushes, right
Pay the people no mind like I'm crooked, right
Shoot a nigga on down, do him something right
He on the floor, tell his grams, yo, I see the light


You know the rhetoric, top tier predicate
Stare, so whatever, shit, nigga, I'm a delicate
Do it for the hell of it, Brooklyn is the heritage
Home of the thoroughest, fully autos never miss
Call me the mellowest, murdering, verbalist
Ride through the turbulence, with la on the purple scent
G posture, bum rocker, gun cocker
Without the skully, I'm gully, sonny, a young Hoffa
Come papa, a kid left stunting
Homicide is nothing, I'm E.F. Hutton
Graze, gutter the grunting, days slayed are slumping
Twin K's, either way, compadres is dumping
Cuffed up, or something, the buck of C's and bumping
This Drama King thing, while you ding-a-lings is munching
Rae, Ghost & A, Street Sweepers'll slay
BK, Staten Island, Manhattan, but hey




Straight out the bushes, yo, from Lefrac to Bushwick
Blowing kush, catch him in buildings, sting him like cushion
High powered eagles, circulate through spots like needles
Bumping and grinding, and jetting the diesel
E-classes, feeding the masses, so much hash on my land
I had to power down and cop three tractors
Living luxurious, glorious, super deluxe hustlers
This is why we stay notorious
The emperor, call me a kings mentor, spent off the real
Money's real estate, now repent war
Crime, taxes and axes and bulletproof pens
I'm bout to get an ice glove like M. Jackson
Alpine, gooseneck systems, Calv Klein
Build blast '88 niggas who kill fast
I represent the planet of real masters
Park Hillian flashers, kill you for the will or to build action




Take me to paralyze her, drag him to Carolina
If he don't talk, stuff his mouth with the pacifier
Put his brains on his cali', make him feel the fire
Flame broil his lips, guns is lows for the appetizer
Honey roast his nuts, throat cut, leave that faggot dick like a broke dutch
Look like he woke up, bang him a cal, hanging him now
These semi autos almost took off half of his head, yo, this is Staten Island
Stay smiling, cake piling, watching our glucose
Repping forty's and brown bags, dipping from blue coats
Catch the G-Unit on a new boat, flicking it up
With new ropes, choppers banging, banging new Ghost
Applying the pressure, I bet you the K and the A will stretch ya
Leave your host, something holy like Mecca
This is real talk, blood sport, battery action
Mixed with rat poison, you punk faggots hurt, hand me your fucking package








Uh-huh, yeah, yo
Cash in a brief case, trying to play it smart
Love is a privilege and you better play your part
Don't wanna leave it to the lawyers breath
Snap my fingers, you'll be laying on the foyer steps
Wishing you were a boy again
Late night stand on the roof, smoke a newp
Reminiscing when I had the broken tooth, we were loose
Three different colors on the goose with the boots
Maryland College basketball suits
I drive the 525 made in '95
Shawn Kemps on the pedal, I'm a kamikaze
Right arm hang out the window while I steer left
Near death, slam into a deer's chest
Lights out for a second, but I'm back
Hopped up like a karate master
Still I blast the shottie faster on you bastards, make you backspin
Come out the closet you've been trapped in, that's it
Queens


Yeah, nigga you know I put the work in
Head shots real precise like a surgeon
I see your heart beating through your shirt, nervous
Nigga shaking in his J's, his legs gave in
Wow, and I ain't even pull the gun off my waist yet
This nigga done got so scared he took a shit
Then I swerved in some low key wheels
And go about my business like it never happened, chill
For reals, pop a couple pills
Cup a drink, come to think about it I feels
Like turning up the rap, ignorant, loud
Like this weed that I smoke, make a thick, yellow cloud
Perpetual payday, my money don't vacay
I'm out seeing the world, my life is so crazy
You could only imagine
But you could never fathom my intelligence, I get at em


Oh shit, it's real like that, right y'all?
Word up man, pledge allegiance man


I Patrick Ewing niggas, long shotties I be 'suing niggas
You gon' pay, face the camera ruin niggas
And my money, I'm collecting and I'm stepping
Might slap the shit out your man and take his weapon
Hungry and angry and I'm savagery, but still
More your majesty, wipe out the cool t-shirt, vacuum it
And I'm gon' keep you rich, so chill
Or you can live with them faggots and stay away from real deal abbots
Death is our game plan, new playing bullets
Come in spray cans, write graffiti all on your vest
Lester, cousin Eve sleeve all greasy
He the best of it, put it right there, you get a check
Slang prostitution, it's prohibition
When we move shit, this is what some niggas suggest
I suggest war, and clout the fake niggas
They could move out, take no chance, you never know, ya'll


For real man, cause we ain't playing no games no more, no more homies
You sit around this, you sit around the best
With gold forks and all that, word up
Y'all niggas that come shine, come through come through come shine, come
You know what it is man, it's automatic




I despise your killing and raping
You're despicable (Are you my judge?)
It's just you should be punished
I'm gonna chop off your arm, so are you ready?


Check these high hats sling tings moving through the rubbish
Party robust, rec room style for you brothers
Time's ticking, erupt misconduct
Entering one funk before the drum dry up
Dial, style, jab vocab slow
Alphabet run, construction voice might blow
Tap dance swelling Hemingway novel model
For a breather, dirty reefer hide your bottle
Cut down, come with something that's round and profound
Blood brothers, people of colors, we get down
Watch this fly, force feed things being said
Nine Diagram acid black evil red leathers
Mic half a dangle, serious a man
My mic clapper death wish, everlasting plan
Heavenly God body, know me as the cleaner
Night champion, old villain style seamer
Kiss a spider, Seagal saga why bother
Godfather talk drama, fly swatters


Number two, Chao San Poi


This Wu shit be hard to kill and full blown
Rhymes filtered through the net before words hit the chrome
Pro tools editing tracks that's rough
Cause a jam without a live MC isn't enough
So we attack this and grab all within reach
Throw a scrap back to niggas,perfect your own speech
Shit is copper, it ain't worth the mic stands
Used by backup singers in Atlantic City bands
Niggas look on and get hooked on this mic line
Reeled in and shipped through the pipeline
LPs delivered with style and potential
Niggas flowing smoothly in a sequential
Order, revealing hidden tape recorders
Stashed inside pockets of those who lack aura


Twist the DAC up, them niggas with math is back up
Watch he act up, fifty-two block track we slap up
Playground manoeuvre, jet to Vancouver like this
Two Kahluas one chick, she's German Luger
Get the shit on, light a fresh pack, bust it open
With the seal on Dunn, deal on this, with the real on
Necks rocky ring, call it the Decatur
Slang soufleer home decorater, player
Mic immigrants, nine of us formed resemblance
Somethin flashy, God dead-armed is nasty
Peep the ornaments enough to make Shorty-Wop stare at me yo
He killed the God might as well throw a chair at me


Yo MC's wonder what's Hip Hop thunder
Tell you the truth it's just one nation under a groove
Gettin down for the funk of it
Like Fred Sanford in the biz...
Yo inhale this paraphernalia, a Wu memorabilia
Melba the fortune teller, tried to tell ya
Bout the group recruit we scoop up CREAM like Breyer's
Then spread across the globe like telephone wires
Thirty-six assorted, Shaolin imported
Chambers been recorded, you're fuckin with the loops
Time for royalty audit
Fabulous establishment metabolism, Blackfoot Indian
Cherokee started out smaller than amphibian
Then grew to a physical body with five meridians
As the pendulum swings closer to the millenium
Two thousand, wickedness is spread amongst my citizen
I got a muscle the industrial to make a hustle
And politic with Lyor and Russell
When niggas is still rushin we'll brush you


He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives


Thoughts are contained in the trenches of the brain
Ignite, blowing the mic to Arabian heights
As I recite this medley, niggas couldn't fuck with the
Deadly ground I hold down
Classical gangland style, shots hit the ceiling
Panic and confusion echoes through the building
Continuing to build, I strive for perfection
Driven by the will to live, Glocks I hold
Shots I give, while searchers of rescue teams
Look for means of survival and who's liable
For this harrowing experience
You scream for the extreme, fiend for the cap
And proceeds of the Wu-Tang Academy
To fuck up your anatomy with assault and battery


Number two, Chao San Poi
Number two, Chao San Poi
He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives
Number one, Yen Chang Wa
He's an adulterer, don't trust him

Number two, Chao San Poi
He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives
I despise your killing, and raping
You're... despicable
Are you, my judge?
It's just... you should be punished
I'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?

I had my eyes squinched up tryin' to get through the fog
Pullin' up mad slow blunted, passin' police cars
I saw one two three bodies
Blood mixed with the rain ran through the gutter
That's the work of a tommy
But then I heard it was the work of a mami
Spanish chick bad, about five six, long hair, red Jag
Kinda bowlegged, Chanel sweatpants, she thick
She love her some pussy, don't really give a fuck about dick
That's when I got the call, yo Tone come to the shop
Some fire jumped, chill I'm about to pull in the lot
Lowered the tunes, pulled the Benz keys out the ignition
Brushed the ashes off my blazer then finished my Guinness
So then I walked in, seen the God shufflin' cards
Spades game, it's goin' down, he lost a couple of yards
Peace Lord, how your physical?


He upstate miserable
Stressed, doin' a thousand sets
But yo check the visuals
I'm at this hotel in Queens
Me and Charene getting' slow necked
That's live, I couldn't finish the bean
Gotta a phone call, seen the whole bitch face fall
Dope fiend look like the bitch swallowed an eight ball
They talkin' about killin' ya man's and them
That kid from Staten, his jewels is tough, his robes is satin
Yo that's my heart Tone; yea yea he killed the captain
What nationality nigga? The kid was Latin
It happened uptown, broad day, right in Manhattan
I was shoppin' with my home girl, Leona with acne?
But you know what, Flaco meets Lolita
Flew in, she from Medellin, he deaded her uncle over them seventeen bricks
Niggas ain't slick, niggas is dicks
Y'all got beef for life now cause that bitch is a trick


Ay yo fuck that, close the gate


And lower the shade
Then a shot popped off


Hit lil' bro in his fade
And then I see him dropped his clippers


He dipped with the quickness
It was Lolita black down yo


With four other bitches
He had a nasty hammer, fat ass


Her tits was bananas
Yo the clip was ninety shot


She lit up the cameras
So then I bugged out, ran up the steps


Yo I got hit in the leg


He shot back, hit one bitch in her breast
Under the pinball game aimin'


It's foggy and rainin'


My jewels is clangin'


Yo Tone tuck your chain in
She shootin' like she wanted a payment
Throwin' bullets like Joe Nameth, yellin'


Yo it's all entertainment
Where y'all girls at? Where ya'll pussies at?
Thought y'all bang on Gaten Island?
I killed three things on Staten Island

(Guns firing)
Take that!
You fuckin' with me huh?!
That's all you got babyyyyyy?
Hold that! Motherfuckaaaaa!
Yea! You on Staten Island now nigga!


Now where the fuck is your brain at now ho?
You fuckin' with me, brains is all over the wall like Velcro
I fuck your pussy while you die slow
Wake up! You cock suckin' ass maricon

That's what you get for killin' Frankie

(Police loudspeaker)
Tony Starks, Tony Starks drop you weapons now
Put your weapons down or we will shoot

Ay yo Rae I got this
I ain't surrenderin', they gon hang me
You know what it do, yo I love you
Say peace to my kids, say peace to my wiz
I ain't goin' to jail
Fuck it's on G, let's get...FUCK Y'ALL NIGGAS!






Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck I'll fuck your ass up!


(Yo, hut one, hut two, hut three, hut!)
Ol' Dirty Bastard, live and uncut
Styles unbreakable, shatterproof
To the young youth, you wanna get gun? Shoot!
Blaow! How you like me now?
Don't fuck the style, ruthless wild
Do you wanna get your teeth knocked the fuck out?
Wanna get on it like that? Well, then shout!


Yo RZA, yo razor, hit me with the major
The damage, my Clan understand it be flavor
Gunnin', hummin', comin' at ya
First I'm gonna get ya, once I got ya, I gat ya
You could never capture the Method Man's stature
For rhyme and for rapture
Got niggas resignin', now master
My style? Never!
I put the fuckin' buck in the wild kid, I'm terror
Razor sharp, I sever
The head from the shoulders, I'm better than my competta
You mean competitor, whatever, let's get together


Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the tri-BLOW!


I react so thick, I'm phat, and yo
Rae came blowin' and blew off your headphones, black
Rap from, yo, Cali to Texas
Smoother than a Lexus, now's my turn to wreck this
Brothers approach and half step
But ain't heard half of it yet
And I bet you're not a fuckin' vet
So, when you see me on the real
Formin' like Voltron, remember I got deep like a Navy Seal


Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
I'll fuck your ass up!


Yo! I come with that ol' loco style from my vocal
Couldn't peep it with a pair of bi-focals
I'm no joker, play me as a joker
Be on you like a house on fire, smoke ya
Crews be actin' like they gangs, anyway
Be like, "Warriors, come out and play-ay!"
Burn me, I get into shit, I let it out like diarrhea
Got burnt once, but that was only gonorrhea
Dirty, I keep shit stains in my drawers
So I can get fizza-funky for ya
Murder, taste the flame of the Wu-Tang
Rah! Here comes the Tiger vs. Crane
I'll be like wild with my style
Punk, you play me, chump, you get jumped
Wu is comin' through at a theater near you
And get funk like a shoe, what!




It's hard to be a success if you never was
And I never was
The greatest thing I ever did was put on some leather gloves
And selling drugs for this ghetto love
But instead of love, I got the dead above looking down on this petty thug
Never budge is what I tell a judge, slouchin' in my seat I think I said enough
Fuck 'em
Look in my face, my eyes red as blood, it's nothin'
Mr. Nickels ain't known for lettin' up, so cuff 'em
You think this champagne I'm spillin' is the reason I'm a villain
Believe that I'm appealing because the green is to the ceilin'
I'm fiendin' for a million
My champagne wishes and caviar dreams fulfillin'
I'm finna make a killin'
But still I'm by that building where these niggas try to kill 'em
Cause when he's not around is when his niggas never feel him
I know they sick of hearing Ran's name, he always talking about his damn pain
Shampain


Take a little sip, all you really need is a bottle of the
(Champagne)
I don't know if you be drunk, or be high, if you low, all you really need is some
(Champagne)
Champagne, champagne, champagne
(Champagne)
All you really need is some, all you really need is some
(Champagne)


Yea, all they heard was exhaust pipes
Being broke at 40 give a nigga the frostbites
Everybody just can't be living the boss life
If it's good, then cop the whole thing if it cost right
Breeze through, shoot past, shorties'll shoot fast
Bubbly, but it don't come in the flute glass
You smell it and it's already lit
Plus you controllin' the crowd so they know you legit
Name speak for itself so they know who you with
By the time you see the sparkles, you already hit
Real shit
Similar but it's different, drippin' instead of sippin'
For every bottle you pop there's a nigga slippin' the clip in
Still plottin', itchin', pill poppin', and sniffin'
Sucka nigga is just watchin' and wishin'
Sad part about it, it's a damn shame
Cause all he needs is a little bit of champagne




We like the trench coat mafia, flesh from Czechoslovakia
All the guns with alcohol and sake, huh
Criminals pass, who's show improves?, we up to date
No flakin' no moves, the niggas'll lake you in two
Pass by the Caesars in Vegas
My shooters is waiters
With magnums on strap, splittin' potatoes
Was a rough road I rose
Now we in roses froze
What it do cat daddy? I told you out the (?)
To live in luxury past the treys
Gold joints, we kings from violent plays
Cigars we wizards who only wear (?)
(?) straps on Champion hoods, this ours
A town where they live comfortable
We come through, frontin' through
We always in somethin' if somethin' new
Drinkin' at the stadium, philosophical theories
Thinkin' 'bout fixing the World Series
Here me?


If the money and the fame don't take away the pain, it's a God damn shame
(Shampain)
We been workin' for these whips, tryin' to get a nice chain, now that's what I call slave
(Shampain)
It don't matter if you down or up, we pourin' bottles out in them hallways
(Shampain)
Livin' in this hell long enough will make you want to take away the Shampain






Master!
*sounds of fighting*
Toad style.. hmmph
The Shaolin deliberately tried to use the Lord
To learn our Wu-Tang sword fighting!
The Shaolin would never do that!
Wouldn't you? The Shaolin have always looked down at us
Are you afraid the Wu-Tang would become more famous than you?
You?
So you used your Shaolin poison to set up my master and deliberately frame me!
That's nonsense!
It's not nonsense! I saw it myself!
Nonsense! The Shaolin have nothing to fear from the Wu-Tang but our swordfight

Jakes hate it, Rae made it, Clientele, we gon' sell
You gon' starve, he gon' jail, night boots, swim with whales
Better snub, surgical leather gloves, never loved
We gon' kill, take it to the Hill, we forever real
Old records, old luggage, you ill with no rugged
You shoot and we spray, kill off them old buzzards
We love it, can't stand it, you hid, the The Wu Manual
We found it, stay grounded, we will, we still scrambling


Hold your fire!
You two traitors!
You've mixed the Shaolin and Wu-Tang
No, we have not, it's just that they're the same
That's right, my Lord
You misunderstand our kung-fu work
It doesn't belong to anybody, IT EVOLVES!
Kill 'em!

To my hard rocks, locked in cell blocks, never shell shock
Melt the ox in your face, displaced in the penalty box
My enemies heart pumps poisonous blood, your choice, the slugs
You do dirt in the rain, than your name is mud
Major love to thugs in the back of the clubs
Strapped for what? TO avoid bein stuck and blazed up
Laced up, struck from the waste up, embraced by the muts in the cut
Bullets sizzle up, leave you fist fucked, intense cut
]From Leatha and Uey, verbal gymnast
Volvo, physical fitness, over tracks leave statistics
Tripped into the realm with chrome shines like sunlight
Half of my life is right, the other half is a gun fight
Uptight jake harassin for college satisfaction
101 question askin in back of the paddy wagon


Sadly, tragedy happen
Lost in captivity, imagine me happily clappin
Big barrels, heavy ammo, man the mammal
Packed in commando, rapidly practice supreno
Crack my fingers on pianos
I torture you with orchestra tackle on your back, the jackel
No time to react, combat, flyin scrap metal
Kamikaze degrees, cherry instant fire, live wire
Dunn, rock it til your knees drop, over tree tops
Collosal current enforcin, outer bridge crossin
One foot first, is the rebirth, the crime arson
Caution, furnace flyin, deserters try to black ball us
Over the face of the Earth's surface
The heat is heatin up, demon from the east wing
Hitman's bullet, leave you barely breathin and barely seein
A critically blaze, biblical plague in amaze
Riddle the box, smmothered in cops
Sky hugger, Space Jam, slam in the blizzard of rocks
A space invader, laced with lazers and with omega weapons
Magnificent 7, this cannibal mouth, gangsta spectrum
Form an animal house, fume at 11


We shell shocked, we burn hotter than a meltin pot
Your skeleton drop, as your cells start to pop
We dwell on blocks, while you cats held my the cops
Blow fire from you tops, your expired by the shots
Hot wired by the watts, exterminate ya, terminate ya
War displayed by the real niggas


On his wrist saw the spiral, glass hand
Last man to eat tracks like you straight up, hit up a white dude
Jean jacket, Austrailian gats, Mediterainian raps
Play the back with the joint on his neck
Who feelin this? Thugs love this, we way above sea level, love
Check out the glove, stay bloodied up, plug this
Verbal hygiene, the Golden Arm, plus niggas stay warm
See ya out in Mexico, we implantin The Swarm
All niggas snatch money, watch the sweater, criticize my Fila
Sneakers cost cheddar, with the heat out
Brolic, extra large, dynamic, crack your ceramic in half
Go against The Grain, we feedin you math
What up? Niggas call it high-tech, big shank reign
Straight out the kitchenette, jums in the set
Before I go, analyze all money go
Yeah, you seen him, a 6 double O, rockin bummy clothes


Bloody Red Hook, money and crooks
Get out my face with them funny looks, ya better off studyin books
Let the weed burn, they brain dead, I feed em the worms
Y'all be actin up and showin off, in needin to learn
You know the sun shines as the Earth turns
Nowadays is the ghetto germ, knockin off whoever concerned
I dip your brain in the blood of fire, prophecize like Jeremmiah
Turn a crowd to a choir, hot wired space ships
Fed niggas who I hate with, I be Apocalyspe, Tales of the Crypt
Raise the dead out the realm with a 6
Overwhelmed by the smell of the clips, gun smoke, shots hit
We surrounded by Hell and politics, bulletproof or hollow tips
I'm the silencer on the loudest clip
The widow maker, Heaven Razah, put of curse on whoever major
Snatch the belt off the heavy weighter
I be a Swarm alligator, slap niggas way across equators
When the dare try to flaunt they paper



* Various talk in club with Poppa Wu sample in background *




Hibachi pots, Lemonade scotch in the Glock
Toast whoever ?? a nigga's watch
Riched up feeding her French duck
Up in Prime One, one son on me, he shoot like he fuck
A Welly Fargo yo Gallardo jet red
Listening to Marvin and Keith in them ??
Gambling spots, I own the lease
Quarter millions only, on top of the grass we got suites
Man, bottles of Rose, the OJs is here with cold play
I sit back, perform in the grown way
My paper is proper, my bitch hella copped
I bought, copped me to Alans ?? courts
So many reasons to eat
Don't wanna kill no more, ayo, I'm two steps away from the ??
Lee and Dirty ain't cleaned it in years
I'm hustling a new way, my bookkeeper is standing right here
Ice water is the logo, y'all niggas know so
Flavor like a adobo bring the mayor to ??
It's promo rap nigga, I grow though
Catch me south France lumberjack mink bunch of snow cones


I've been watching, I've been learning
It seems like I've been hustling for years
Now that I've got my earnings
I wanna get away from here
Cause as the world keeps turning
I'mma get mine I swear


Pull them off the lot, let's race 'em
I'm here to break the set to the break who can take 'em
The ambiance, giving no response he gets what he wants
The scratch that he flaunts, nightmares he haunts
I'm just a smooth killa, nothing to prove nigga
Your shit is hard but I'm like, ten times iller
I'm Merlot Sipper you can see my habit
I'm just a businessman besides your chick magnet
A grown woman lover, a shorty's father figure
You keep it all hood, I'm thinking much bigger
Cause life is sweet you spread your wings
The land, the kings, we get right and handle things, you hear?
Like pieces on the board
And my quest for peace is what made me a warlord, dig it?
Spit bars exquisite
No lies, I live it
No telling which island I plan to inhibit
Laid up with a bad bitch, choking on a cigar real far
Feeling stout pussy by the seashore
Smoking jacket and more broads
I'm here to get all yours
The prettiest one you pick, down on all fours




Hide the body, I got that hammers that hate you
Extended clips that's ungrateful
Only thing I could promise is your exit won't be graceful
I'm just hoping your necklace is tasteful
Put you to sleep, that's how I wake you
No alarm clock could ever wake you
I stay out late at night grinding for my payout
I shot my way in, I shoot my way out
That's if I have to, see how it play out
You have a better understanding for the day out
Politic ?? fine tools out there to lay out
AK out
Taking over blocks, making over spots
As the uncut raw and baking soda locks
Last stop inside this coke boy tour
Searching for paradise over this dope boy war






Niggas is sitting around, selling it for money
What the fuck is that? Chill chill what up?
Stop playing, man, man, you know what it is, man
Fuck that, you know what it is, yo, nigga what up?
Where that money? Man, yo, yo, yo, come here!
Stop acting like you don't know, you already know


Indian head, jewelry
Out in Egypt with the wrists of fury
Spanking bracelet, rocking Asics
Trick bandit, Ghost is brick granite
At the U.S. Open with my whole len, slapping up fifty scramblers
Niggas said the II was classic, a lot of crack is in the game, yo
But your shit is the only 'lastic
C.R.E.A.M. rap, militant flow, combination with Swahilian dough
Guaranteed we dose that, in the beast like pizzas
All I know is reefer and street stuff
Stay fly, moving in fleece, what?
Traveling the continents with confidence
Cuban Linx III coming, don't know when, but the time is running


By any means on, Ron O'Neal lean on
Freestyle, you want it from Ghost? Then throw C.R.E.A.M. on
Suited up, smelling like Fahrenheit with jeans on
Knock the rice out a wedding, come and get your bling on
Next winter we in log cabins, more baggage, more savage
Central Park killas, that equals more stabbings
You read the papers, more horrors like Amityville
Profanity kills, you like lint on a raggety silk
We rock bulls, rock jewels, you heard the interludes
Blow up beds in a fifty yard swimming pool
Jumping out of planes for dough, Gucci parachutes
Abdul Raheem written across is the Ashtabu'
Suede loafers, 'Lo scarves, my little grandson want
The 20-10 Mercedes-Benz go kart
So he can pull out the lollipop keys on 'em
His pops'll push the Bugatti drop V on 'em
Stampede on 'em, Rap Playoffs got a three-nothing lead on 'em
Sparking MC's like we quoting our degrees on 'em




Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, aiyo, aiyo


Aiyo, one of the illest, the sickest, like six sixes
Lookin' real rich, don't switch, just paint pictures
Lex, tell the story, get these niggas in line for me
Plus the shorty's, light one from me


Sit back like kings, diamond rings on, 'knowledge the genes
Matter of fact, 'knowledge the team
Kid love valor suits, raw Coups, racing across
The bridges, we hit bitches, then swindle the group
Who's your favorite rapper? Lex Diamond, and his man Iron?
So many niggas bitch, y'all dick, I ain't lyin'
Show niggas how to dress too
Well, yo, we take it from here, now let me bless you
Ssee I got my life right now, got a new team, new label
New way of moving, new glass cable
And they still jello the kid, well did
On the corner, ice rockin' Carvel kids
Spit thirty six flavors, bitch
Burn out Vegas, fuckin' mine, y'all catch all razors
Fuck around and poison one of y'all, Cristal
New shit, havd your mother on the bottle wildin'
We came here to rep, step, movin' in motion
Angel lotion on, coastin' the set
Bitches yelling, "he look rich, he got fix"
Came up, bought a drink, thought he'd be all on my dick






Ah-ye-ye, yeah!
Rrah!


Old school players to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumping like kangaroos
But skew it on the barbie, we ain't tryin to lose
Say, "I be got, damn it, they done changed the rules"
Old school players to new school fools
Kast keep it jumping like kangaroos
But skew it on the barbie, we ain't tryin to lose
Say, "I be got, damn it, they done changed the rules"


The common denominator, the nigga numerator
Never know who the hater, niggas cater to your ego
I'm sorry, like Atari, who's the cousin to Coleco
Vision, caught a RICO, back on the street like Chico
DeBarge, he large and got a 'Lac in the garage
Few parts here and there, I declare hard, my Lord
One at Clark, one at Spelman
Both know each other, and it's cool, you can tell when
He step off in the party, women jump for joy
But all the wild niggas scheming, they gon' jump the boy
For spittin' all that bourgeoise"My watch, my car"
I'm a star, I'd rather be a comet by far, rrah!

Say, "I be got, damn it, they done changed the rules"


Deliver this through your audio, ghetto mafioso
Grow hydro, then bag it up slow
Price that, longevity suggest make moves slow
Take time, grow eight, react nine, blow!
Hydro slide raw like fuck Ronaldo
Fly ride though, shit lookin wild dope
Then glide yo, flippin' the page, I go
Watch five-oh, jump on my meat, ride slow
Watch those, undercovers, cop those, rock those
Glocks blows leave em baggy and collect spot grows
Keep a watch froze, lean on the yacht and wash clothes
Let the chop' blow, bag a half a block plot grows, what?


Old school players to new school fools
Kast keep it jumping like kangaroos
But skew it on the barbie, we ain't tryin to lose
Say, "I be got, damn it, they done changed the rules"

Boi, I bust raps like D-boys bust gats, shit
We the type of people that don't bury the axe
Or the hatchet, everytime we see your link we snatch it
Ridin round our hood talkin' that dumb shit, your cabbage
Is cracked, like plumber's ass, and summer's grass
I been in the game for a minute, seen some suckas like y'all passin
Thinkin' you're light skinned, aight then, lil' boy why you frightened?
The Dungeon Family gon' be here nigga so keep writing
I gotta hit The Source, I need my other half a mic
Because that Southerplayalisticadillacmuzik was a classic, right!
College Park, East Point and Decatur they got my back, so
We gon' keep on jammin and stabbin off in the track, ahh
Think it's time to bungee but buddy we will be back
And I'm fin' to put some D's on the 'Lac, know dat!

It was a Friday night Rikers had it bad one time
Cause niggas getting bagged on a regular son
D's like "Fuck the drugs, all we want is the guns,"
So I proceed with caution, eyes open whenever walking
Niggas be ass talking then be victims of extortion
Hold myself down the only way I know
Niggas pumping back in streets, in debt cause they owe
Street life is like a trial, ass out if you blow
The maximum is death son you know how that go

I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
At second hands, moms bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, rocking the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I be getting the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son, rolling with this one and that one
Pulling out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smoking woolas at 16
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-tight clique and went all out
Catching keys from across seas
Rolling in MPV's every week we made forty G's
Yo brothers respect mine or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-POW, move from the gate now


I'm so tired, sheep are counting me
No more struggle, no more energy


It's been twenty-two long hard years of still struggling
Survival got me bugging, but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck selling drugs and such who never had much
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not touch
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacing - going upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned I learned life is hell
Living in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes giving chase, selling base
Smoking bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed and I ask what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained working hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks and
Stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be living proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's running wild, smoking sess, drinking beer
And ain't trying to hear what I'm kicking in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic


I'm so tired, sheep are counting me
No more struggle, no more energy
No more patient, you can write that down
It's all to crazy, I'm not sticking around






Sometimes I like slim, sometimes I like thick
Sometimes I combine and I like them slick
Them slick probably went over your head
Couldn't lay up, I just went over for head
Made a change of plans, when she bent over the bed
Now she on the balcony, pinned over the ledge
Been a few days but I sent over some bread
It can get rough with tuition and rent over your head
Not the same hoes to rescue anybody
But a nigga knows what stress do to the body
And no they see me on the best shoot buzzing naughty
Shit be looking fresh like shoes and Bugatti's
And I don't know why you been in high heels
But I swear we all on one
And if you do know that man, girl
I be like, where you know 'em from
You so slick, so small, curvy
Teeth all pearly, hair all curly
When it's time for it, you look all girly
Never look tired, but you wake up all early
Hit the gym, to keep it toned up
Progress, keep picking your phone up
Ah shit, waist getting smaller, niggas all on Instagram
Like damn I need to call her


That body perfect in my eyes
No matter what they say, everything lookin' just fine
You got that blessin' in disguise
You Wouldn't know it, girl you got me

Thim slick girls get me every time
Thim slick girls could get every dime


Damn, you got a fat lil' pussy
Meatloaf gangsta, real good nookie
Only love hard rocks, tough lil' cookie
Leave a nigga balls all blue like a tookie
Yeah pretty walnut skin, pistachio an guinness, got me 4 nuts in
I record what is dome busting
Stay going raw on Forbes Hustling
The ass in the kitchen, hash for the Simson
Butt naked clean up my gun and you're all vintage
You loaded it up, cocked over the sink
Cock in my hand, while I'm pouring your drink
Yo, yo watch how you hold that lady
Eighteen hundred grand hammers, I'mma throw that baby
Flying through the city in the old ack navy
While he green peril with caves in the state key
Now bouncing your butt up, milf queen vadge better built
We can make love real slow cuz it's better felt
Yeah surely murder that thing as we slept that night away
I had to swerve out of king
Off the chain work out chick that do yoga
Leg over her head, finger in her chocha
That's my type of chick
Ride or die body, ride body, yo' them are slick






Take it back 1993, '94 or something
Yeah, runnin' through the stairs and shit
Trynna to get to the roof
Narcotos is on, some other shit


My niggas won't stop til we straight, select bigger gates
We won't stop until we buyin' estate, yo
Pull out them burners and front, where I'm from
Better shoot something, if not, niggas won't salute nothing


Corner filled chains and Gucci glasses
The was the era when we flipped all the shh, on the store, splashed it
Had Dominicans runnin' and eatin' steak and cheese sandwiches
They in the back, braggin', the fifth slut
Fuckin' with a few niggas nieces, take it back when we would
Rock for a leases and stand on the speakers
I got the shit locked, I'll battle you, you, you and your whole gridlocked
Little shit, supported the beef
Fly Pierre couldn't tell me nothin' with a brand new beard
Couldn't wait, but kept survivin' the years
We sold crack daily, crack mad bailey's, crack faces and skulls
Sit back, watchin' the mack, twist carefully
It was them horrifyin' times, spit dimes
Police sneak up, I hope he know the time, get mine
Just livin' the ghettos, where we suppose stand loyal
But the game'll get you trapped when it's time, yo




The year's 1990, everybody grimey
Crack was what's in it, the vehicles was 1-90's
Young shorties be gettin' their bread, haunted by Jamaicans
Them niggas had their corners on red
Map the laws, runnin' cards, playin' bars
Mask the coke in the cars, twist the gan', mad, crackin' cigars
Smokin' through Queens, bitches stealin' Guess jeans
Get the scope on our stars, little did we know, we folow they dreams
Now we get around in live limosines, flash stacks in cuisines
Combat, get to smackin' the fiends, just max for a minute and lean
All the shit for the moment, slick omens, my opponents would scheme
We were shot downtown, hit trains, buy cables and remain
The illest villains, walkin' in spots
Playin' the corners, baby, vision or not
Said yo, and when it's on, we gon' rep and rock, nobody call the cops




Where all the major swingers, yo
Where all the live fresh, came home, up state livin' fly rangers
We rep them niggas and we love 'em
Sons, we hug 'em, they make it home and be gone in a week
That's some letters, all my niggas live together
Baby yellin' whatever, we all write in hands, nothin' but creeps
Hold me down, love, I'll hold you fatter
Watch me catch both of these actors, it's Ice Water throwin' hits in the cling
Bloodhounds is on you, goons is beamin'
Take it to the team to team, plot thing, blew you a bean
It's just a young poor hustlers thing
But your gun got a ring, if you gonna live like a young kid




Too all them killas and the bank robbers
This is another, another, Smith Bros. production
Production, it's Lex Diamonds, muthafucka
You know what time it is




Fly, fly, up against the wall stand off, Killah
We here, we here, nigga, you see us
You see us nigga, flyin' through your city
In the mean shit, word up, just analyze it nigga
Yeah, realizin' the world


My niggas won't stop til we straight, select bigger gates
We won't stop until we buyin' estate, yo
Pull out them burners and front, where I'm from
Better shoot something, if not, niggas won't salute nothing


Yo, aiyo Rae, check out the bangle (uh-huh)
Where niggas brought to an angle
Look how it shine, arm is like thank you


Yo, pa, yo I already peeped that
But did you peep the cream of wheat
Oatmeal seats that hugs you like bean bags?


Yo, he had ads in the Staten Island ad
He bought a Benz, a Bentley, his promotion was the best
In Queens, throughout, all coliseums, right
Mint condominiums, bitches, premium shittin' on millennium
He was a master when he bought Henny
And, good at plaster and he taught many
Thinkin' like fuck bitches, can't stop me now
I'm legal, like the feds can't knock me now
Shoulders is cocked d., plus he his donuts where the cops be
His bitch on the M.C. tip, is Foxy
Chop shops is where his pops be
Blow his money on hoes, plus he O.G
And he quick to paparazzi


His sweaters is the steel version, cut the commercialism
Go hard, jumpin' out of Saabs, writin' ill verses
Represent towns and vallies, all rallies and ballies
Rolled down, blowin' Cali weed
The Hennessey pourin, remixin' it with Crown
When egotistic get down, the hundred wolves in woolie coats
Niggas throats is heavy, he's used to wearin' ropes
Sailin' in boats, the goats let me live and standin' loyal like the kid 70
I'm ancient, zippers is made of gold, I prevail well
Who be rockin' them steel wells
Yo, it's us, a hundred busters, three hundred barrels of dust
Lustin' discussions, the world will remember us
Catch me poppin' sweats and Timbs, with gats, iller brims
Take ups is matchin' all gold ratchet
A hundred villains, billion assets
Smashed up my last jet, blood on my jumper, flood it with gas wet
Catch me poppin' sweats and Timbs, with gats, iller brims
Take ups is matchin' all gold ratchet
A hundred villains, billion assets
Smashed up my last jet, blood on my jumper, flood it with gas wet




Very good!
Who are you?
We are from the Wu-Tang
Shaolin's the foundation
From which all kung-fu springs
Buddha's name be praised


I met him by Snake Pond, my hand on the flamer, my bomb
I park, Rae, Ghost, then lit up the bong
It's nightfall, nothing here, nothing to fear
Just got things to touch on, then he walked up weird
Walked in frail as stale, his eyes were soft
His face was pale, I looked at him kneel
Just wanna talk, you a deer, starting chasing him
He jumped in the tree, had grass in his ear
I'mma kill you nigga, you gonna have to come down
Little did he know I was a leader, a full bred eater
Jump in new V's, shopping, had the fever
Next stop Starbucks and Spiegels, Jags had diesel
Then she walked in, fly little diva
Niggas on the scheme for your gleam, they come from your school
A bunch of snake bites, they bitch smacked Shareen
She slid in the '09 Beemer, with that sex whore Sabrina
Forging checks, live in Medina
Thanks for the info, my kinfolk, listen, Miss Window
With the big pimple on her temple
Any more knowledge is college, you gave enough to be bounced now
She shot up in Chipotle, don't quote me
917, 646, you know it's war, bitch, can't dress for nothing, she fronting
Took a piss, roll up, let's twist, pulled down my pants
Good look, and shot through her tits
Now I gotta picture who I'm looking for, fake ass Brooklyn boy
I know his fucking family, fuck 'em all
I used to love brothers, now I hate 'em
Mostly them gator boys, who stunting and they never seen nathan
Me and my real soldiers who started it, won't play part of it
But I'mma get to the bottom, I got 'em
Newspapers saying they shot 'em, but on the low
I heard he shot himself
A trip, yo, the poison me, I come from the poison bees
Where mothers run old nightclubs with tons of ki
Old lady holding them G's, dope fiends, holes in they jeans
Magicians that can make blow green
I know his whole team, no craze, dough so low
I hit 'em off mean, now he wanna hold me, no bro, B



I'm not payin 140 for them (size 8 and a half)
I'm tellin you I'm only payin 90

Yeah

CHORUS 2X




Damn, your lovin' got me tranked out, the handkerchief out
We walk the bank route; shorty be careful with your link out
Miss Fendi girl, Wimbledon chick who rock a stick shift
Photogenic, crazy athletic, mad equipped, tempted
Using your mind, that's the jewel of life; Science is right
Walking the righteous path, peace God, love you mad
So when you're zonin from the head start we blessin your heart
Peace, I'm outta here girl, check out the best part


Never have I been so mystified by anyone's love before
Hey, I feel so natural, I keep comin back for more
And each time we touch you open up a new door
Baby you're such a midnight tease
It's gonna take everything to keep you from me, hey
And the joy that your lovin' brings
Can separate the mountains from the sea


I don't wanna be wrong, but it feels right
If loving you is so wrong, I don't wanna go on
I don't wanna be wrong, but it feels right
It feels good, so good, so good, so good

Spent so many nights believing I was wrong for you bein' in my life
I can't ignore it when some say that it ain't right (It ain't right)
I decided you're the best thing that happened in my life
I haven't had everything, oh no
But you come close to everything that love means, hey yeah
In heaven's eyes love is embraced between you and I
Now that we have each other I don't have to dream






Yeah, straighten up, niggas let's go, man
For real, man, we goin' in there, man
I'm just gonna say it like this
Eeyithing we do, is for real
Dedication, man


From out the rising sun up north, I'm asking Allah
Writing poetry, click clack, my brain'll go all
Lay this new down, I copped them out in Spain
That's some new town, all W's up, come from under Wu
Suckers switch rhymes, patterns on point, flexing slick lines
Catch me in the crease of the beast, Lexus big tires
Always been a leader homeboy, niggas'll blow the beef up
Drink beef eat 'em I meant the German, she be, but try
Thousands of talents, good with nine hundred of them
Niggas don't eat, the wolves taking something then
If you call collect, you better say what's up with them
If you borrow the Tech, you better have a muzzle on them
If he out in despair, you better have a puzzle for them
If we buyin' some gear, you know to bring the duffel for 'em
No we don't just hustle, all we do is tussle for it
Get shot in ya mouth that's just for cussin' to 'em


We don't talk cause talk's cheap
The wolves preyin' on the weak, lose paper or lose sleep, nigga
My shit bangin' like a steel drum
Hey this a dedication of the real ones
From N.Y. to Long Beach
To these T-Dot streets
Lose paper or lose sleep, nigga
My shit bangin' like a steel drum
Hey this a dedication of the real ones


I'm writing to give you more of me, there's more to see
More than petty wars and monotonous beef
I'm more than meets the eye, I'm the eye of the beast
So keep eyein' me too long and get your eyelids beat
The militia, Ice Water dynasty
Your rhymes is weak, and you don't want the line to speak
Your wine'll freeze, Get drunk and climb in sheets
About a dollar, I could go through ten dimes in a week
I got sick of chasing stars with spacious cars
Like take this, tape of ours, no tape no bars
Hoping they, take it abroad in a place so hard
That I could replace my broad and replace my job
I pray that god grant me whatever I deserve
Cause I don't want to grow to be legend of the curve
But believe in it and the will come
Eh, this a dedication to the real ones






Yo, Cas' what up son? (What's going on, Playboy
I was looking over there) Yo, I got me a good one and all that
What's up with you? (Oh ok, ok, you know I got me something
Lovely too, you know how we do it) You know how we that, man
Super official, right? (All day, if it ain't official
I ain't fucking with it) That's right, son, (Hahah, yeah) real


So many nights I felt crying (can't get you off my mind)
All this time I felt like dying (love's so hard to find)
So I, had to move on, yes I, had to stay and strong
And I, got to keep it going, so long, so long


It's usually the beauty that attract me
But perhaps she was the right place
And her personality made me happy
And that's why I persued her, I'm a dude that make manuevers
If I choose her then she whipped, cuz my dick as long as a ruler
She made me kinda crazy, it's cool, as long as I school her
I'm smooth as Grand Puba, and I can charm a computer
For us to converstate, all it take to make an impression
Like a teacher lecturing, when I'm speaking she taking lessons
But everytime we argue and fight, I feel I'm dying
I feel like kinda tell you the truth, you feel like I'm lying
But I'mma move on cuz I'm strong as ever without you
I can do better, but I can never forget about you




Aiyo, I laced you with the girl brittle shoes, when was young
Doing your thing, I want that and fire, buying the businesses
Queen in the temple, with the scent of a lemon
Ordering Lennon shit, at time, I'm just deserving your living
With all that long hair, sexy little walk in your thong gear
We at the car, you all up under my arm, where --
We shopping, embracing you with locks, and Glocks and Timbs
Flying from Africa, yo, back to the block
We just a sah-dodja, that's why your ones is owes up
Just when I needed you, you'll never get frozed up
A laced out lady with taste, I got to just taste your face
Keep it underground, and peace to the breaks, one, one




Without her being crazy depressent, they say her body perfect
But her honey burst the complexion, close to perfection
Plus you got a body that can probably turn a gay man straight
You stay in shape, mami, started taking karate
So while she did her bid in the gym, running the treadmill
I'm running from feds still, keep one in the head, still
I be reminiscing, boo, whistlin', that's real, real
Is you nice in the bed, and you nice with the head skills
You awfully fine, I can't get you off my mind
I ain't frontin', yeah, I lost a dime
But you crossed the line and made me follow directions
Gone, getting back together is out of the question, I've moved on






I can't get off my high horse
And I can't, let you go
You are the one, who
You are the one, who makes me feel
So real, heh yeah
No, what am I supposed to do
No, what am I supposed to do, baby
When I am so hooked out on you
Then I realized, that you are, somebody else's guy
Oh yeah, why you wanna go and do this to me, boy


You knew from the jump, I'm not a one woman man
That's how it started, get out my life, now scram
I don't give a damn, slam the door behind you
Need I remind you, don't let false love blind you
Cuz I wine and dine you with coiffure plates
Threw logs on the fire at the Pocono Estates
On Temptation Island, we was wrecked shipmates
I knew from the gate, you was kinda shiesty
You called all my numbers in my phone, you wasn't wifey
Go 'head try me, I plead my case
While you and your friend talk all day on the Sprint
How I ain't no good, better leave his ass quick
But you keep on stalkin' in the Ultima with tent
On some psycho shit, whoa, you make no sense
Peekin' over fences, you not my wiz
I just ran on through you and handled my biz


Can you remember, the times we spent together
Sharin' our days in the sun
That's when I found out, that you were somebody else's lover
And after all the plans we made, now they shattered
But still I


I can't get off my high horse, I can't let go
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Ooh, what am I supposed to do, when I saw you
And I realized, that you're somebody else's guy


See that day in September, I'm sure you can remember
That's when all the stuff hit the fan
You told me a lie, and you didn't have an alibi
But baby, hell, I still cared, you know I


Love you so, baby, that I can't let you go, no, no
You are the one that makes me feel so real
Ooh, what am I supposed to do, when I saw you
And I realized, that you're somebody else's guy


Read the letters sweetie, your style is fuckin' me up
Completely I ran, dropped you at the grand with the TV
Lacin' you with jewelry was nothin', brought a flower home, you frontin'
Couldn't even cook to do nothin'

Keep that broke ass nigga you got, hope he got your pocket
I'm airin', peace

Fuck money, fuck grammar, fuck fashion
I've got something to say
My words have passion
Arrest me for thinking, arrest me for smoking
Arrest me, arrest me for joking


Stop bitching and get ready for the show
My rhymes are dirty like Christmas snow
Check the flow!
You know the plan is to see Parazitii on CD at low prices next to Black Eyed Peas
Fuck money, fuck tax fees
We throw shit on everybody from the nineties
Like this -
We are the white boys making noise
We chase ugly bitches with rubber dildos, big dick toys
I'm so fucking funny, what the fuck, I'm vicious
I don't believe in God, oh God, I'm not religious
Now it's time to come down from cloud nine
Where the weather is fucking fine
We can buy happiness with one dime
Only one time so keep in mind:
Life is like running on ice
It's like roll the dice
If you don't like prison, fool, you'd better be nice
I'm sending this message to the shit hole you call home
You invisible cocksucker stand by the phone
Grab a beer, pop the top, you can drink a little bit
If you feel shitty then you must be full of shit
Here is the message I'm trying to transmit:


Fuck money, fuck grammar, fuck fashion
I've got something to say
My words have passion
Arrest me for thinking, arrest me for smoking
Arrest me, arrest me for joking



My rhymes can make your instinct thick, 
Make no mistake this musical state is not fucking fake
You can suck my dick and relocate
For me drinking is a sport  Victory!
Drinking up my money for child support
If my ship is sinking, don't come aboard
And save all your fucking prayers for the Lord
I'm always ready to drink my way through life
As I hold my dick and piss all night
As a new born child I never sucked milk from my mom's tit
'Cuz my dick gets hard - this I have to admit
I'm so sick, but my mind is bright
And I can bang your wife at cityhall in the daylight
People like good news and happy endings
I like fine bitches on their knees, I'm standing
All women are bitches except my lady back home
And of course your bitch if you don't listen to this alone


Fuck money, fuck grammar, fuck fashion
I've got something to say
My words have passion
Arrest me for thinking, arrest me for smoking
Arrest me, arrest me for joking


Listen up, here we go
Raekwon,Parazitii
I feel the hip-hop classic BPM
Listen up
Raekwon,Parazitii
I feel the hip-hop classic BPM




Then who will beat him?
I don't know, you know I can't reveal that sort of thing to you
Well I haven't got my money yet


Head splash, caught him... (eight million stories or something)
Eight million stories, nigga
Word up, from the hard streets of Norfolk
Motherfucker to New York, all over the world, nigga
We win, all day everyday, nigga (Son is missing right now, man)
Ya bitch-ass nigga, watch what happens (Get on it man, for real)
Check the shit, yo, aiyo, aiyo...


They found his head splashed, caught him by the side of the building
He had a mask on, four-five why did you kill him?
It was supposed to happen, clicked the shit back
Yo, this is the deal, you get on the floor and lay in the grass
Had me handcuffed, take two puffs of the kush
I see you out here, your name's real, can't let you get touched
He had a team, Japanese fiend, all of them greened down
Chiba lit, blood on his Adidas was thick
One second homey, walked over, weapon was boney
Long nose joint, "Hold him", grabbed the nigga head, broke his Roley
Where the blow shorty? Shorty start smiling, "Y'all niggas is puss"
Yo, Lex, these niggas, ain't vets, they gush
Chunk of meat flew off his cheek bone, broke a seat
Had a hole in his 'Lo shirt and took all his weed
Untied him, he fell, legs weak and son wouldn't tell
Now it gets deep, son start falling asleep
They woke him back up, smacked him with the Mac, "Where ya slut?"
I heard you copped a new Beamer and them glasses is rough
They was the Furla joints, eighteen karats, bought 'em right in Brazil
He had the steel on 'im, niggas went savage, they had him spread out
T position, opened his jeans up
Shot him in the leg bone, he rose up like Kung Tut
Still riffing, this why for real my niggas'll still get it
All of us yelling, he ill wit it
Mouth bloody, muddy Gucci joints on, them shits was nine hundred
Couldn't wait to kill him, his sons wanted it
Champion hoody was gone, they broke his neck in like five places
Pushed him down the rail and it skipped his face


Yo, chill, nigga, chill
Police, police, the bullhorn... {*sirens wailing*}
(Aiyo, son, niggas better start flushing the fucking toilet, man)
They just fucking killed this nigga, my nigga
(Better stop leaving ya dirty fucking Fila hoodies around, man)
Hit this nigga in the back of his fucking head
You, man? (Yo, man, the nigga whole fucking head desintegrated, nigga)
(There's a hundred police outside) Listen, B, aiyo..
They running through the building, man
(Y'all niggas gotta shut the fuck up, man)
(Then you wonder why niggas be getting busted?
Man, y'all niggas is yelling, man
We in the back cooking, B, come on, man
What the fuck? Langston, go to the store
I'm stilling waiting for the baking soda)






The sun used to shine on my street, on my street
The moon was visible at all times
Light bulbs substituting my moonlight
Rays of the sun replaced by lamps


Gangsters, buffalos, flexing in bear hats
We call 'em Russians, New Yorkers'll wear that
Gambling outside Macy's, me and all these career rats
Don't know 'em but I'm about to break 'em
Ice roller bound, rolling in cracks
Yanks said stack it, this ain't how I get down
The crowd got silent, heavy face slap
He slapped his Wis in the face for looking down
Caesar with the half-moon, large gash wound on his face
Pretty boy, yo scarred for life
He ain't a sucker though, this nigga a killer
Caught his enemies up in the box, ill y'all, did 'em right
Now he rich, his partner's the real here
Curly haired Indian who sat in a wheelchair just scheming
Yeah Don, hop in the BM, come see me
Before you know it machine guns I'm seeing




Rolling yard weed out the jars
All I see is bag beaches, king, black sand, Wallabee Clarks
We in intense mad colorful pictures, everybody get nice
Gift bags for the bitches that's ice
A-yo the shotty in Alex hand, chill in the foyer
Give your lawyer this bread and be cool, just stay a warrior
The East is in the building, bottles with sparkles on 'em
Yo Rae, I fuck with your waves with the goggles killing
That's what it is, Manhattan all the way to the Grand Rapids
We stay stunting with the clappers
Fishscale parties, commercial niggas bother me
We just as hard as they come, that's my discography
Medelln music, part-time Cuban
Who only eat steaks and grapes, boo how you moving
Perfectionist, applause, kings cooling, new movement
Up in the Wraith I'm outta here, peace to Jeweler








I know that sooner or later
I'm going, to meet my maker


I never thought in the beginning I would see his fall in the end
Pay a man to paint pictures on the wall of my friends
1990s sins it was all for tha ends
Ends for the rims, rims for the Benz, Benz full of skins
'Fore you talk about money, make a mil first
You don't dig me, sig me, either kill me or get killed worse
Your song's in need of a real verse
Son of the man, God feel me like he feel church
And right after speech time, it's sparking the street crime
Niggas throwing anything at you, except a peace sign
Live by the gun, die by the gun
'Til my time come, I'mma spend time with your son
I can just see them sad when they remind you of them
Them would've did the same thing, We're confined to the slum and those that don't adapt are either blind, deaf or dumb
Spine of a squirrel, mind of a girl set to run


Why run nigga?
It's gon' come nigga
But 'til the day it does
I'mma hold my shit down, take it in blood
Outsiders get no love


Fishin' in a swamp in a desert, Lizard sweater
Half a billy in fives, 2 macs in da ride
They call him Coke-Komo, Co-signed by kings in the rich homo
Made me 3 mil in a month, Pockets mumped
Ferrari still by tha projects buildin', real dot tech ill
They dumb out wit uzis and wheels yo
Steakll take meetings, beefin' too much dough  the legion
Bat in my hand  the sweet eastern
Losing money fellas, we wont have that, better grab that
Or dont come back, or get clapped at
Me and my vixens in tha kitchen
One sucking dick  I paid to her ass shots and sent to the Brinxton
Dons eating calamari, coke in a lawrys jar
Never broke, hardly rob, eat with the godlys god
Get wit the gods or get wit the mob
From Shalom to queens, we wild wit the beams




Don't blame me, blame Southside
That's what made me ma, crazy high
But Ill spot a traitor out my lazy eye, ladies spy
Im the one you wanna have that baby by  Maybe I'm
Better of alone, Keeps me in my zone
Nights roam, white patron, GT in my chrome
Alien phone home, ET in my throne
I achieved what they wanted, ease into they stomach
When you broke time slow, but ya weeks are numbered
And bad news keeps you weak and numb
Like when i lost my old man, Damn near threw up the whole weekend son
I shoulda listened, friends turned foe, was told so
The fo' fo' make a nigga run like Ocho - cinco
In my mink ho I'm a protege of pimpin'
Livin' for the sippin', now that they rolled away to Clinton
Marijuana shippin' Champagne lobster shrimpin'
Game trained not to listen, maintain pop the clip in





 Two thousand and two!
 Lookin like a tennis player
 Representin the Wu!
 You gangsta nigga?
 Two thousand and two!
 You? You isn't!
 Representin the motherfuckin Wu!

Aiyyo catch me coolin in Aruba, one sneaker on
Lookin raw beautiful, a blue Ruger, who you lookin at?

Y'all niggas is fake - all y'all do is steal from us
Remember this line, I'm that nigga word to my mother
Slap one of y'all fake ass niggas
Reefer from Egypt daddy we rock magnums
All big niggas heavy on the wrist play diss niggas
Ghost story blow 'em, RZA throw the fork through 'em
Me, Wonder Woman cousin, jewelried out, talk to him
Hammers that bust endlessness, cover terrorism what?
Slide in the 7, measure the whips

I'm a dollar and a dream from seein a brick
In grimy hallways, slingin nicks and treys
When it's on then it's on and poppin, shots lickin
I'm spittin this shit for the hood, Glock clickin
Tension in the street, we stressed, still wanna eat
I walk through the valley of death, the hotstepper
Holdin red pepper, everybody on reach
I need a beat to expand, the mind guide the hand
Pen stroke, excellent quotes of literature
Nights over Egypt, black as Arabia
Gundeliro self I savior, I need the (uh)

Aiyyo, aiyyo
Aiyyo I got the whip smellin like lemon
Roger Clemens jerseys the man blew seven cold coolies in the Worthy and
I crush those rappers, keep the toast near the rad-iator
We like our guns warm, it's easier to make the papers
Stayed off, the cape came off, Ghost G'd off
The track's like doin six months and I'mma beat off
At the airport attention always flow in my direction like
You let the best then sparkle his perfection and
Bitches be askin them, Ghost you got so much shit
You need to cash in, bracelets matchin 'em


Yo, yo
Line Cadillacs to blocks, Richard Pryor, Redd Foxx
Jukebox records, flatfooted cops
Get automatic systematic jumpin in your socks
Mama's apple pie in the park hopscotch
Reunited on the radio, Wu-Tang superb
In the sprinklers girls double-dutchin on the curb
Sinatra, the pop the Jackson 5 recordings
Uptown Saturday, "Cotton Came to Harlem"
Ringmaster circus was, Bailey and Barnum
Crack a Coca-Cola, summer heat was my boredom
Dr. J before Jordan, Al Green on the organ
When Rerun did the dance, the whole world saw him
The blackout fears, Foxxy Brown, Pam Grier
Ford motor gear, your life and times queer
"Smokey the Bear", Burt Reynolds gray hair
Throw 'em some gems, throw up your fists and say yeah, it's

"Since you're all so skilled
Let's fight your way - Shaolin style. Come on!"




Ay-yo, life's good, cashmere sweaters in the rover
Pull up at the club, getting love, pull em over
Jump out the luxury stroller for ballers
We sit, burn money all day, blow and roll up
Fine broads around, that's fly, that's a low ball
Paper settlin' its real for my gold club come up
You ain't even know nothing, last week all on the street
Yelling 'Let me hold something!'
Now shorty throw your booty up
Niggas with cash
Keep it above, we in Louis stuff
Sit back, blasted, do me something
When it comes to you, me and this rap shit
I'm quick to toolie up
My style, my fly, my weather
Yeah I drive high plus fly
You a devil, you endeavor
Mean days in Ciroc with the kettle
Throwing cream at shorty's, love it, he a rebel


Watch the soundboy, he 'gon kill it
(To every ghetto that's far, we here.)
Yeah, watch the soundboy, he 'guan kill it
(I seen so many scars from it)
Yeah
No, we can't turn back the rain
Now we gotta find another way
Cause we grind it, burn it, street life's
Got me caught up can't you...
Can't you see it's 'bout to blow?
Can't you see it's bout to blo-o-o-o-o-ow?
Raekwon, kill it!


Ay-yo, wha gwan, you know what it is!
Assassin, soundboy gangsta, let's go!


Well mi say bodybag a zip up like a ziploc (Blaow! Blaow!)
Murder soundboy, kill the disc-jock (Blaow! Blaow!)
8 ball lodge inna yu six-pack (Blaow! Blaow!)
Say "it wasn't me" like Rik Rok (Blaow! Blaow!)
Raekwon, we got the game inna we hand
Control the dogs like Cesar Millan
Assassin on the track yo, call it microphone-icide
Why? (Cause we murder every beat dat we on)
Then, soundboy yu dead and inna freezer you gone
Mi say you end up inna tomb, but anuh Giza yu gone
Raekwon a tell me, "Yo Assassin easy nuh man
Yu nuh fraid dem tek weh yuh visa mi don?"
Mi say no, sound fi dead, whole clique a dead
When mi say di sound dead, all di speaker dead
Amps dem, di control, all di tweeter dead
Aye!




It's real, man
The Chef, Assassin, Melanie Fiona
Word up all my soundboy killers
The DJs, hold the fort down man, word up man
100 cases of motherfuckin' Guinness
Nigga you know how we win this
Song feels so real 'til I finish this shit
Aah!



 Uhh
 Deadly melody part two
 That's my word!
It ain't safe no more... bitch!


Yo, yo
Brain gets punctured and drained through the nasal
Hour of assassination be upon you
Movin with the tiger strike, bound, gagged and shot
Red the head in, dapple light centered
East remains hot with police
But I keep a lease for my, four-fifth automatic
Extended clip rewind, bust mine
Anytime you reveal your snakeish ways and actions
Observe the magnetic attraction


And it's time for some grid...


...iron rap, action-packed grudge match
Tough act to follow, hard copy novel
Throw you off the Verrazano
We swimmin with these sharks, yo I rate bodyguard
Stamp my initial in your birthmark
P.L.O., bust like a calico, tally ho
Black expo, Tecs in afros, we back yo
It's Dolemite, crash your windpipe, with the mic device
Fatal strike, daily mic fights, shoot out the street lights


Sight beyond sight, late night, city light
Tight like a virgin, mergin with my A-Alikes
Splurgin, dirty to the grain, no detergent
Filthy, innocent until I'm proven guilty
Submergin, deeper in the lecture I'm servin
Truth or consequences, life or death sentence
I'm hurtin, your person, I'm certain, it's curtains

Chorus: Method Man

It ain't nuttin like hip-hop music
You like it cause you choose it
Most DJ's won't refuse it
A lot of sucker MC's misuse it
Don't think that Wu can't lose it
Too much to gain to abuse it
The name of the game is rapture
This one is complete, it captures bass


Yo, I bring chaos to blocks like the riots in Watts
Rapid fire shots ripple through Kevlar, 9 Glocks
Technique of rhyme pop machine gun ammo
Sporadic flow buckled a foe, intro to outro
Calico, throw verse, but slide my dough first
I make thousands in the club with no shirts, go bezerk
From the Shao' borough, whylin out on the furlow
Commando, styles thorough, solo inferno
It burns slow, thermonuclear degrees
Heads are underseas down to the youngest seeds
Wannabes clone, they light like summer breeze
Hundred G's for the Garden, them fans stampede
For the top cats, hit the mic like the iron-palm blast
Equipped to perform the task
S-I-N-Y, and what, head or gut
The head rush, will cause your cerebellum to bust


We be the world's most fabulous
Hazardous, to fuck with these ravenous
Killers get you stuck to the wall like wooden cabinets
Extravagant, je-wel drop a helicopter high
Up into the sky, lines philosiphize, I got stocks to buy
Watch my pockets rise, to the bottom bust confide in God
In Sin I trust, the villianous, criminal minded killers rust
I intend to build and fortify in men
Mastermind rhymin, navigate the globe then retire quick


Aiyyo fluid rap bend through it black, buluga black Ac'
Tackle that, ghetto tabernackles throw it in your lap
Slang A-K, national, geographical
Mathematical, slide up in your work casual
Nike Air Dog, who wear it all, plus down to brawl
All a thousand with a bloody hair, flammable
Rap mayors, who clap Himalayas pinky fingers
Ever glacer, lacer, hand laser touches grail bomb blazers
Sly-workin, network bezerk, mad hurtin
Killer whales, fucking up sales, crash Bloomingdales
Masqevendo, John Lennon tenor break, mad descendo
Fuck y'all niggas carve my ice through your Benz window

*door creaking open*
*gunshots followed by a car alarm*

Chorus


Uhh.. Spazz-Ola.. (Spazz-Ola)
S-I-N-Y 10304
Lock your doors
Crack your jaws
Drop your drawers
It's all day everyday with this rap souflee




Drink to this nigga
Yo, what's your record company lord? (Gladiators)
Keep it straight.. straight up
Game time


I don't know what you doin' out there on the street
I'm gonna kick your ass!


Wallabee encounters, yo we from New York
We never bounce son
We carry cage ways, straight up and don't get down son
Supposed to have blow out and pound son
Ten rastas had masses, fly Nikes, splashes and Porsche glasses
Singles leather opponent, straight from the street baby
Polo jacket, baseball hat matchin' lookin' froze, dumb, unusual
I'm lyin', face the music boo, pendulum loops and swoops
Shells ain't nuttin' to conceal ya fool
I'm young but mostly swift from blunted
Think like chess, drink, note languages blessed
I'm from and era where niggas'll get caught for leathers
Shots are hollerin', hung knees up supportin' the weather
Who the fuck gots mines? Bringin' like Duran with Ross
Bet all y'all niggas are dyin' in cars
Fuckin' with me? It's like luxury
Flow like water in and out of doors, dare a nigga fuck wit' me

 (x2)
Eh, nah test this boy, spit fire
He got a sound like lightnin' and thunder
Eh, nah test this boy, spit fire
Honey bad sound boy test he get murdered


Yo, beat Gods sneakers look decent and he hard
Feel my giants, sway down, big pieces on yo
The bringers I flooded with more dough
Feel my effect, Lex get busy, wheel his own check now blow
Mountains get bagged, I'd rather count and just grag
Slap on crabs, Jags in the snow
Feelin' leather Khuzis and Uzis
Movies that bein' produced like rubees
One of the illest gaters salute me yo
Drive borrowed connects
Bought out Manhatten wit' cheques
Man I miss you, bank's next
Finger paintin' low like one of the Saints
Jim down, all white minks lookin' like 10 thou'
Staten Island Gotti, gats, we ain't leavin' without it
Take this here, you need cops, you ain't 'bout to stay in there
Get popped and the violence in rare
I can take care of yours, you take care of there's


Word is out, other rappers usin' their clout
Your hands ain't dipped no more, you just pissin' me off
From a jurisdiction where niggas come up missin'
Rides, get housed right
Niggas even battle for bitches
And their game is to get yours, ride through the zors
You sure? Suggest you're wise to see what time it is Lord
The plane ain't the same, the game kinda weakened your name
What you better do is spit flames

 (x2)
Eh, nah test this boy, spit fire
He got a sound like lightnin' and thunder
Eh, nah test this boy, spit fire
Honey bad sound boy test he get murdered


We spit fire, yeah it's on and nah testin' up the wrist
Me nah have to touch in my wrist, son me have to push to waste
And all the boy spit fire, me lick a shot to retire
So them can not move no further
I spit fire, then me call Ghostface Killah
Tell him that me just start to murder
Me spit fire, then me call Raekwon the Chef
Tell the boy run for the lawyer
Don't test this fire


Word is out, other rappers usin' their clout
Your hands ain't dipped no more, you just pissin' me off
From a jurisdiction where niggas come up missin'
Rides, get housed right
Niggas even battle for bitches
And their game is to get yours, ride through the zors
You sure? Suggest you're wise to see what time it is Lord
The plane ain't the same, the game kinda weakened your name
What you better do is spit flames


The first thing what we gotta do man
Is know what we gonna do with this +CREAM+ when we get it
I'm not tryna just be.. sitting on motherfuckin' 200 thou'
And actin' like I'm just gonna be a.. a drug dealer all my life son
I got bigger and better plans yo -> Raekwon from Striving for Perfection
Take that to the bank nigga




(Conversation between Rae and Ghost)


Yo! Can you feel me?
Storytelling rap Magellan I ain't telling
Them niggas ran in the spot for selling
Word up, pushed up, man got mushed up
Seen him at a rap show acting like fat cat though
Glasses gold, shining like a real big boy
This nigga had mega ice on Chips Ahoy!
Cats surrounded, this political brown kid
All out the wind yo, my man walked in
Pulling mints out son had mad clientele
Order me Cristal twice Kion, chill!
Watch them niggas, a-yo that clique's from outta state
They bubble weight in Far Rockaway with Blake Carrington
You know the kid with the most dough getters
And terrors on fat shit clique they rock Lo sweaters
That's my man, that's my man too
Call him up on the strength of the Wu
And watch me gain duke
Grab the cell, I got a heist to pull off well
At the end of the week, I'm buying you a L
Lexus nigga, I ain't talking bout Hancock
No time for weed plus no time to get locked
That night, up in the staircase
Cousin had me laced out, skeed all outta my face
We gon' get dat crunchy chump for all of his lump
Don't try to front, you was sweating this Hilfidiger
Guess who walked in having it, his man from Farragut
Confront him with the Ruger on his back, walk in black
Where's your man, where's the sky blue Land at?
Stop playing Wu in the back, smacked him wit the gat
(Yo, money said he be here in fifteen!)
He's not lying, wait for the Millenia green to pull up
He got the Donna Karan shit on, two rings
Six carats a piece plus the chain swings
Like anchors on ships flooded with all diamond chips
Back pockets: two clips - four-fifths wit rubber grips
Laying, two bottles of brass I was slaying
Meditating, red dot be waiting for my payment
Heard the key in the lock, cocked the Glock
Turn the lights out, dip behind the couch
Kion, gag his mouth
Infra-red at his head when he entered
Butter soft Perry Ellis leather with Dorinda
A friend of, Kion's wife, Kenya, the bitch larger than life
Yo, shorty be fucking mad Colombian niggas
Fuck it, get on the floor meet the black Lex Luthor
Strip fast, the bitch had on Claiborne drawers
Yo Rae I'm about to scrape her, chill Ghost
Thought for a second, turned around
Threw the nine in his meatloaf
Yo, where's the cash and the stash that's mixed?
I don't know!
Shot his hand, he started screaming like a bitch!




Yo. Yo. Yo. Yeah, No doubt. No doubt
That's my... 1997. That's my word
That's my... that's my word
That's my... that's my word


Yo, yo, yo, up in the Hilton, buildin, playin outfieldin
The black 90210 cat was chillin
Then spottin this, somethin look fabulous with ice on
Fly night's on, fitted up with fly tights on
Starin at me, approach a God, represent right
Peep this, James Bond, BM look tight
Delightly, that I could see shorty liked me
Politilly, , get it right g


Day plannin, jump up, watch the landin
Stay cool, fannin, polly, eatin salmon
At the grill, reminise over who got killed
And if they were here today, pa, how would they feel?
Sun shinin, jet past the block, cats rhymin
See King Gunner, he gained cream this summer
Rolled up a Dacari, blessed my man
Marvelous, wally rocker, lex, 450 land


Yo, the barbeque's bangin and my sons look charged up
What up? Fresh cuts buildin when we rest up
Team is righteous, fresh cologne on, probably roll on
Some next club, no slag, throw my gold on
Info, like a hotel, phat, she got stacks
She's a big girl, cover girl laced, wig curl
Goin through the struggles of life is trife
Get your things right, maybe one day you'll be rich wife


Yo, picture good days, young, no bills to pay
I can't 'til I grown, that's what all kids say
Came a long way, cashin checks, duplex
To lampin on planes, rockin 5 g chains
Well known, just bought moms a new home
Check shorty on the swing, playin the cellphone
Lookin lovely, green sundress, no stress
Nails look fresh, painted to impress
It's only love


Yo, yo, son, that's my word
Connect dots with all live  in the world
Start some thesis, exiled, long releases
Though we got family there with little nieces
Six a crash with king Nike Air, yo
Rockin them new Wu glasses, lace my lab, kid
Magazinin', swim, watch, long dreamin
Peace, I'm out, golden globe rapper low-keyin


Yo, Cuban linkin, lampin at the park here drinkin
Watch the seeds play here free, mind thinkin
Birthdays, presents, learnin, readin lessons
Nine God year, livin in impressions
Splashin, La medallion flashin
(Son, talk your jewels 'fore you jump in the pool)
Aight, du', I stay blacked out by the leaf
Cuz I eat to live, not live to eat
Sayin peace, Nah'I'm'Sayin?




For money, I assassinate
Today, I have an opponent that's worthy
Now, killing me, you won't find that so easy


Clap your hands
Let's start the show, c'mon
1, 2, 3, 4, oh


Revolutionary gangster, the will to kill
Everything up, my roots is steel
Do it big time, march through the desert and shine
Let the C's live free while we open the minds
Of every black man, white man, no color, my writing hand
Is like dynamite, I fight for land
Blood stains yo, gettin money affect the plan
You travel to Beijing and end up in Japan
Hoods everywhere, bring the goods and gear
And teach them how to hold mics and grow them beards
Then stop, check my brothers and my sisters in Africa
We know that's theirs, yes, we been actin up
Bush fucked the world up, and left our soldiers
Out in Iraq, bless them with roses
Foes try to approach, we roast them goats
We terrorize the city while forgettin the quotes




They trying to take us down through (Reaganomics) and atomic bombs
On Islamic countries to stop them from being Islamic
But Islam is a way of life, Islam is the way of Christ
Islam means peace, the beast must pay a price
For his wickedness, politics is the trickiest
Business on this planet, the bandits are the slipperiest
Snakes who ever slithered, you ever stop to consider
Who's pulling these strings, from Napoleon to Hitler?
Is there an unseen hand with the unseen plan?
The unclean man from the unclean land
Desire to kill the righteous dumbs down the brightest
Give his life in this world that seem so lifeless
Put a price on things, that are priceless
Convince us that meanness is stronger than the niceness
Who really has the power - is is theirs, is it ours?
Is it a democracy, or the morning prowlers?
Do we have a press or President?
Is it a test or a testament? Pest or pestilence?
Who got the evidence?
Who got the common sense? Stop all the negligence




I oversee the world
You taught me that, basically
I'm moldin rap to be more than I can see
Chef, Senator of Thoughts
Democratic cats
Saved by the judge
The flavor, that was brought about that day
Steaks come out, raw




"WU, TANG!" 




We go hard (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What's happening man? Can I eat too, man?
We go hard, yeah, yeah, Rapper's Island, Rapper's Island)


Staten, we go hard, we go hard
Staten, we go hard, we go hard


Wu put Staten on the map (that's right)
This is gat hoodie rap fuck around, put a fully in your back
You might make my toolie act (word?)
I only run for the bread, lightning strike
Fly one in your hat, black
And if your man test my skill
I promise he will die in the field
My money's long, my homeboy's is real
They broke, but will shoot to kill
Flashing, big uzi's, make movies
Cut niggas faces, pretty boys, groupies
Ride through the city, guns on, kuffies
Living like jail, it's real, y'all coochies
You know I'm, back at it, and asthmatic
Always mad jiggy, I love fashion
Plus love flashing B9's, 38's huggin' weight
I'm straight, watch the nigga traction




S-H-A-O-L, I-N, we, kill again


Wu-Tang, went platinum, Meth platinum
Ghost, Chef, platinum, that's the raw, captain
We war, y'all acting, sister rapping
Ol' Dirty B-A-S-T, platinum
Seliln' nose candy, blackberry, brandy
Turtle necks, 40 belows, flow dandy
Living in the hell, I Am Legend, 7's
Played out, weapons, courtrooms, blessings
Brooklance, we rip 'em, rip 'em
Tire marks flip 'em, figure eights then strip 'em
Kill 'em, sell 'em, might trade 'em, save 'em
Hit an OG where it keep cool, play 'em
Never mind, we on grinding, my linemen
Puff hardest rhymers, call us on assignments
Bujo's, tigers, lions, up in Brooklyn House
Ask about us, niggas know what time it is




Well I'm all grown up, I've learned my ways
Posted on the block every god damn day
Once them cops come driving by
Tuck your shit and get the fuck inside
Post up, I'mma hit you when it's time
When you see the helicopter, be prepared to ride
Get some shots out, we done talking
Staten Island, stand up
I know some mean motherfuckers from the S to the I
R-O-D's, we all ready to die
Park Hill in this bitch, Stapleton
Now Born, stand up, West Brighton
From the heart of the Port Richmond
We go hard, we go hard, we go hard
We go hard, we go hard in this bitch




Yeah, all my niggas behind the wall, yeah
That's for you
S-H-A-O-L, I-N, we, kill again
That's real, you know the half, we might take your life




It's those guys, man
It's the fucking bankers, the politicians
They the ones, don't wanna make coke illegal
So they can make the fucking money
And then they get the fucking votes
You fighting the bad guys, they the bad guys!


Trash... yes!
(And close the fucking door, man) Wu-Tang!
(Fucking idiots, man) Aiyo, Chef, bodododododododododododo....
(Stand... shit man, fuck these motherfuckers, come on, man)
Nigga what!


Cream vanquish, my queen keeps it's stainless
Cracks and Brussels, screwing everything famous
Love to hustle, my ring, call it big Uranus
Cats that scuffle, crawl on you and break fingers
That's what's up, some saw me in them bone rangers
Me and my homey, we bought like forty things up
Long as you owe me, you won't get a damn thing, son
Shoot off your kangol, while you in the plane, fronting
Stop, admire me, ya'll should of fired me
Cause when I come back, it's me and my diary
None of that bullshit, few men got tired of me
My niggas is wrong, they hated, and they lied to me
Explain the saga, fuck yo, your chain liver
Fuck the blinging, have my money by five, to me
Ya'll 'pose to bring it, fuck you and your whole variety
I'm bringing my hammers, I beat it like, five to three


Jealous ass niggas can't see they man prosper
They'd rather see me in a broke down fuckin' Mazda
Don't disrespect me, son, you will get popped up
My resume's off the hook, now, check mi casa
Yeah, call it, what you wanna call it
My bread is larger, nigga, you can never spoil it
Thought you was loyal, now a nigga can't support you
Blastin' you up, and off me, now you look rewarded


What's that smell? Rat piss and possum pussy
Bitch don't yell, I'm not impressed, don't push me
I'm back with some haters, they wipe shit and blast pussies up
Bloody ya blazer, take all your man cush weed
Yeah, I'm coming just to claim a title
Rap is boring, niggas need another idol
When I'm gone, just let off like forty rifles
Aiming at rappers, biting off the God's bible
I destroy you, lyrically, I spit oil
This is war, you can never escape, conio
Ya'll some lamesters, never seen a yard soiled
When it's on, now we gon' see who's loyal
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming, yo, to get it from you
Place that crown in the garbage, or you sitting on
A few things mattered, you was just a corner don
That got shot dead like Malcolm in the Audubon






Wherever you want it, believe I'm running through there hard
Dismantle your cypher, yo, Rae, happy new year God!
Foul and fucked up, niggas know I spit ugly
Jewelry trucked up, niggas know they can't fuck with me
If you my target, you probably wouldn't wanna be 'em
My legacy royal with statues in a museum
With numerous artifacts, hanging in the mosoleum
Type living room setting is bigger than the land of freedom
I'm parked on the corner, while pretty bitches holla "hello"
I'm another breed, different species from you fellows
Technically, it's kinetic, I'm genetically better
I'm something you will never see, far as you can remember
My buzz exceding rapidly, no matter how it's measured
Like an unstoppable machine in the Mohabi Desert
So hungry I smell it, success up in my after taste
Still spit til it's painful, despite the money in the safe
I see you resentful, stay up in your place
And while they be morning your death, we in a State of Grace
Designing, I'm perfect with timing, take it back to Rucker
RZA, it's hard to stop rhyming on this muthafucka!
Stay on the poster, the street, we never sleeping on him
New album, Big Bang, slowly creepin' on 'em
Wu-Tang, Flipmode, fuck you wanna do?
Another banger, Chef, RZA, Bust', Cuban Link 2!


CREAM vanquish, my queen keeps it's stainless
Cracks and Brussels, screwing everything famous
Love to hustle, my ring, call it big Uranus
Cats that scuffle, crawl on you and break fingers
That's what's up, you saw me and them Lone Rangers
Me and my homey, we bought like forty things up
Long as you owe me, you won't get a damn thing, son
Shoot off your kangol, while you in the plane, fronting
Stop, admirin' me, ya'll should of fired me
Cuz when I come back, it's me and my diary

Up in the bleachers, in the penthouse, frontin'
Stove burnin' a half a bird
Uleica out the legs, it's burnin'
We eatin' escovitch, green pea soup
Korean coupe in the front
With twelve rich whores ready to stunt
Roll the blunts, ladies
U, strain the pussy
Reign gleamy, my man
Onto 700 grand, out, breathe easy
Then the phone rang, bling, bling, bling
Hey yo king, two more ice packs comin'
Forty bundles of onion
Roll the reefer to the maximum
Sax playin', lay on the drums
The Jeffersons on, Im ready to cum
She lookin' at me with a relevant stare
Know my pockets the only hair
To come up out the hood, stay here
Piss the merlot out, twirl my little thing downstairs
'Cuz anything other than there, we all willionaires ("will"ion - "heirs"; a.k.a., Paris Hilton and trust-fund children)
Can't forget that, the ziplocks is get-back
None of that overnight shit, we sell in seconds pa, hit back
Sean, hey yo, it's stupid hot
Take the shotty witchu', you and Barkim make it pop
Them niggas from the golden era
Lemonade leathers who dont give a fuck if they die, they more high
Theyre soliders in the streets, they rebels
Bubble for motherfuckin' money with bitches rockin' stilettos
So when the drought hit, they on their shit
The sheeps come out lovin' the See-Cypher-Powers (C-O-Ps, a.k.a., cops), they cowards
Stay off the fuckin' flowers

Rockin' a skull full of waves
Four frames with his chain
Jamaican accent, fresh out Toronto, we black skin
Young Black Panther M.O., love wheelin' rentals
He on the crack spot, we know it as the trap shop
Adidas down sterling brown
Uncles is traffickers
Lifestyle growing spectacular
Green grass smokers with green hash
Them niggas don't need cash, they only play fresh and rock mean glass
The dream stash only when the good boy last
These are all ruthless niggas who dont seem glad
Left the Aspen in back of the gas station
Never no shorties in it
It's only Glocks with mags
Here the Feds come, niggas is bagged
No, give 'em his bad, diesel ninjas in rags
Rockin' flags




Uh, yup, uh-huh, word


Up in the bleachers in the penthouse, fronting
Stove burning a half a bird, you laker out, the legs is burning
We eating escovich, green pea soup, Korean coupe in the front
With twelve rich whores, ready to stunt
Roll the blunts, lady, you straighten the pussy, ran Glenny my man
Honest seven hundred gram, be easy
Then the phone rang, BLING BLING BLING, aiyo, King, two more ice packs

It's Flipmode bitch! Categorize my word as gospel
YEAH!!


Yo! I offer niggas the encouragement
While I give you the nourishment I put niggas on punishment
Y'all niggas is trash but I offer the streets the supplements
Takin over the block now I'm tryin to control the government
(SAY WHAT!!!!!!!!!) Got these niggas pissin they mattresses
The God is back nigga get the deliverin my packages!!!
Now I'm back from L.A. all access
It's that nigga back from the Oscars after fuckin some actress-es
While I give you the seasonin and there recipes
Over the music they sound like Sticker from in the seventies
While sippin 'nac that make niggas hiccup and spit for centuries
Of course the ratchet they click up and my enemies
The way I flood the streets you know the flava good
I'm a stash some of the coke and cause a drought up in the neighborhood
I'm only in the streets to feed a nigga
Regardless what you think the game will always need a nigga
(Yeah! Might as well mortalize me into a statue nigga!!!!)


Yeah, let's go love..
I wear a MEAAAN dark pair of shades
Janglin bats back in the days, I wore braids
Runnin with solicitors, grizzlies, monkey business prisoners
Livin Uptown with scales inside wall ridges
Y'know we network our ass off
Slabs of salt, dynamite sticks from bricks, fiends gas off
Blowin sellin dope, runnin to the vault pass off
Play wit my paper, write your little ass off
Stylin cause I know how to dress
Learned it from Jamacians who stressed the building lights and gallons of cess
We play rock star hard, every big bangle we mangle (uh-huh)
Mad dog wit the uzi named King Tango
Fishin for riches, mission is to dig bitches (yep)
Hide from the NARCs', Clarks on blue cases
You know we love you like cook food, matta fact
Cook cocaine, never drainin the good mood


(Hold up! Hold up! Hold up!) Chill, chill nigga
Damn! (What's goin on? Y'all tryna make a song WIT'OUT ME?!)
I ain't get enough fuckin wreck, man!
(I'm on this, GOBBS, what's goin on?)


I get that fatty, I got that hammer
I die for that bread man, that's word to my grandma (GRANDMA!)
I kill for it too, that's word to my lil' man (Oh!)
I risk my freedom for him, send me to prison man
I gotta get it man (I do!), Look, by any means necessary
Pop a nigga while I'm robbin him if it's necessary (BANG!)
Yeah - gimme the loot, gimme the loot
He was like, "Aight Murda, don't shoot, don't shoot (Don't MOVE!)
No head shots, please don't shoot me in my head
It ain't that serious, I ain't tryna die for that bread (What?!)
I don't want no beef, man take my burna
I'mma put the word out, no more hatin on Murda (They hatin)
You get weed on my block, all of dem man
I did it for 26, you can charge me 40 a grand (Aight, I got it!)
I know what beef is and I don't want it, son
I'm serious, I don't care if I sound corny son" (You DO doe!)
(Damn! My Philly cap gone!)




Oh yeah, coming through with my Shaolin crew
Two cent for a case, gimme St. Ide's brew
In the midst of broken bottles and crushed up cans
Methtical's in a jam, oh how dry I am


With St. Ides in my system
Crack another I'm blessed, let's go get the next one
And get over, the object is to stay sober
Lay on the sofa, better yet, dial my chauffeur


Call me the Wallabee Champ, sretched out, could never be son
Ricochet daily hit the deli for a cold one
Naturally blessed, yes, my rap is like a laser beam
That blows in the bushes, St. Ide's fill the canteen


Crack the bottle of the St. Ide's, sipping to those
Who don't realize that drinking ain't only to be drunk
You can't drive, keep my peoples alive
And if the Saint don't know you from a can of paint


It was hot on the spot so I jetted up the block
I saw Ak with an Ide's, I could tell by the dot
On the back he be building, not that charcoal filtered
Ice cold bottle tilted, to my cup he spilt it
Ahh St. Ides




K Slay don't want me out here
They don't want you out here dog
His mother fucking face long
K Slay, New York City
Holler at your god damn boy
We don't rock no mother fucking ice baby
We rock this real shit dog
And (?)
Some fuck with it
Its going down


(?)
The elevator with the crib
Bling with it kid
I built one in the Bill Clintons
Mills was spent, still don
Still (?), still yacht flying
Still kill a bitch
Still kill a flick
The fifth out, don't even breathe
Out in Ghana with the ill thieves
Slick hammers, we all fam
What
Pull out the four, pop the chump
See the luxury mall
The casket leather, the python seats velour
Flash back
He in them Benz lenses
Acting like he did ten sentences
Something ain't real
We go excited, parked the truck
Just leaned a light and twist a blunt
Sat back son, (?)
This money on it
And to them young niggas strong on it
Devour the snitches
You got on, you born with it
Make a toast for ours
For all the money and powers
The right division
Don't ever let corns get it




I know how it feels to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like you're the user
Selling drugs to all the losers mad Buddha abuser
But they don't know about the stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray
So you can reminisce and wish
You wasn't living so devilish s-shit
I remember I was just like you
Smoking blunts with my crew
Flipping over SIXTY-TWO's
Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G, I had to get P-A-I-D
That's why my mom hates me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out Nick's went for twenty down south
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
Four chumps trying to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't trying to hear it
Smoking mad Newports cause I'm doing court for an assault
That I caught in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the ginger bread man
You better have your gat in hand
Cause man


A man with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M
Still struggling, Survival got me buggin'
(Souls of a soldier in the streets of survival)
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
(The rough life, I just be up nights. It got me)
Still strugglin'
(Campaign)
Lay out your maintain
(In the everyday struggle)


I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
Had secondhands, moms bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I begin to G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son, rolling with this one
And that one, pulling out Gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen, who was a fiend
Started smoking woolies at 16
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough all
Sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick tight clique and went all out
Catchin' keys from across seas
Rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo brothers respect mine, or anger the TEC-9
(Get live, muthaf~)

Yo the style's older than sharkskin, now commit the barking
I gather rhymes and load up 'cos it's a hold up
I meditate fast to assassinate a class of dope sort
Check the graphics on this rap chalkboard
Peace to RZA razor, yo, the nigga's major
Who slice tracks fast like whitey's with Gillette razors
And won't stab me, the ragged Dragon Lee
Regenerate, lay in the area, air out and ventilate
See, yo I'm magical, swift like a mackerel shark
Gat packable, attackable in this art
Now watch a beat that makes and shakes and breaks you
Ron G makes a million off his name son
Ayo, peace to uptown, Shaolin now, walk through child is wild
Huh hit you like this son, Ron G, '94, takin' em to war


I got miles and piles of my styles to utilize
And brutalize niggas who despise 'cos I'm super fly
There ain't a nigga in the game who can tame me
I flip A&Rs if they try to rearrange me
So how the fuck do you figure you can hang
With a nigga whose slang is equipped to pick a nigga's brain
I come hard to the fullest scar
From pulling cars to leaving niggas scarred on the boulevard
Check my steez my rep is kept pleased
Like these biceps that I flex when I crack your knees
A homicide in the making, you enter the chambers
And sentenced to death for move faking
See mad thoughts fill the mind of a Killa
Sin, it's iller than your ordinary blood spiller
When it's time to come into the track
I'm like a maniac slapping your stack when it's all back

What, 1994, give it to your raw
Mix king records, word up


Easy soundbwoy 'ere wit ya chat
Allow me to set the party off with the fly rap
Aye Aye cap, suckers wanna battle give me mine
You rhymes wouldn't be fly if you said them on Delta Airline
Now this'll take a second Kris has come to bug out
You waiting for some lovey dovey, hug me, get the fuck out
I got the hardest texture, lecture or whatever
I got to survive G I ain't no saint
I do graffiti art but like Martin's home decorating center
I ain't, Just, paint, wait wait
Wait wait let me speak, let me speak
While I'm on this beat your career is looking bleak
I couldn't understand why you were coming soft and sweet
But that explains why your rhyming skills are weak
You need a quicker picker-upper, rip a sucker
Put my album on toast 'cos it's butter
You dissing me will never happen slightly
That's like Arsenio Hall on TV saying "kill whitey"
You might be slightly thrown off at my complexity
Lyrical ecstasy is achieved by standing next to me
You should of known your career was gonna end
Should of called Dionne Warwick and her psychic fucking friends
Now it's ended, can't be mended, how splendid
For wack MC's I come doctor recommended


I'm hard, Jehovah said I'm barred from the Pearly Gates
Fuck him, I didn't wanna go to heaven anyway
But my momma got me on my knees with my hands gripped
Talking 'bout some "Praise the Lord" shit
Hail Mary, fuck her I never knew her
I'll probably screw her and dump her body in the sewer
Our father, my pops stuck up dope spots big, black and mean
With the fifth by the gabardines
What you expected from his next of kin
I'm loco bro but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin'
The lesson from the Smith and Wesson is depressin'
Niggas keep stressin' the same motherfuckin question
How many shots does it take to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake, Ron G stop the breaks


O.C. representing from Jamaica, Queens like this
You have now stepped into the realm of a man
With topics, open your optics, I rhyme for what I stand
Brace your boxes and stereo decks
I'm here to do more than just collect checks
So get fixed to the wheel of force see I'm the Jedi
When I'm in flight it might be like the red eye
Swift, take a wiff of my vocabulary
I'm wild like berries I pop it like a cherry
Ron G composed it everyone knows it
Life brings death from guns to roses
Shoot outs put doubts of a nigga to a test
Shit is hex so I just might get a vest
But what good is a vest if you're aiming for the dome?
Kick it from a  nickel plated chrome
Blast you in the face, massacring niggas
Figuring the referee foes that's bigger




Yeah
We back
Now let me tell you niggas for real


Hey yo, for real
Check it
Back of the limo blowing grass
Play the demo, broke a glass
Gazelles is crashed
Check the rim homie
Jumoed out
Hammer on me glamour
Velvet blazer, light green Brooks Bros. shirt
Pair of Stans on me
Contemplating jump in a cab or jump in the Navi
She hate me
Got caught doing threesomes in the Jag
Rolling joints (?)
No points
Nigga now you gotta go
She kicked me out of my shit yo
I said cool, no more love I gotta move
I left smooth
Punched a hole in the wall and blew
I had the Call of Duty Wrangler outside
Snakeskin skin, gold madam, black Timberland, laying down why
In a stripper warehouse in Vegas
Celebrities cater
Serenading bitches, I was just fanangling
39K a night I take it
Straight with the wraith
Take it home
Nigga I fucked up with my wife


Overlooking our problems baby
Overlooking our pain
Baby lets get together
Things are not the same
We're just hurting each other over again
Two wrongs don't make it right
We find a love and then...


Here we go again (here we go)
Stop trippin', stop trippin'
Here we go again
(x2)


Confrontation's always guaranteed
We've always had our rainy days
Yes we did, I know we did




Chump to ice glassed up, get blast up

I starved the wing. spread out and carved your mink
I'm ill with the night black, I park you for rent
But who that there? we like yeah
Ski bike Nike hype wear, like me or write me a queer
From Brazil to America's most realest, we act a little certain
Type queen try to murk you in buildings

Surgical gloves, snubs in the grass with his blood
Homie hold that, the four black, we black down
Gold Jag', Ol' laughing yo, yo, what the fuck happened?
They clapped him and the scalp it flew that way
Yo why they capped him? It went through his lap
Snatched his Audemars Piguet, took his man gold, get at
He painted it, slayed blocks, aiming it
Hit a child, this is foul, but he styled with his flamer flaming shit
Teddy with the red Range, supercharged Kangols
Rae & Ghost CD in his change, yo, Angel
Spanish kid lingo, all I know is where he hang though, kept it sideways, angle
Good brush, tough talk, keep it real, daddy, got them thangos
I respect on how the game goes, the same goes
For get fresh niggas, test niggas, extra bless niggas, with them egos
We blow you out your peacoats
Haha, dios mos, we get them twelve a ki, yo
Keep it moving, slide off in the G.O.'s
Freeloaders, the D's over, your shit won't sell no more
Breeze over...


Money, gear, drugs, guns, Goodyears
All my niggas sit, smelling the tears
Cookin snow white, it's just the poor life, never living off fear
We all millionaires, now where my shares?
(Money) You know the code, drug money, gear money, baby
(Money) You know we fold the stash holders, cash blowers, yeah
(Money) So when the D's come, we float and grab the boats, yea
(Money) Spend off, I got my win off, have a potent year


X6's red, up in Albany with the dreds
Bags of black, fuck the feds
Papers in Aruba's, gold tuba from Bermuda
In my living room spreads, cameras action, got the calico cranked
Where the food at? Hood jewelry on, I gots to do that
Long chain hatchet flooded up, you knew that
Baby blue mac, stones on the nozzle stick
Bulletproof brocco's with the Jew bitches, all I got is two cracks
Gazelle lenses, clear rude wraps, bagging every ziplock
And my peoples sit around, cops split that
High potent white kit kats, we sell up in the hood
Going door to door, every floor, every get back
My gangsta shit, get gats, for every man, here go a gram
Meet me by my drophead and drop your lid back
Forty-seven quick claps, spray off on something




Spray on one of ya'll man, the streets is mine, nigga
You know what we do, for real
Straight up, it's how we playing right now, man
Cuz the streets, man, streets is making ya'll niggas see, man

 (Lil Wayne)
Some live for the bill
Some kill for the bill (Rich Nice in your area, area...)
She wined for the bill
Grind for the bill
(Weezy...and she used to be the sweetest girl)
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill
(And she used to be the sweetest girl)
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill


Pimpin' got harder cause hoes got smarter
On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of
Rather be up in the club shakin' for a dub
Get triple times the money and spending it like they wanna
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nine
See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line
But I know there's a drop in the block
You move slow
You gettin' pressure from cops
You don't know whether or not to lay low
Because 25 to life is no joke
To all my real guerillas thuggin'
On top of corners every day strugglin'
All the beautiful women getting money
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry


Cause I'mma tell you, like Wu told me
Cash Rules Everything Around Me
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)


High school she was that girl that make me
Do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
High school she was that girl that make me
Do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
Never thought she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)
She balls, he'd call (where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She bawls, he'd call (where my money at?)




She used to be the sweetest girl ever
Whatever, now she like sour ameretta
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks on the track right by school
She takes a loss cause she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she asks him, "Where my money at?"




Yeah, light that..yes sir!
(AY RAEKWON!!!)
Move flow, then over the stove, open Pyrex
And smoke and chain dangled, vein in my brain tangled
Thinking bout broth in both coasts is all on my money made
I should be revealed to Oprah
But flashing to the times I was broke, no lights
No gas, couldn't buy Ivory soap
But got with a sick-type clique
You know, the smart ones who came through
Fronting with the long jumps
About a week later, we on, we been, hate us
Shoebox and money looking bummy my delegators
Or ride for me, hide from me, bust a 4-5 for me
Police come, see us gone, we survivors, shorty


Some live for the bill
Some kill for the bill
She wined for the bill
Grind for the bill (And she used to be sweetest girl
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay the bill (where my money at?)
Tonight Wyclef, RAE-kwon, Weezy on the bill
WHERE MY MONEY AT??



 + (Raekwon)
On the firing line... lock, one round load
Ready on the right? Ready on the left?
Ready on the firing line? Watch for ya targets
(Yeah, yeah, yeah...) pay attention


Welcome to the fish fry where niggas get burnt to a crisp
Jump out the pot, "Yeah yo I got this"
Long armor, construction's on, I'm pro-drama
Catch me in the wildest beefs, I bring bombers
Bearded like Talibans, booted, my black ninjas
'll come through, tuxedos on with the gold llamas
Priceless like emeralds, check out the ski mask
King Tut's nephew gave it to me for three bags
Of heron, Don Baron, sniff a bag of blow
Fifth out, runnin' up in Saks with the ill army
Shake feds, play dead, yo check out what Rae said
Lay on ya hands, let the Branson break bread
High energy, all my niggas a kin to me
Regardless how it go down I still get ten a ki
Beware of my enemies, y'all remember me
Nikes with the low goose on and I've been a beast
Wilding in my headphones, red in my stones
Good ganja out, if I die fill up my headstones
With water, dough, acid and gold classics
All my niggas who pump, the spirit'll jump out and grab shit
Max with the laser on 'em, staircase caskets (caskets)
Broke bugged thugs in the hallway maxing (maxing)

 + (movie sample)
Still them 1-6-Ooh niggas, straight up (whoa, hold up, hold up)


The nozzle aim rip through ya frame for pocket change
Fiend for the Rush Hour 4 then pop a vein
Thousand dollar corks pop, pause or get off top
Used to be a general, just lost your spot
Animal House, two grand'll handle ya mouth
Beast mode with the G-Code cancel 'em out
Son, I've seen Hell, fell into the palms of Satan arms
Don that I am made 'em bow in the face of God
Graveyard Shifting, different day, the same thing
The name ring then the chain swing and dames cling
Money green, Maury kicks, whips and new fitteds
(It was all a dream) Advocated by the few who do live it
Bloomberg make a nigga cop the Mausberg
Shorty ain't a shorty, he a shooter like Wahlberg
Old man told me, "Don't be blind to deception
Only strive for perfection homey, ya mind is a weapon"


Relax, you got ya muscles tight, relax
Word... Word...

 + (U-God)
First we told y'all niggas, then we showed y'all niggas, huh?
(We gon' take it back with this)
By the time you get a show, we've been all around the globe, huh?
(We gon' take it back with this)
Before you even had a name, you was screaming "Wu-Tang"
(We gon' take it back with this)
When we was running on the block, you was under ya pops, remember
(We gon' take it back with this... let's go)


Armor truck money, Shazam bangles, play the throne like
Julius Caesar, gorilla mob, slash, Killah's gaurd
Fake passports and visas, all of my goons
They be carrying spoons because boom he had a massive seizure
Hot chocolate lovers, guns is published
Detroit bitches out of town be dying to fuck us
This is real talk, shank lullabyes
Ben Franks, we like Jet Blue we stay hella high
Curl on the dumbell L, we can't even S-P-E-L-L
MTV or TRL's
Supreme novelists, we rank superior, guarding the post
Down low in the 'jects, got it locked in ya area
Ain't tryna hurry up
We like rebel niggas powdered up wilding in the streets of Liberia
No matter the crime, I'm beating the case
If I'm a wrong, a chair hit a judge right in his face
Shitting shanks out, come to court dates
Mittens on shines with blood Wally's that's the color of wine


Talk to me, my criminal mystique
Kick back the boards, six thousand a week
Pay homage, what the don beat, you're a minor threat
I see ya sweat roll down ya cheek
And ya soft and sweet, ya talk is pork
Get murdered in New York when I enforce the heat
And the cost ain't cheap, my advice is priceless
Bring back the life that ya thought was lifeless
The way of the gun, son, who the nicest?
S.K., no stun gun, smooth devices
Time crisis, I played the game, low lifers
In a brawl, ripped the phones out the walls in Rikers
Vipers in the infirmary rooms with slicers
Shiesters with hate in their blood might bite ya
Fuck that bitch if yo wife don't write ya
Cancel her, buy another one just like her
Pipers in the bucket of ice taste righteous
Today's mathematics when we build in cyphers
The baby automatic kill like Air Force strikers
I'm still Asiatic when I spill the hypeness


The dark, and this place will come here
That's right!






Aiyo, tell me how you like it
Shorty, I can fill necklace with ice bricks
Big houses and jewelry and nice whips
And all you gotta do is tell me how you like, now how you like it?
(I tell you how I like it
And you ain't gotta try and buy me with nice gifts
We can probably take a ride in your Lexus, slide on the nightshift
Real real it, that's how I like it)


See, I'm the type of chick that'll call his phone
At two thirty in the morn', like I'm home alone
I gots to smoke, come over, make him think we fucking
And when he get here, nothing, I only need a Dutch
If it's mine, don't touch it, give it time, don't rush it
And I never do displays of affection in public
I'm Remy, and you can't control your liquor
Give you negative, you still ain't get the picture
I ain't a gold digger, I'm a go getta
And I got money, I ain't fucking with a broke nigga
Not even close, nigga, yeah I need that gwop
See I like convertibles, I don't need that top




I'm P.C., respect the don
Trick, I can switch a till Coupe from a MetroCard
Drive cars, no rules, where the trees is palm
Nice weather, everyday and the weed's the bomb
You don't believe, that my cream is long?
I got money to burn, but never trick for these sleezy broads
All they getting is a dick in they back
If I ever did, trick, when they leave me, they giving it back
I like late night creeps, with a late night freak
Hot sex in the car, with the case, might be
Long strokes when I pipe it, I can give you nice dick
And all you gotta do is tell me how you like it




Yo, I like 'em sassy, with a little touch of class
Take a redbone, sprinkle low a Stacey Dash
Body smooth, sorta like a baby's ass
Head game crazy, shorty almost made me crash


I like 'em 5'9, and a chocolate diva
BK chick, bring a nigga chocolate reefer
Sticky black, no garbage either
Freak in the bed, and know how to palm the heater


I like a chick that knows to respect the don
When it come to strength, no doubt, respect is on
She gon' ride, whenever the pressure's on
And Transform on your ass like a Decepticon


Stick and move with the weapon drawn
Bonnie and Clyde, we ride with our vests on
She ain't afraid to protect the God
She a snotty chick, that stay disrespecting y'all

Wall to wall.. that's my word
I own approximately.. everything you got
The verdict.. that's right


Yo...
Call me the black champion, Guess down, wanna test now
So let's grab the mack and vest, bless him if he stressed out
Amazing, blazing Purple Haze spaceships
Blazin asians in Mercedes Benz stations
Yo, moving through the tavern, guns that burn, sons that learn
Stabbin an intern, corporate book of words
Iceatollah Motorolas, gun reloaders, broads with rollers
When wet lens stole us, Lex glowers who owe us
Call up Comissionary Gordon, son go warn the Warden
That the lord is back, rolling with his sword again
Mixtape, masturbation mate rate plates ice traits
Guns with bitches jumping outta white cakes
It's on for real, indeed, Lex Leonardo
Shells that's hollow, six whipper through the 52 globe of horror
Carry the stainless steel armor
Nurture the church avenue drama, yo, African gold from Ghana
Puffin these marijuanas make Allah catch Alzheimers
Feedin bread to birds yellin fuck old timers

Game, subliminary mills, smash grills night chills
Mic skills baby pah won't be the same again

Segregate those fake poems
Separate the bullshit from the authentic
Vintage rhyme division got the globe listening
My rap scroll belittled your goals and visions
Prohibition got my whole block pissing Christians
One-fifty-one Dunn'll have you off balance walkin
Don't let your emotions get involved, talkin
To the wrong culprit, the killer be the soft spoken
So what's ya intentions, you want to glow for the moment?
Throw on your two pennies, then you bolting
I rock for the few chosen, who got their third minds open
Write a page that'll engage war and encite fights
Be on the look for the bright lights and North winds
The trumpets be the mics, the size malevolent
You don't belong in my eyesight, P's a powerful soldier
Other life and things won't be the same again
It's over!


It's called game, I'll get ya life killed, game recognize

So many slugs flying, thugs come in hundreds
All of them my niggas where the ? at

Most of them gulp Tabasco down, shoe game amazing
Cooling up in P.F. Changs wool

Hitting it, fingers smell like pussy, take a smell, start licking it
That'll be the day I got some liquor in me
Fly and a poet, anything other I can't cover
Just ask a real working mother






This is for the city of New York, I got you
They ask me why I'm ballin' so hard, I said I have to
Cause they forgot I'm official and I can rap too
Now I gotta carry this torch like the statue
I'ma bring it back to when rappin' was factual
And if you was a rat, then it was a wrap what they catch you
Niggas didn't add you, they get at you
When loyalty was more than your tatoo
Y'all remember that too, just watch
I'ma bring it 
Lick one shot for Trayvon and 
To all the mom's who lost they kid's, I'm sorry
Watch Eric Garner get choked, that shit scarred me

Walk up in the spot like we own it
That's how we on it

What's good nigga? Real do real
All day homie, got you, what up?

 + (Coniyac)
That's my word! I don't fuck with snake niggas
That's my word! I don't fuck with fake bitches
That's my word! My whole circle hate snitches
That's my word! We hit the block, gang riches
(That's my word, I don't fuck with snake niggas)
(That's my word, I don't fuck with fake bitches)
(That's my word, my whole circle hate snitches)
(That's my word, we hit the block and gang riches)


Bitch, fuck 'em!
Tell 'em, never, naw
I got the Chef in this bitch, go!


Aiyyo, I'm like the modern day Malcolm X heads, Gillettes and a Mac
Chrome jammy villain rollin bones with the family, hear me?
Hydro lit, Air Wick, bag of dope with the Schick
Plastic baggies with the gun on my dick
You know I play the benches and dip
Catch me in the trenches of brick, 17-9, my ninjas'll lick
Play games, lame names'll get shot up on planes
I swear to e'rything I might smear you in flames
Try to play this, spray this
My sons come through in the Angus steak Ranges, or ropin a plain bitch
Shoot 'em shorty, light 'em, roll up on 'em and bite 'em
Get your metals next week, if successful you eat
No playin fame low-key, you O.G. you the same
Lex Diamond 'matic rap y'all, pure as cocaine
We stay the real, literal, I'm only visually ill
If you relate, love to hate and don't be fuckin up mil's




Tell 'em
We ain't fuckin with none of you fake-ass niggas
Hate you fake bitches


That's my word, you know we ain't, goin out lame
Got them big toys out tonight, we showin out mayne
Used to shank like a surgeon, remove your frame
It's Edi and Crooked, with the Chef we ain't playin
The money keep growin, along with the reputation
This Outlaw shit, gon' live forever, just be patient
Banned from TV, but the streets still waitin
We stand like true G's, while the sucker niggas flagrant
Showin they true colors on the sideline hatin
While I'm on vacation spendin this rap money amazin
How we +Link+ like +Cubans+
I went from rap to rock like Rick Rubin, I'm a muh'fuckin movement
All by my lonely, ain't no phonies around me
And if it is point 'em out, let me handle my biz (that's what it is)
Death before dishonor Your Honor, I plead guilty
If they don't feel me better muh'fuckin kill me
I'm a Outlaw!




I want all my N.Y. niggas to fuck with this West Coast nigga on this shit!

Every Eastsider's a rider ready to fight a war
Long Beach, everybody in the city by the shore
Is a giant, a tyrant, or carnivorous dinosaur
We a documentary just waitin for Michael Moore
I got niggas on the block pushin her-on from Bangkok
Get it from Thai bitches who put it where we bang cock
And they just like me, homie we aim Glocks
Pull them arms out without talkin 'bout tanktops
Just let me and my niggas rise and I'm good
View the world through the eyes of the hood
It's like I still got the umbilical cause I wouldn't cut
My underbelly ties if I could - visualize if you would (what)
A city full of Nazi ass cops tryin to jam me up
Pigface Weapon Waist, nothin over family, what
I point a pistol at your Shirley Temple
It's a +Hard Knock Life+, I'll make you +Little Orphans+ Annie/ante up!






Aiyo, Rae, aiyo, Rae, check it out, yo
Let me go in there one more time and air these niggas out
For old times sake, you know how we do, my nig'
Old times sake, just for me, man, one more time, I'm begging you
Let me just go in, and just fly on these niggas heads, man
It's what I'm talking about


It's like a body in a project hallway, who did it?
Who's the next nigga that sucked the snit-ich
That's my word, it could never be me
You see the deer head on the living room wall, like his neck fell off
That can be all sculptured and glazed with gloss
Call the shots that Bill Belichick would call
Snake niggas slither all in the glass house, racial slurs
When it's time to go to war, they cash out
Throw 'em in the rear-naked choke, they tap out
Niggas try to surround the kid, I backed out
And threw two rocks at 'em, watching the ho drop
I'm from a place where we locking the low Glocks
Yellowtape, the bodies, jiggy and road blocks
Got the towels up in the air, it's so hot
Talking bout Staten Island, profiling
Switchblade city, the goons is wilding
Escape from my slums, nigga, you got talent
And we don't want the fifth of 'yac, we want the gallon


Yeah, keep holding the Hill, nigga
Everything's real, let's grow in the field, nigga
Big bread or making that lead pop
Too many ways to get hurt or get hit with a headshot


Aiyo, Yankee blue robins on, hand full of Winston's
Plump spiker with the ices on
Glad to eat too, Yves Saint Laurent's is see through
Blueish five seven, black rag, a street dude
Liquor crack kept 'em fiending, jumped off the roof two-times
I'm surprised he seen me, your bags is the truth, my G
Jumped in the white Turismo, this is fruit for me
And now the baseheads love my style, I'm like a new pipe
With airholes in it, they suggested now
You the new king, new don, new thing, only thing missing
Is the Qu'ran, a new arm, a new lean
Yeah, salute the prophet, trooper with a plot, kid
Every block, tear hood, lock it
Yeah, all my ride for me, this what I got from it
You holding steel, yup, pop for me






Yeah, major players of the game, still swinging
I'm up to bat again, ya'll already know
Barry Bonds flow, out of the park with it (Mental Instruments)
Let's go


You run through the competition, they treat you like a champ
When you winning and you make it to the big game
Dive in a pile of riches, fly bitches
Chain fridged when you, make it to the big game
Get money, big money, big fame
Spot packed out, and the fans entertained
They like me, we go hard when we play
And that's how the fuck you get to make it to the big game


Early on the paper route, blood on my hands
Cannons and lasers out, cool as a fan standing in Satan's house
Show 'em what my name about, boss of myself
Turning your lady out, talk is cheap, shut up, pay me now
Hands on the dice work, stopping your bank
Shorty you're light work, Comic View rap making my side hurt
Talent's in the mic worse, drama to rank
Feels like my life cursed, down to go out, what's the price worth
Seats leaning with the rod held tight
In the BMW g'ing with the Roswell lights
I spit gemstars, splitting your dome and I double up
Everything, heavy swing, bringing 'em home
So I'm sitting like a king on the throne, like I used to be
The right hand, now I got a thing on my own
Showing love for all my ringers home, quoting my name
You niggas been a clone, homey can't swing in my zone




Revolvers with the lazy eye, late for my plate frame
You crazy fly, screw the tip off, jump in the baby I
More papers, law makers, all of us jaw breakers is on
Vaticans in action in all ages
All my teams armored, from all the way to bulletproof socks
Hit me in the calf, it's no option
I won't fold, destined to make bail
Call up my Norfolk niggas, tip that bill, we can't play jail
No time for RICOs, kids ego
Fucked up the game, that's like sticking your eye next to the peephole
The next generation of dumb niggas, we built the legacy
These bum niggas, got invaded by slum niggas
All mine battling, we gonna battle for mansions
Branson and more bottles of Gallo
A villain slash genetleman, blowing with nine thousand Indians
I'm the Chief, this the millennium




After all that I been through, critiquing all that the kid do
The moral though, I'mma continue
We hungry, son, you ain't seen gully
You Wesley at the Carter, New Jack City, you G-Money
I beast money, feet stay fresh off the runway
Hotter than a summer day sunray, I must say
Truth like a Bible page, twenty flow said night or day
Twenty warheads at you right away
Play maker A-gamer'll sell the house out, silence the nay sayer
Throw a shout out, to all my major players
Deck take it out the park, Barry Bonds stance
They wonder, damn is his performance enhanced?
Rumble in the jungle, blind to the pressure
See, son's cool, million to one odds, he come through
I leave your trunk blue, holding your head, stuck off the one-two
Turn up the game, I just begun to




Live and direct, Staten Island 10304
USA, all the way to muthafucking Africa
Back to Pinkin Avenue




Still shining, keeping my toes close
Catch me on the quieter, flip something up bring your llama close
So y'all already know I have a gun team
They don't hang, phones calls one ring, dumping flames
The XKR, flyer performance
Built like gangstas hide ya bum monkey ass like warrants
Reflections is ill, my mansion out in lake shore raw
Two Mexicans two ??, a dog
Everybody angry, the benzes is meaner
Bitches is happy, casinos look cleaner
The word is chef is rocking tuxes now
His main trooper, the Haitian nigga buck this clown down
Operation money, let's mail this
Paper stepped up now his gun game is real bitch
Don't make me kill your man's other man
This ?? real handsome man said


She get him for the ransom, money in the mansion
Always stay coordinated, my shit's longer waited
Cease, I make it bubble up like it's carbonated
Double up right on the spot, you know I gotta make it
Map out all of the plots, I keep it formulated
It's still real here, I never feel fear
Make moves I wouldn't sit still in a wheelchair
Affirmed young general, street life I'm walking with stripes
I'm in the hood where they pop on site
Running through woods with wolves, only all of them bite
On reserves under the moon or under the sun
Either way, false moves put you under the gun
We ain't playing yo, revolvers is spun, we as hard as they come
Fresh out the ghetto, we the marvelous ones
Move 'em out, less talk, put the tool in his mouth
Combination to the safe, get the jewels and we out


Nigga all black wardrobe, the gat attack foes
Sajak with the flow, I turn letters to dough
Play the hood close, ten coke jars of good smoke
Hoodrats, car jackers, project kids cold
Slicker than Crisco, my bite like a pitbull
I spot 'em and pop 'em, his nickname pimples
Check what I'm into, melodies that rip you
Snub nose, turn these rottweilers into shih-tzus
Y'all life is skimmed through, mine is like a book you must get into
Every line come like a missile
I got issues, all I do is make her whistle
Let the goons figure out if your diamonds official
Let you... bullets tear your bone gristle, lung tissue
Gun in every hole of your body dog, I can't miss you
Chef Reas' and Ceaz', three to your temple
And y'all was never hot, not even near a sizzle



 

:
Theyll never stop listening to me (yo, whutup nigga)
They cant tune me out (whutup nigga)
Theyre drawn to me (yeah you gotta turn that shit up nigga)
Drawn like moths to a flame (this shit is serious, Keep it always official man
Add on comfortably and shit) I say the things they wish they could say
(make sure everything is real for real)
These ineffective jackals, stay up all night long to hear me speak their minds!
They cant tune me out, they cant tune me out!
Theyll always be there (this serious nigga, official shit!!)


This one bloody too, I told em this one bloody too
This bloody too, this ones bloody too
Tell em this one bloody too, this one bloody too
This one bloody too, Bronzeman 2
This one bloody too, Bronzeman 2


Your aspirations are exaggerated
Your lack of patience is written all over your face, thats why you cant make it
Listen with your mind, explore with your spirit
If you cant stop time, you gotta purchase more minutes
Reliable power rap recycles steam like nuclear tower stacks
I could rhyme for an hour on a track
Intoxicated, making obnoxious statements
About top rated emcees who somehow got jaded
The revolution is not an event, its a process
Passed down from Griff to Canibus to the Bronzeman (Nazareth)
Canibus, me and the tribal chief riding
And after you do the knowledge you can sit right beside us
Its not about money, its about interdisciplinary studies
Thats why sometimes things get ugly
Dressing all bummy, fingernails black like Ive been hunting
I brought food home for all my little munchkins
Cough it all up like a pumpkin, subwoofer bumping
Cars ride by with the booming systems
What man? Your sense of humour sucks Dad, Hip Hop should give up, man
Cos rapper can out-rap the Canibus man
And the whole planet knows it, catalog expands from the land to the ocean
Billy Ocean in the passenger seat smoking
Heartbroken cause his hero hosted a show but nobody noticed
Im having difficulty describing how I wrote it
Open mic but not one open mind in sight
So Ima fall back and pass Nazareth the mic


Yeah yo, Im like the Unabomber
Consuming a novel by the Dalai Llama
Artists pray I stay
Underground like a departed miner
Skated Satans fire, my marrow is ganja
There goes the dope supplier
Sound of the opiate audio fire
Carved outta the hottest sonatas
Ima, fujiyama mind sauna, oblongata on the pine lager
Want a yacht too, birds eye view straight out the parlor
Count the commas in my bank account
Chasin nirvana
Tasting long burn white Owls, my tails like iguanas
Pet Llamas should I let em out, and chalk trace an artist
PARDON
Im shouting MORE RELISH!!!
Im straight off the Terrace
Route a shell non terrapin style to the sheriff
My brides hair glow in the wind, eyes glarin
I brutalize air when, I turn em to urn wearing
Burnin ferns off camera
With golden goat strandsa, potent stanzas
I reign(rain) hail(hale) snow avalanches
I got big plans, semi with hemi rig plans
For enough land to grow and expand my own sess plants
My hands shine like diamond lakes and gold lamps
High chance of hailstorms, black or bright sundance
Still advance my pawn, til you layin by seaside
My family throw bullets like archie, peyton, and eli
Im a zebra mixed with edema, hiroshima and street lights
Dining at bee hives, Im a knight in shining levis
Skin sound like knives chippin at thick glass
Sniffin tear gas
Rollin mack truck rellos in class
The teacher looked at me, said if I pass, I pass
Splash tangerine spark drafts
On black casket maps
Run laps around murder scenes and never leave tracks


Ayo murder with a flask
Toast and kill em with the draft
Nervous villain laugh
Fittin in body cast for class
Sittin on a throne of glass
Spinnin microphones to ash
My cyclones is brass
When I spit em its closed caaaaaaaas-ket
Plates shift new face lift
Bronzeman 2 can you taste it?


Thats swingin swords nigga
Its back to that sword shit
Special techniques, special effects
Yall know what time it is for real
Word Up




Yeah, yeah
I see everything
I see everything
YouknowhatI'msayin?
It's like when we come through
You better have your fuckin third eye open
You know, cause thats what time it is
YouknowhatI'msayin?
Cause it's like, when you walk
You striving for perfection
That's what we doing
Understand?
So all that little fake shit out there
We know the science on that
We done seen that shit from, from
From difference of angles
YouknowhatImean?
It's like, yo kid, for real
Wu-Tang, we set off a lot of shit in this shit kid
YouknowhatImean?
But you know, you know us
We play it calm, humble
YouknowhatImean?
But I just be checking out niggas darts and I be like
Damn, them niggas, them niggas is
Really, really, really, really, really
They gonna stay shit!
Uh ha, uh ha ha
YouknowhatImean?
But it's all good cause I'm the soul controller
YouknowhatImean?
Rather I say we the soul controllers
The bottom line, like I said
Deal with freedom, justice, equality
You know?
Keep shining, add on
Food, clothing, and shelter
All my niggas, go pick up uniforms
Go, when you buy this album
Go pick up uniforms, for real
YouknowhatImean?
Cause don't think we doing this just for anybody
We doing this shit for certain niggas kid
Certain people rather, certain
Certain fans, certain supporters
Certain delegators, word
What the fuck man, I'm tired of seeing these
Fake ass niggas fucking, running with the fucking globe
Ain't even, ain't even really seeing it the
Way it, it should really be seen
YouknowhatImean?
It's like, if you going to spread mathematics
Spread it right
YouknowhatImean?




As I sit around with more blow than Bill Bixby
See the change, the two-thirteen Range; see the kick speed
Gun on my waist, movin' with base
Runnin' from Berettas; yo, my mule's name Bruschetta from the States
You wrong, she blowin' kief up in the bong
Rockin' knee-high Fendi boots, she just got bagged out in Milan
I said to my nigga, "let's kill her, we got big shit to lose"
Beside livin' like Carlos Slim, I hold the Uzi
Looked at me, "yeah?"; sinister grin, let's win
A strong British accent, yo, we jumped in the  on the tint
Highway's hot; we loaded, heavy bag full of hundreds
If we get stopped, kid for real, yo, we murder by numbers
Tastin' cheeba, sippin' tea in a coupe

Lay you under cars; eat your fruit
Will more stripes than Adidas set
 watchin', baguettes; black hard-bottoms, my ho in some sweats
The wrong way's the long way home way; tell me 'bout it
We don't do jails, cause if we get rocked, my niggas got me
Smooth sails; eatin' steaks, bringin' frozen lobsters in
Control the space; we mafia, out


*scratching*
"I live and die by the code and that's as good as it gets"
"Check-check-check-check, I'm the last of a dying breed"
"I live and die by the code and that's as good as it gets"
"Check, I'm-I'm the last-I'm the last of a dying breed"


I'm the last of this dying breed; I'm from the nineties
When boom-bap was shining and Pac was dissin' B.I.G
I'm a product of these grimy streets
I was known upon the locals, now my name is growing overseas
I sense the jealousy, my mind's forever golden
I'll redefine explosion with this microphone I'm holdin'
I'll use designer poison when they step inside this foam
And, they claim that I'm the chosen, but the industry is clonin'
Huh; so check the status, hoes, I'm hot like the equator
On some childish behavior, wasn't Tyler the creator
It's like crying in a cradle; neglected since the date of birth
Respect the turf, like we're veterans replacin' dirt
I burn tracks like in NASCAR collisions
These rap stars are pigeons with they're glass-jar incisions
I'll bring back the vision, like an act of religion
With Deck, Chef, and 'Goons, another classic to listen to
Yeah..


*scratching*
"I live and die by the code and that's as good as it gets"
"Check-check-check-check, I'm the last of a dying breed"
"I live and die by the code and that's as good as it gets"
"Check, I'm-I'm the last-I'm the last of a dying breed"


I got crazy visions, for the art
I living missile, I tear space apart, spittin'
Won't miss you, but this verse is showin' darts
Wu-Tang symbol is a living heart
My hand shake cold, like a Saint Bernard
We in the French Alps beaming down giant slopes for the mankind
Droppin' quotes in cement lines; I passport-stamp mines
Independent label air-miles; peepin' dudes in standby, braggin' bout hotel size
The city's mine; it's bubblin' like grease for them French fries when I shine
You snappin' pictures; my energy lives on through moans of crazy kitties
In homes of fancy credos; keep 'em fetal, overnight it
They say, "yes, sir", like I'm knighted
Hit mics ultraviolet; pick apart rogue values on auto-pilot
The words ignite, it's fire
Bite it, higher standard, Harvard
Here's some simple math, to fail or pass
You ain't a G, you a dollar less
Peace to Ugli and Chef
I'm runnin' wild like Dali, except my canvass is the rhymin' pad
Give me dap, like Johnny, put twenty-three on the tribal map


*scratching*
"I live and die by the code and that's as good as it gets"
"Check-check-check-check, I'm the last of a dying breed"
"I live and die by the code and that's as good as it gets"
"Check, I'm-I'm the last-I'm the last of a dying breed"






(Footsteps, door opens)
Why am I here?
Take a seat
(Sounds of chairs moving, sitting down)
We'll tell you why


This game was only built for cuban linx
That's why we strong, cause we take action and think
We're the one who runs the block, who bubbles the rock
You just a bitch, don't muscle in and try to suck on our cock
Over years we built the empire we have today
And there ain't no way your taking all the money we stacked away
It doesn't matter Rae, you know shit will turn around soon
We got enough fishscale to make that deal at around noon
Lou Diamond, Tony Starks; we got the holy spark
So powerful that it'll rip your motherfucking bones apart
You attacked us and we'll attack you back, that's a promise
We don't do threats, you will die, at least we're honest
True, we shouldn't have sent our guys on the hit job
I admit that all those heavy weapons prolly tipped off
It doesn't matter, next time we'll do it ourselves
We'll send you to hell, without being thrown in a cell


Fuck you. You think you fucking scare me?! You won't do shit, you couldn't do shit. You couldn't do shit when you sent those assholes to shoot me down in my own home! I'm more untouchable than Al Capone!! You're weak!! I could take anyone down, doesn't matter where they're from!! I.....


You running my patience thin with the strong arming of drugs
Fuck wit' me I'll pierce your arm with a slug
I got an army of thugs who will hit your car with a thud
Forty-Four magnum, no giving a head start when they bust
They wouldn't hesitate to kill you while you rest
It's why I run Philly motherfucker, I'm the best
So get all of your faggot feelings off of your chest
I don't feel shit, I conceal it all while smoking 'cess
Whatever happened to the days of Gary Cooper
He doesn't talk about his feelings, he just marches through like a trooper
I put so many motherfuckers into the ground
That even Allah is inches from sending me to the pound
I run from the days of Bulldogs, grab the bulls by the horn
Take care of problems like porn, fuck em', bury them in the corn
So I don't understand why we sitting here beating off
Why don't we just stab this motherfucker and leave some scars


Aren't you fucking rude, the ones I have beef with are over there, not over here. Whatchu got against me?
There's a reason why I don't like small little shits like you. You muscled into their territory, and came up to this meeting showing massive amounts of disrespect!! You think you wouldn't do the same to me?? I say fuck peace, shoot this stupid fuck


He has a point, what'll stop you from taking us down
The name's Don Cartagena, I'm the leader of Uptown
Moving drugs lowkey, front as a legitimate businessman
Sit and scan, you watch me as I make others kick the can
Like listen I got a house up in the hills
If I make one wrong move and I get fucked then I'm killed
So I understand his problems I just wish he'd be more reasonable
We're a season of bulls, he's just the most violent
But he's the man we call when we need the ho's silenced
Giancana is the leader, Iceberg is the pimp
And Sosa is the man who fronts all of the lint
I launder it through, and the duo do the dirty work
We all a syndicate, we take each others back if somebody's hurt
So we come from the same place as you
You just stepped on the wrong toes, don't lie, just say the truth
You muscled on in wrong, and the only one that needs to pay is you


You got me until you told me I needed to pay. I simply took some turf, made some cash. Those two sent men to follow me around and ambush me at my fucking house!! And the bulldog over there threatened to bury me in a corn field!!
You think I was the one who wanted to shake you down? No, I'm trying to tell you to calm down, admit you messed up!! Pay your dues, we can help you!! We can all be strong as one and last longer then in splinter groups fucking shooting each other on the streets!! Giancana will explain


Listen, give us a hot percentage and we can end this
Your like a tenant, we got Smith n' Wesson weapons for all the bitches dependent
You pay us or you pray to snub, you know that's how we roll
You play with us and make it up? Then you'll roll in dough
Wake the fuck up like Folgers bro, I got all of my soldiers
We're big cats, you small time; we at an all time prime
We moved from nickel and dime crimes to hittin' the skyline
You poison, your kind slowly kills us like cyanide
It's time to try, something different
You all sound like assholes, try treating him like a co-dependent
Your flow's relentless, I like that, I should try that
Me, I have to play it smooth and blow up like a dye pack
You heard earlier, I take care of the girls on the street
I like to get the girls that like to twirl on they feet
They charismatic, they attract the best customers
You and me are alike, we both the same type of hustlers


I'm small time huh? Obviously your wrong, otherwise you would've killed me and be done with it, not invite me to this circle jerk. As for your friend here, he seems like a nice dude. Why don't you follow him for a change
Because I'm the boss and he needs to shut the fuck up when grown folks is talking, as do you child
The fuck you say to me??!
You heard me nigga
(Loud noises of arguing, gunshots fired in the air)

(Noises go down)



Listen, they just want you to pay the restitution
It's the best resolution, we the best set to crew with
We see potential but the other brothers hate competition
You attacked first, understandably they don't want to stop and listen
But Cartagena and Iceberg can show the ropes
Me? I don't give a fuck, but peace is what I hope to sew
So basically, pay up and these guys will protect you
You have no choice, so take it, we'll drop our guns and accept you
I don't give a motherfuck, I'm not a deck you can fold
I don't care bout my death, I'm taking steps so you know
I crept down the hole, I don't like what I see
Pay money? Nah I'mma fight to the T
I was told this commission was a crime novel obelisk
I'm not afraid, I'm not shaking from the brains to the temple
You guys are obvious, maybe I should not exist
This is extortion, way too plain and simple


I say to all of you that I have been treated this day with no respect! I've made you all money. And I asked for little. Good. You won't give, I'll take! As for the Dons, they have made it very clear today that they are my enemies! You must choose between us




Ayo, Ayo, I run with real niggas who kill niggas
Whose dreed is longer then niggas and pot is filled
(Cottons are peeled yo) Bank holders forming a shank holder
Driving costly shit, Speak in slang, Leaning like hangovers
The glide'n, We vibe'n, We take you to the Brownsville
Drive to the West side to S.I. so dress fly
True valence, Living my talents, I learned to cook clean
And swing and bling yo, And murder for thousands, Yep
A rap pharaoh who arrow got poison in it, (Boys get it who stunt)
You know I'm General like Colin Powell
Meet the new team on the street, Formulated by long waited
A strong operation for more, Come like Sampson
Kill like a thousand off one bone
And walk up on my mansion dipped, Flip the mobile phone
Flip niggas, I promise we hit big timers
Bury some men, Niggas say it's cold when I switch climates
(Ayo, It's real rap need ya nigga, Go in)
I told men it's only one nigga that's left, He rock a gold M
Mercy ya lago egg, His leg flooded
Mold made out of lead, So when the snare kick




Wu-Tang... yeah (what up son) you know
It's back to that good ol' thing again, you know?
(Pass that, pass that, man) Word up, we do this tremendously
(It's on, Rae) word up from staircase to stage
Yeah... (yo who that?) You know what it is
(Oh shit... that's the Wu niggas man) aiyo


From out the air space, I'm rockin' leather pants in the tenth grade
My pen blaze, now we in the wind gate, killin' haze
Put this shit back in order, do it like the crack days
Stack up, you little niggas back up, your raps suck
I demolish a maggot, faggot lines, nigga, you'se a savage
But don't never compare me to your wack times
I'll smash your hood up, yeah, anybody you call
I straight mash out, for cash nigga, put up
The Embassy's calling, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
Enemies is falling, y'all niggas ain't good enough
Now acknowledge the strength, we stand like buildings
In the city, raise that rent up, y'all niggas gonna give me, baby
Yeah, what, fucker, we stomp niggas out like XUV's
Then fuck ya girl in the but-ut
Nine rap playboys, see me in the Playboy Mansion
With the playboys on, I play rid-ough


Nigga, we glide when we ride, don't choke when we smoke
Disrespect fam, yo ass gon' get smoked
We got real money, seven figure deal money
I'm in the Samuel Jackson, Time to Kill money


Yeah, we got them anthems, we handsome and raw
All day, cops harass, but we laugh at the law
And a fiend got my stash, I blast through your door
I caught her with the four, his dame was frozen
She loves sniffing coke til her veins is bulging
You punk motherfucker, your ribs is frail
I've been eating calamari, getting big in jail


Nigga, we glide when we ride, don't choke when we smoke


I got that sidedish super today, eye candy
With the sweetest love, one bite, your tooth'll decay
I'm moving units like I'm moving the yae, and like they say
In this business, you either in it, bitch, or you in the way
Sky's the limit, I ain't come here to play, or come to shit where I lay
Who in that six blunt, clipping his tray
Sippin' some Ice Water, dipping with Rae
Tipping these tricks, dripping for pay
And knowing half them bitches is gay
T.M.I. blowing tree in sky, we on the job
So be abvised, that wack niggas, needing apply
S.I., represent til we die, this track is pitching to fry
Enter the Dragon, I be spitting that fire
Keep ya balls off, so calling you dogs off
Cuz word to these jeans, hanging off of my ass, I never fall off
The sensei, with this pen I slay
Pick up a queen in Miami, then get M.I.A., John Blaze, bitch

All my cats, international, worldwide
Niggas know how it get down
This the O.C.N., body prover, stick and mover
Get more gangsta, Patti Labelle'd out wigs
D.J. Ace the original crowd motivator
The Good: (Bambue), The Bad: (Raekwon), The Thugly: (Scarface)
Wit fine sexy ass Allure on the hook, nigga
Full Force on the hook, nigga, Lou Star on the hook, cat
Pitch Black, the track, yo, Full Force is back, let's go
(This one is dedicated, to all the haters, the non believers
Those who counted us out the game, no, we all here, yo
Those bullshit executives, who don't know a damn thing
This is for the people, Full Force, yeah)


You've done up and done it now, real niggas stand up, testify
(We are here to show that Full Force, ain't none to fuck wit)
Ya'll play fool, but don't forget, Full Force, now jumpstart this shit
(We are here to show that Full Force, ain't none to fuck wit)


Aiyo, take money and chill, the most illest out of reels
Jump out of wheels, prada slip-ons, a lot of bills
You connin' it, this don, the streets honor it
Lean back and green garnaments, clean ornaments
Post in your arial, what, what, what, smoke in your area
Son, gun up provoke in your area
Swim through mammal style, do you, I do it great flannel style
A lot of ammo when a lot of owls
Run wit B.K. reppers, blow, swifter and sweeter than a neck
To dress my ass off, wreck somethin', blow monster hits
Wit dominance, it ain't real, and no honor this, might get you a honor spliff
Catch me in shoes and jeans, B.M. wagon
Lightin' up green, typin' up a letter by all means
Full Force come wit it, makin' this all real
I'm done wit, snatch paper kid, run wit it




Aiyo, hold up, stop, my niggas had this shit locked
Since the pop wilds, some that got
And show and tell time, he speaks, they can't sleep
Recognize what's goin' down, and bang this up in the streets
Some died, some dried out, had you cried out twice
I say I roll wit Full Force, you lookin' at me like
The fuck, you better get wit it ya'll
Not too many niggas got diamond plaques up on the wall
And it's fact, will never fall, on hits I flip sick
Blowin' up another chick wit big tits
Money talk, bullshit walk, know the rhyme
Give me beats that throw hook, like no hook, I punchlines
Roll wit Full Force, cuz I won't settle for less
Of course I'm on this joint, cuz I gotta have the best
Come through wit big niggas, me and my dough deliver
Bambue, boom, who's the flex spitter?




If you done heard one ghetto story, you heard 'em all
Seem like every rapper rhymin' bout they turnin' ball
That's why I got on this song, so I can let a nigga know
I ain't doin' this for the floss, baby, this for dough
Imagine if the whole rap game was ice and blunts
And in every other bird, you shot your dice and guns
Sit that trifle up, ok, try for this, like a talented man, the right to win
Strand, wacker shit sell than most tapes
Me and Force fed, bullshit, you lose grapes, like
Full Force, I remember now to speak your play
In the hard ways, on the telephone all day
So I had to come and rep it for the O.G.'s
So some mistake it for the Force M.D.'s
I move up on your sheets, so I had to come get it
I appreciate you puttin' me down, that's a privilege


Now it's our time to shine, Full Force get busy, one more time




You've done up and done it now, real niggas stand up, testify
(We are here to show that Full Force, ain't none to fuck wit)
Real niggas dance up in this mix, Full Force back up in this mix
(We are here to show that Full Force, ain't none to fuck wit)


Yeah, nigga, you know how it get down
Representin' New York City, D.J. Ace along side Full Force
We still standing for Y2K and beyond
East Coast, West Coast, we're tired of this shit, nigga, put your hands down
Along side my man Raekwon, represent the Wu
The infamous Scarface, and the girl Bambue, the grave spitter
Pop this shit in your whip, boy, all the independent women stack your paper
You know what time it is, all my niggas push it up, pop your collar
Hah-hah, come on
(We are here to show that Full Force ain't nothin' to fuck wit)




Oh yeah, coming through with my Shaolin crew
Two cent for a case, gimme St. Ide's brew
In the midst of broken bottles and crushed up cans
Methtical's in a jam, oh how dry I am
With St. Ides in my system
Crack another I'm blessed, let's go get the next one
And get over, the object is to stay sober
Lay on the sofa, better yet, dial my chauffeur
Call me the Wallabee Champ, stretched out, could never be Son
Ricochet daily hit the deli for a cold one
Naturally blessed, yes, my rap is like a laser beam
Laser beam, laser beam, laser beam...


Uh, uh, uh
Sing


So we all got children, products of the ghetto
Momma cooked the soup, daddy did the yelling
Uncle was a drunk, cousin was a felon
When he got pitched, he told them he wasn't tellin'
Auntie was a cook, her husband was a crook
Cause every job he had they be payin' him off the books
Ghetto university, knowledge is all it took
In a tenement I was listenin' to the hook
Change gon' come, the spirit of Sam Cooke
When the feds comin', everybody be shook
Now we doin' life like Eddie Murphy and Martin
On the chain gang, I was singing into the coffin


The roaches and the rats, heroin and the cracks
Couldn't blame me, I'm just giving the facts
I'm tryna hit the top, cause' bottom ain't where it's at
Everybody got a past but you can never go back


Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Sing)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Sing)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Sing)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Sing)


Tellin' you like it is, how we ever gon' live?
If we ain't gettin' money, how we feedin' the kids?
It's a revolving door, where brothers be doin' bids
I know it sound wrong but the door will be what it is
Survival of the fittest, this poor girl the illest
Broke parents and black cats give me heebie-geebies
Life seems hard but nothin' ever comes easy
Whatever's in the dark, can always become the light
If you ain't in a battle, how you gon' win the fight?
I gotta speak the truth when I'm up in the booth
The streets be flyin' birds but they don't be on the roof
Poverty is a pain like you pullin' a tooth
Told the streets don't let me go like I'm Bishop in Juice


Roaches and the rats, heroin and the cracks
Couldn't blame me, I'm just giving the facts
Tryna hit the top, the bottom ain't where it's at
Everybody got a past but you can never go back


Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)

And they sing New York City
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah




And now, ladies and gentlemen: Mr. Clay will honor us with a recitation of his classic poem "I am the Greatest"
*Bell Rings* I AM THE GREATEST!


Bro I woke up this morning I looked in the mirror and you know what I said to myself? I said "You have to be great. The greatest."


I'm smoked out all day
You know it's kush you can smell it in the hallway
Ten bad bitches, you can all stay
God bless, let us all pray
New deal, new money
I spend it like I never really knew money
Can't stop gotta get the crew money
Won't stop till I got that fuck you money
I'm prime time, HD
Cool nigga, AC
Slated and you haters can't replace me
Fuck around and make me ease off safety
Hush up, I said hush up
All you sideline niggas shut the fuck up
Big ballsack put your nuts up
It's Era in this bitch, nigga what's up


It's the greatest, your favorite rapper's favorite
H2O, JD Era blaze shit
Turn it up, get wasted, let's face it
No other crew could ever try to break this
It's the greatest, your favorite rapper's favorite
H2O, JD Era blaze shit
Turn it up, get wasted, let's face it
No other crew could ever try to break this
The greatest (The greatest)
The greatest (The greatest)
The greatest (The greatest)
The greatest (The greatest)


I want it all, crumbs too
This the Art of War nigga, Sun Tzu
Bitches want to kick it like kung fu
So if she 21 I hit her with the one two
Twenty-twenty vision, game good
Ask around the city boy my name good
New era, flame good
They knew Era like we grew up in the same hood
Late night, grey ship
Hustle like I get it on the pavement
My momma told me "Baby don't take shit"
And scared money ain't never gonna make shit
So I muscle up, double up
I send you on this trip don't fuck it up
Greatness, tell them suck it up
Beginning of the end, boy your luck is up





* Dhani Harrison & John Frusciante play guitars


Shh, shh, shh, shh, Wu, Wu, Tang, Tang


The joy the flowers bring me
The pain still has me sinking
All while my heart gently weeps
Your smile has got me shrinking
The tears in your eyes are twinkling
Because the heart gently weeps


Snowy night, fiends basin', A Raisin in the Sun was amazing
The joint on the dresser, a gauge went off
Jumped up, fish tank, it fell, and they stuck
They shot her cousin LaVon, he owed a buck
Willie was awful, pulled out the ratchet, let off two
Grits fell on his leg, Kiana ripped the cold bowl
He violent, an Island nigga with the talent
Of six killas who just came home, from straight whylin
Robbin everything in Macy's, Lacy, short haircut
With long arms who fuck niggas, got four babies
Yvette jabbed her, slapped her wig off, ran in the crib
She did the dumb shit, my nigga then clapped her
Lester, smoked Chester sister Vest, I heard it was a mess
They ripped the apple out her throat, blessed her
Hungry hyenas from Medina, all "A-trainers"
Who got reluct', think fast and blast from Beamers


Yeah, yo
I brought my bitch out to Pathmark, she's pushin the cart
Headed to aisle four, damn I got milk on my Clark's
That's what I get, not focusin from hittin that bark
My mouth dried, need plenty water quick, I feel like a shark
In the aisle bustin them paper towels and wipin my Wally's down
I stood up to face a barrel, he's holdin a shiny pound
It's him, he want revenge, I murdered his Uncle Tim
I sold him a bag of dope, his wife came and copped again
{*singing*} That bitch is crazyyyyy
And uh, she brought her babyyyyy
She knew I had the murderous smack
It killed her man though
Now I got his fuckin' nephew grippin' his gat
You's a bitch - {*singing*} you better kill meeeee
You know you're bootyyyyyy
You pulled your toolie, out on meeeee... motherfucker
First thought was to snatch the ratchet
Said fuck it and fuckin grabbed it
I ducked, he bucked twice, this nigga was fuckin laughin
I wrestled him to the ground, tustle, scuffle, constantly kicked him
He wouldn't let go the joint, so I fuckin bit him
Shots was whizzin, hittin Clorox bottles
Customers screamin, then the faggot ran out of hollows
I had to show him what it's all about
Next thing you read in the paper, "A man who came to kill gets knocked out"


I don't know whyyy-hy-hyyyy, nobody told you
Man's not supposed to cry...
Though we're just babies, and it's so crazy
How tears of joy bring so much life


Yo, ayo, yo, yo
You on your way to the store nigga grab me a Dutch
I'm mad as fuck, my dude
My count was short when I was baggin it up
Now I need liquor, nigga pass me a cup
What's up with Officer Brown?
The other day he tried to shackle me up
He killed Kase and now he hasslin us
This motherfucker got balls
Even the gall to try and pattin me up
Time to re-up, let these niggas know we back on the block
With three hundred off a G-pack, crack in the spot


I don't know whyyy-hy-hyyyy, nobody told you
Man's not supposed to cry...
Though we're just babies, and it's so crazy
How tears of joy bring so much life


The joy the flowers bring me
The pain still has me sinking
All while my heart gently weeps
Your smile has got me shrinking
The tears in your eyes are twinkling
Because the heart gently weeps





* Best Buy bonus track


Yeah, yeah
It's a No I.D., Legendary Traxster production
Twista


I'm a giant, into astrological science
Rapper phenomenal violence, I'm such a honorable tyrant
Verbal telekinesis is cutting fellas to pieces
Hell of a thesis, but holy, like you could tell it's from Jesus
As good as Pelican Brief is, with the force of a sorcerer
Never put fork in the pork, I'm orchestrating the orchestra
Forfeit your formula, cuz I'm forming a
Thesaurus of verses, or it's a chorus of more when I smoke a forest
Super powers like Morpheus, foresee us like the Oracle
Portable MP3 players let you play what's recordable
Legendary like Traxster, not scared to bury you rapper
I'm up for the beef, you just a vegetarian actor
Identification is gon' have to go by me
Cuz long as I got No I.D., victims ain't got no I.V
Intravenous sleep poetry, Pedialyte
I'mma give 'em, they said it was hot, so check the media hype


As long as people wait, oh, there's no escape
The heat... the heat... the heat... the heat...


I recollect the era where terror and recommendations are wrecking
The mic respecting Mecca with no hesitation
Meditation in line of giving my praises to Allah
Thoughts are taken Shahada, and throwing rocks at the Kaaba
These days is bout the dollar, all of them into balling
The Sound Scan and the cannons, you ask if it's all appalling
All the ragging, the sagging, the swagging, the selling drugs
And the thug in the tight pants, what happened to yes y'alling
Sometimes I can't help the violence when I kick random rhymes
Make you shut the fuck up like silencers or pantomimes
Write an autograph for you as if you a fan of mine
Cuz I got you tripping off of the way my grammar rhyme
Fixational, my dictation is evident, I'm benevolent
Cuz the flow is elegant, throw like an elephant
They should have told him that I flow like petroleum
And I've been cold at the podium, since break dancing on linoleum




Cooling with the hustlers, eating rum fish, guns is crisp
Can't stand fake niggas and fake bitches
Don't make me upset my stomach, them killas'll come through
The bathroom and tie up your honey
I'm all about my coins, the fly Donald Goines of rap
Fuck with fly chicken tenderloins
You know it, you blow it, you know you gotta go
You can't live it, word to the mama, that's a no
Surrounded by dons and consiglieres, don't get leary
Refrigerator might fall, don't worry
You a good naked, stay in that zone
You speaking to a rich real rap nigga, cooling on his throne
Yeah, kiss your forehead with lead
I got some Chicago niggas that do it quick fast with some bread
And my lawyer, an African prince
Slid to America with three bags of dope, a black Benz






Straight up nigga, I'm a money nigga man
You know what time it is wit me, yo
That's right
Take the track, cut the heads off, split it down the middle man
Take the bones out man for real
Yeah all applepie yeah
Straight up, Flipmode BK king


It was the best heist since ice
Precise rituals
Skated outta Jacob's wit the Fruit Loop jewels
Holdin a navy blue uzi
Krush Groovin waves off the atlas
Coolin, that's how we make movies
Basketball gun brawlers, bounce
Black down 'bill-a-head banks, Malibu colorful shanks
That's the way we live, Staten Island kid
O-Doggin' it, the thug vaccine wit no pork in it
Vivid imagination paper chasin
Dufflebag swollen, we holdin
Drink chocolate milk before we roll in
It's like that ya'll, we gangstas
Stickin all you Bay Ridge Benzes
I'm out to get erect, terrific shit be the diamond district
Tiffany's, pretty Valentine brick is on the second floor balcony
Gems is magnificent, diamonds is cryin
"Busta Rhymes take me, nevermind them!"


Aiyyo caught em at the ice pavilion
Dressy, salad bar style Nestle
Four white niggas, covered in vest pieces
Think like a mob flick
Guessin like Patsy in the mask, piece bust
Got aggravated, slapped the glass piece
One nigga beamin, faggot ass
Lay on the floor ya fuck!
Tied his broken arm to his Hush Puppies
Wrapped around trauma, everything realer than fuck
Tajuana left my nigga niece live comma
Three young Italians, suited down personal style
I'm in valour white designin on the 'dallions
Felt like some crackers was in back of me
Spit on the clerk, pass the Harry Winston set
Ghost backin me
Bust a shot, motored
Four mill in paper work Lord
We get together once more before we blow this
Murdered nobody
Left em all baseball'd down, brotha
Three wicked ass 6's, Gucci colors


MONEY! Drop dead on the floor
Nigga, pass the keys to the door
Pass me all the cash in the drawer
Or I promise you'll be payin the price
Feelin like a nigga died twice

Ya'll niggas know we out to get this MONEY!
C'mon MONEY! 7x
Raekwon, Ghostface, Rocky Marce C'MON!
Let's get this money nigga

The Feds is after us, vest on my back
Whippin the Acuras, feel like a mac bustin
A rug in Preston on percussion
I'll bust in your gate, nigga it's nothin
A hail storm, ice rainin, mind containin
Info, nigga what you in for? Complainin
Sick bars deep in this language
Did I tell you how my day's spent?
Speakin through the face of Ronald Regan
Iceberg History, calligraphy
Colidescope colors, hollow-head shells and flarin gunmen
Hate to see me comin like gray skies on day of judgment
Makes you wonder where the love went
Hit a nigga, feed him to some buzzards
Put up numbers, plus I'm one to push his mug in
We duck in the safe, check what I'm huggin
Rocks the size of some shit, out in the congo
My arms full, let's get the fuck out, Busta I got you


Aiyyo we do great study on fossils and stones like archeologists
Gem-ologists, collect the most priceless ices anonymous
Canary stones yellow like a pumpkin
Dunkin Donut precious size stones make me wanna cut the safe open
Rae pass the blowtorch, Ghost brought the dynamite stick
Marciano brought a chisel wit an ice pick
Princess cuts, invisible settings
Plannin the world's greatest diamond heist playin a tune by Otis Redding
Icicle cones hang from the ceiling just like stalagmites
Time to throw on a skully and tie a rag tight
Throwin light went off and in the basket
Grabbed the necklace from off the satin pillow while the glass casket
Ice lay across the crushed burgandy velvet
Up in the diamond slide-tray
Gun in your face, slide it right away
Roundtable with Habib, Mirishnokof, and the rest of them Jewish niggas
We got them niggas drunk and talkin foolish see
You know the way we straight manipulated the shit
We swindle them niggas for all their precious things before we skated and shit
Yeah, ya'll niggas know we skated early
Disguised ourselves as Hasidic Jews and even left my sideburns curly
Bounce to Mexico and spend some pesos
And bury the diamonds on an island your never heard
Like Turks and Caicos
Everytime we hit, we in and out quick
Don't be surprised if we behind supplyin niggas all the platinum and shit

MONEY! 17x

Yeah, the world's greatest jewel heist
Thoroughly and successfully executed
By none other than Ghostface Killah, Raekwon the Chef

(Raekwon)
This Nigga just bought eleven machine guns
And he brought them in my crib

(Ghostface Killah)
Glittered out, stout face, tec, Rae up in the Hilton
Heard Nia Long is in the building
Penthouse fashion, ordered out room service
It looked bugged cause the waiter looked nervous
Lift off the lid, seen two shiny thirty-eights aimed at the kid
What I do, duck!
Rae up in the shower singing
Son don't know that it's real
Coming looking like he about peel something
In a tight jam, red down, matching like santa
If I could just reach my hammer
He bust two shots, I played mice
Ran to the spot were the sun was at, quickly he was blinded by the ice
That's when Rae ran out of the back
Towel on, soap on his arms, spit duke around, fell on my lap

(Raekwon)
Yo, what the fuck happened?

(Ghostface Killah)
It was a set up to get wet up

(Raekwon)
Starks you're bleeding

(Ghostface Killah)
Nah, his blood fucked my white leather up
Ten G's down the drain
Yo hurry up, we got to get him up
Get the sheets son, let's fix him up
Lock the door, turn the TV off, your kicks is near the light switch

(Raekwon)
Just give me two minutes to iron my shirt, find my ices

(Ghostface Killah)
The hit came quick
Hit the jack, star six
Ghost

(Raekwon and Ghostface Killah)
Put down the phone stupid
Wipe off your prints

(Ghostface Killah)
Rae ran hysterically
Slipped on soap
Landed on his back, with his gat, now that's dope
We got three minutes, nobody seen shit
Somebody might have heard shit
Singing on some Martin, were my momma bird shit
Fuck your socks, that's when we heard the door knock
Everything all right? Partying son, balloons popped
Threw this dude under the bed
A half dressed Raekwon, swallowing diamonds
Had money in juice up on his wedding day
The phone rang off, the tea kettle blew, wifey hitting me
What you want sweaty, lima beans and kidney
Trashed the beeper, slowly I reached for the reefer
Throw a Costa, peep oh son the house keeper
Soap suds dripping from his nuts, cut up gut
Praying how me make it out the telly untouched

(Chorus - Ghostface Killah)
Fuck it, a Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda
We laptop niggas, thugs in a computer
Caught up in the grimy shit
Finding two days later a murder and we got to make this flight shit
It was a Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda
We laptop niggas, thugs in a computer
A Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda
We laptop niggas, thugs in a computer

(Raekwon)
Ayo, the pressures on, sonny got murk
Its time to move fast
Ayo, Deini it's on, check out the news flash
Flew out the next day, back to the Tony estates
Blew on the first class flight to L.A
It ain't take long, I pulled a few strings on the horn
So where it came from?
That nigga we stuck and took the caine from
We should have killed him when we had him
Yo I was holding a Magnum
Yeah we bagged him, but we let him slide in the wagon
His bad little brown ho, from out Chicago
She move his cargo, good at handling Roscoe's
We had our eyes closed God, we should have seen it coming
He should have seen me coming, running out the shower gunning
Now that I figured it, she put the waiter on
It all came to me, in back of my mind, just like my favorite song
Dawned on me later on
By then the day was gone
How dare this nigga even think that he could take us on
Smoke the Cee Allah
Sent the kite through the Pens
Him and big Dan
Known to split wigs, with razor sharp gems
Giants from Attica riots
Halls is quiet
CO's with babies on their arms look tight
And this nigga from down state got shipped up north
Stocky young fella, running his lips on how he set it off
Then heard that shit, plus got that kite
Money got murdered in his bunk that night

(Chorus)




Some day, I know you'll be far away
I'll be right here to stay, give me one day
Baby, baby, don't, run away, come see me
Some day, I'll be right, here today, just give me love, Rae


To my hood, I'm always there for you
Rain, hail, sleet, snow, and I'm there
For all the underprivileged, yo we here
My life is all in your soul, daily, since nana left us
She took all of your blessings, cuz she been there
My life change, yo, could never though be without you, yo
It's strange when I want it to rain
On my best friend's grooming, we all had visions of you
We broke nights, God, knowing you cared
Peace, nigga, only for a minute and I'mma break out
Come back and kiss you on your feet, here
I love my hood, I love my niggas, there, yo
The older we get, we understand, you might tear




You keep the little young ones, happy, true
Graduations occured, you look so pretty and new
Look at the sky, all blue, all old people with you
Facilities mailing, jail brothers miss you
Wow, it gets crazy when I think about the money you made me
Slipped me away, but Jakes tried to rade me
Nighshifts, smokin' on spliffs, you kept yellin'
"Carry your fifth, the down the block niggas is gay"
They keep police invadin' your space, we can't live
Plus, they gassin' the mayor, them niggas wanna give you away
We won't have that, suburban people mad at the fact
That you be gettin' more company then them, they just be scared of that
"Hood", look at your name, spell it backwards
Yo, "Dooh", that's what they yellin' in vain
You the realest, the most livest, flyest, you part of life
I gotta give you love, cuz you gave it God and life




Who ever said you ain't do right by me, they frontin', yo
They couldn't understand that we was a team
I used to come out, hear you words, talk to me, walk with me, brother
Cool, try to be succesful and dream
The city lights is on, now, they wanna turn 'em off
Try'nna start some shit, actin' like you never made a penny for 'em
Dun, they doin' you dirty, we had Summer Youth for that, though
No need to cry, never get worried
You gon' live forever, word to mother
Cuz she raised you right, and you got fifty-one brothers
I sat with the trees and had conversations at bees
We talked about throwin' money up, landscapin' your knees
You forget that, something to talk about
Show me where to take the check, pay these suckas off and be out
The'll never be another place, everybody happy to see
That's why I keep coming back to you, peace





  Aiyyo, this a perv, yo
 Yo, son there's bitches in there?
 Yeah, yeah, the coaches, aiight then


Jump up in the party like

Bartender where the liquor at?


Aiyyo, seven thick ribs nigga, check out my man

We from the gutta niggas, chest sputta what up
Fuckin with us or get you cut up, matta fact get'cha mutha
Cause I ain't fo real fo real, don't play games and I'm ill
I'm just a business man who love getting niggas killed
Smell my satiate smell keys, that shit's like deodorant, daddy
I like maglees for other reasons
Run with niggas that love paper
We let the youngest niggas get rich and mow them like makeup
You can lex 'Zino and Benzino together
That's priceless to put our pay together, niggas by Lexus
Straight out the ghetto niggas is pussy
To even fuck with us that'll be the day a white nigga mush me
Straight up, two-thousand is mine
Heavy lines, heavy guns, big-ass Chevy's, we make niggas shine


Jump up in the party like 
Where my niggas at? 
Where my bitches at? 
Bartender where the liquor at?
Jump up in the party like 
Where my niggas at? 


Black shells, scuba style, sonar, I go deep
Rip lungs outta jaws, flawless, I don't sleep
The fast and furious, Yokohama twin jets
Black and white bagettes, I'm duckin feds
Hydro-plane, hydro-foil blow hydro
Smooth gotho, Ray, its aiight I got those
I got this, son I spotless
Frozen watches, belts wit the notches
Bitches topless, three-way manages, Motorola holder
Break bread with Motola, take advice colder 
Kedar knock-areano, Motown soldier
I thought I told ya lil' double Ray'll ghost ya
Double row, parvin, three-sixty rubber band
Ice me Apalla then three shave frozen hand
Dark shadow, my shit gleam in the shade
Watch `Zino flow, fuck the Macy's parade


Jump up in the party like 
Where my niggas at? 
Where my bitches at? 
Bartender where the liquor at?


Yo, broke far from it, coke, sold a lot of it
Flow off the meter, let me know if y'all want it
Son, the life of problems and guns, so silence her, son
Bugs Bunny Icebergs and Air Force One's
I paint a picture listen up you become part of the song
When I slow my first young a new saga begun
Unaware, I would become a nemesis for livin in this
Drug dealin life, smoked niggas and bitches with plugs
Never been a snitch, I'm not built like that
I'm real, that's why we not feelin you like that
I'm the ghetto manifested in words
When I die, niggas'll point a valuable lesson I learn
Whether OG or adolescent in the presence ashurn
OT or O-key handlin birds
Like Dominique I feel I deserve respect I earn
Mega is a word we all protect with words, holla


Jump up in the party like 
Where my niggas at? 
Where my bitches at? 
Bartender where the liquor at?




Yo what up?
Stop parking your rollers on the side of the street homey
This is fucking Chef, man
This your brother Chef, man
From Shaoland
You already know it's Shaolin, what going on?


Back for vengeance, glocked up, drinking Croc up
Call it what you call it, I'ma call it some block stuff
Used to flashing gats, double barrels that flips narrow
Don't even give it to Daryl then
Hang with the monster mobsters
All of them keep rockets on 'em, ain't no sense for the arguments
Drugs and guns and dunns in every part of my plan's done
Hiding in my mansion, one year
I'm a Polo head, Polo with a Rover sober red
Riding with my niggas in Chicago, hold the lead my nigga
'Cause it's the bigger we get, the bigger you fall
The bigger we shit, check the wall full of scholars
Bank robbers ankle gold joggers
All my niggas quick to get off, popping collars, kid
It's just a family status
Don't get sprayed up for fucking with the family cabbage


Samuriders, scramble when I aim the tote
Best believe I'ma flame your acre with metal bolts
From the flavors you taste when the rocks is quotes
I'ma have a bronze yacht soon with all onyx scopes
My hands stay clean without the soap
When you see it's us you feel the rush, the opposite of hope
Slammin' grammar winds that choke and I hammer hints of hope
Slammer winds that's cold, I deliver ki's of coke


He must be on meds and shit
I keeps one of those things that shreds your shit
Or did he forget the number of how many get hit?
For fuckin' with real niggas, more money to get
Fuck it, sandblast niggas like the Mojave
Beast Mugabi, I'll be probably oddly
Pushing down the street low key bucket and banger
Front liners with me strictly, buckin' and bangin'
Twisting the robbery on missions soldiers
Goblins know got steam brewing niggas like Folgers
Fronkenstein, I'ma bubble away
From tripling what a nigga made yesterday
Before I start bustin' a musket, ivory tusk handle on the hammer
Trust me it must be Pentagon or nothing, motherfucker
I won't tell you again
Sand rider, Samurider, I'ma ride till the end


Samuriders, scramble when I aim the tote
Best believe I'ma flame your acre with metal bolts
From the flavors you taste when the rocks is quotes
I'ma have a bronze yacht soon with all onyx scopes
My hands stay clean without the soap
When you see it's us you feel the rush, the opposite of hope
Slammin' grammar winds that choke and I hammer hints of hope
Slammer winds that's cold, I deliver ki's of coke


Women are for fucking, men are for fighting
Who cares, as long as they both bend over smiling?
Yo, I get muddy like Volkswagon off road buggy
Ladies love me, teddy bears and puppies
Poisonous insects and animals in the stash house
Looking for cash, don't put ya hand in the couch
Frodo Baggins escort the Komodo dragon
Repeat rapid, memorize the God's solo classics
Predator prowler truth to power gunpowder
Plaid lumberjack flak jackets and cowboy trousers
Ponderosa Ibuprofen, gasoline soaked Mimosas
Ocean Spray Grey Goose dolphins
Charles Bronson Godzilla Gulf of Tonkin
Sponsored by the Luxor the casino comped him
The Rat Hunters cut his dick off last summer
Flushed it down the toilet, send it back to his mother, motherfucker


Samuriders, scramble when I aim the tote
Best believe I'ma flame your acre with metal bolts
From the flavors you taste when the rocks is quotes
I'ma have a bronze yacht soon with all onyx scopes
My hands stay clean without the soap
When you see it's us you feel the rush, the opposite of hope
Slammin' grammar winds that choke and I hammer hints of hope
Slammer winds that's cold, I deliver ki's of coke


Heartless, like war torn soldiers in Bosnia
I was with his girl yesterday, ain't have to Bill Cosby her
Craig G, Can-I-Bus, Rae, Kurupt
Antiseptic on beats, you ain't low spray your guts
What? Cover it up with a Band Aid
Damn straight you'll never come close when we mandate
These verbal executions, fitting MCs necks for nooses
Catch him as he cops a few looses
I literally and figuratively shoot fifths
True shit, a way to lose quick
Is to cross me, leave a body cold in these warm streets
Hop off stage punch him in the face, hop back on beat
Hold New York, 42nd Street was for dope fiends
Triple feature kung fu flicks and other coke schemes
Orange boxcutters and and cut off his feet sleeks
It's different now, it's easy to act tough from a safe place


Samuriders, scramble when I aim the tote
Best believe I'ma flame your acre with metal bolts
From the flavors you taste when the rocks is quotes
I'ma have a bronze yacht soon with all onyx scopes
My hands stay clean without the soap
When you see it's us you feel the rush, the opposite of hope
Slammin' grammar winds that choke and I hammer hints of hope
Slammer winds that's cold, I deliver ki's of coke



Dirty as you go there was a gangster born
He controlled the island with over 4000 soldiers
He ran over 30 projects
Whatever you needed in the hood, you had to go through him
He had his hand in everything
Racketeering, money laundering, gambling, prostitution
It was all his for the taking
He had over 400 cops on the payroll
He organized a powerful elite with a cold heart and a hot hand
And those who were perpetrators were dealt in a torturous way
The neighborhood loved and feared him
He had a good heart and a fresh soul
His name is Lex Diamond and this is his story

? with the execution of my children
From that witness forward, everybody in that courtroom knew
Uh, and agreed, that the mafia existed
The mafia operated in the United States and Sicily
It had various rules and it didn't ? in this business
And that many of the people in that room were members of the mafia




This is Lex Diamond nigga the boss all them niggas
With the levers is soft afraid to ask what it cost
Collar made out of horse hee-haw
Skeet in your wife's mouth bopped out the restroom and beemed off
Flawless jewels is real, I got jewels in my wheel
Eyes glued to your boo in her heels
The watch is a spanker, the hands don't tick
They roll, I'm in the Rolls Wraith exercise your blinkers
You just a pussy I know, hiding behind big homeboy
So one catch the bullet I'm throwing
Sitting in Polo or Brooks Brothers
Cooling on our  how the fuck we know if your clique lovers
The story we don't know that just don't front
Or he'll blow that and I'll be like "I told you cause I owed you"
Flexing at the Colosseum, not the one on Jamaica Ave
The one up in my lab with no demons in it

Beat Switch


You know the kid he stay fabulous car power
Catch him on tour few spartan's holding gun powder
Oops, let the Coupe in the duece, jump
Out with chains on, nope, just a check book and some boots
It's like The Musketeers of Pig Alley
I jump out, army, leather, beard like Stalley
A wise man told me to listen with vision
A General, old gold gangsters live in kitchens
Keith Hammers cocked, stay sucker free
Check me in the spot, glaciers on the thumb of my son
Take a camera shot, bumping tapes, rocking fur coats and 'gates
Window broke, base heads and capes
High power homies is real, blow a branch for ya'
Chef Cuba six bring out the tarantula
We like The Ringling Brothers posing in Nikes
Rocking big dumb knots, that's stupid spray your groupie up




{Yo, up in the M.G.M. coked up}, psych
Six niggas walked in flashing they gems peace (Aight
One dark skinned nigga fifty-six inch rope wrapped around twice
Smash the Gilligan boat with ice
(They threw sign language, ordered hot coffee
{wit a danish}
Relax, whispered they, "Rap entertainers"
(Had Lizzy on, two Japanese birds with furs look good kid)
Laid back handling hors d'ourves
(It's like round three) We too black for BET
You memorize the 1 to 40 (I'm at the 19th degree
If a civilized person doesn't perform his duty, what shall be done?
Pardon me God, that nigga got a gun
Bulging out his sweatpants, check out his stance
See the side of his grill? (Look like my cousin Lance
Left hand, rocky Guess watch) Yo I think I did his Clarks
He wanted crush bone leather with the strings dark
(Now I remember) He from Bear Mountain
He and Mitch Greene shot the fair one (Near the water fountain)
Seventh round, Chavez bleeding from his right ear
Yo keep your eye on that same nigga from right here
Popcorn spilling all on Liz Claiborne
(Ghost had the fly Gucci mocks wit no socks on
Seen Deion Sanders in the back with the phat fur on)
Working them hoes with the fly Wu shirts on
Mixed drink session Dun (Pour me some more)
Chef leathered down blinking at Chant Moore
Tenth round Chavez tearing 'em down) Sweet Pea get ya shit off
(It's like blacks against the Germans) Getting hit off
(Smooth and them walked in) Brownsville representing
(They sent a bottle over, autograph blessing)
Chef, pull out the doo-doo, twist the dank - pink noodles
(Yo I'm bout to roll one) Matter fact twist two of those
(Yo they wound up stopping the fight
Steels took a point away from Chavez) Rematch scheduled on October Ninth
Rematch scheduled on October Ninth




Uh-huh, uh-huh, motherfucker, uh-huh
Yeah, I see that, I see that
All y'all fake motherfuckers up in the joint, huh
Stealin' my light, huh
Watch me, duke, watch me


Yo, check these up top murderers
Snowy in the bezel as the cloud merges
F.B.I. try and want word with this
Kid who pulled out bust a shot up in the Beacon
Catch me in the corner not speakin'
Crushed out heavenly, U.G. rock the sweet daddy long fox minks
Chicken and broccoli, Wally's look stink
He with his man straight from Raleigh Durham, he recognized Kojak
I slapped him five, Masta Killa cracked his Heini for him
Everybody break bread, huddle around
Guzzle that, I'm about to throw hair on your back
Since the face been revealed, game got real
Radio been gassing niggas, my imposters scream they're ill
I'm the inventor, '86 rhyming at the center
Debut '93 LP told you to enter
Punk faggot niggas stealing my light
Crawl up in the bed with grandma
Beneath the La-Z-Boy where you hid your knife
Ghost is back, stretch Cadillacs, fruit cocktails
Hit the shells at Paul's Pastry Rack
Walk with me like Dorothy try to judge these
Plus Degrees, sessical, rasta fiends
Getting waxed all through the drive-thru
Take the stand, throw my hand all on the Bible
And tell lies too, I'm the ultimate
Splash the Wolverine Razor Sharp ring, dolomite
Student enroll holding it


A-yo, this rap is like Ziti, facing me real TV
Crash at high speeds, strawberry kiwi
As we approach your hood, the Gods bail
See Staten Island ferryboat, cats bail
Fresh cellies, 50 deep up in the city
We banned for life, Apollo kids live to spit the real


A pair of bright phat yellow Air Max
Hit the racks, snatch 'em up, son, twenty dollars off no tax
Dream merchant tucked in the cloud, stay splurging
Rock a eagle head, 6-inch height was the bird
Monday night Dallas vs Jets, dudes slid in with one hand
Two Culture Ciphers, one bag of wet
Heavy rain fucked my kicks up
Wasn't looking, splashed in the puddle
Bitch laughing, first thought was beat the bitch up
Moseyed off gracefully, New York's most wanted cheeba hawk
Seen the yellow brick road, I stole the pastries
Same Ghostface, holy in the mind
Last seen Manhattan Chase
Withdrew the six-eight digit in the briefcase
Rawness, title is Hell-bound
Quick to reload around faces, surround look astound


Yo, yo, yo
We split a fair one, Poconos money
Gin rummy with glare, spot the lame, bit his ear
Yo, and taste a teaspoon, 300 goons, stash balloons
Locked in lab rooms, hit with the Glock, stashed in Grant's Tomb
Clocked him like a patient, his stocks fall, hustle invasion
Knowing now, we copped the block off, the chain tri-color
Freezing in velour, icicle galore
Gas station light gleaming on the wall
Cop WiseGuy jams, James Bond vans
Niggas flipped Timbs, rock boats under water, watch clams
Pose for the stand-off, mad timid
Hoping that the gun fall, guessing like lottery balls, yo




Yeah, yeah yeah now, what the fuck now?
Flipmode Wu-Tang shit, what the fuck now?
Yeah yeah yeah..
Historical and monumental shit
What the fuck now? Yeah, yeah, yeah


Straight smack a nigga right in the face like this was handball
Or make a mural out his face up on a damn wall
Niggas play hard and shit; if you know what's best for you
Y'all niggas better safeguard your shit
Even though we rep brass knuckle rap
Fuck with street geniuses and bowlegged chicks who walk with a gap
Street niggas now the corporate boss
Still go to y'all resteraunt for steamed fish and Irish moss
And y-yo, the way we do it and you see how my shit bomb
Your whole show wack and I'mma cancel your sitcom
Fuck a nigga broad 'til she tired and real calm
You ain't knowin my name tattoed on your bitch arm
The way we blow SHIT is a shame
Casually bust my gun and celebrate bustin a cork on the champagne
Wrote you with a whole new approach that lead a whole team of niggas
Y'all should know I only ball like a coach, NOW!


Check out the light fixture, freak lines like white bitches
Let the mic lines - hang that slang is ridiculous
Emperor of warlords, big gun only fuck with sawed-offs
That's my specialty, more to bust
Shot out my bed parrot keep it gangster Lord
I analyze your work those that got merked were not established
Texture look classy, arm baby 2000 raspberry
S-5, blowin through Asbury
Soon to own steakhouses, glowin like makeover thousand
Them them niggas, robbin from Pinkhouse's
Show and prove, knockin off cab drivers
God, sodomize money, ring two hundred thousand
See the color of the carved out Wu emblem
Baby, it's all designers, tailor-made Wu gooses
Limousine, automatic new uzi's in 'em yo
Relax, cousin just cruise through, jewels with him


Move up the block, giant box blast my song
Non-stop strictly hip-hop, march on
Doo-rag hang long, metal tape is high-bias
Graphics, captured with the colorful, iris
I zoom in, while the listeners tune in
Some assumin they paid dues and joined the union
Lost nigga couldn't rumble in this wild jungle
Quick to crumble, type to be on the stand and fumble
Divine Master, threw on the track that made 'em bleed
He produce at unattainable rains of top speed
This powerful magnet, that left 'em stagnant
Was unlikely in cameras in larger fragments
Un-filled rifle, scout sniper, shots precise
Starlight scope, with the night vision device
Splendid marksman, that'll shoot the one off the dice
Split a grain of rice, in one shot we kill 'em twice
{*GUNBLAST*}






Stuttering
Giving 'em rest and making love again
In my best, I be the run again
And I have the man dem stuttering


I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well, let me be the first to get mine, ohh


Barbeque and blow in the back of the crib
Sitting and counting, smoking a spliff, this shit's a gift
All my niggas watches is rough, grabbing our crotches
Yelling what up? The jeans cost $500? Fuck
Stop it, keep baking, see, the smell it's a statement
One freeze of this shit, you won't feel your legs kid
I'm a gangsta corporate hustla, my voice is illustrious
Hounded by vicious dons, nigga we armed, trust me bruh
They yelling Chef, kill the plate with the cooks
I say 'Ye with 2 Chainz on, we Common, let's Push
Burn another bush, then burn another we brothers
Love us or not, the Mark Zuckerbergs of the block
Hug a knot, staying rich, we was built for the guap
Park the green six deuce on the deuce just props
Rock a kilt, mean Glock, I'm all machinery, ock
Cling to me, now see how the scenery rock?


I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well, let me be the first to get mine, ohh


I was born by a lake, chicken shack, and a church
That mean the flow got wings and it come from the dirt
Godly, I know she wanna test the 'Rari
Eye on a dollar like Illuminati
Life is foggy, tryna see through the mist of it
Could have been living it, you was Mrs. Mischievous
This is just a letter to better your development
Situation delicate


Some claim God body, blame Illuminati
All cause his pockets now knotty as his hair, yeah
All Sonny, no Cher, only solitaires
You clusterfucks could cluster up
On tippy-toe and still not muster up
So it's (ashes to ashes, dust to dust)
In God we trust, the game is all us
'til the sky calls or it's flames on us, Push


I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well, let me be the first to get mine, ohh


2 Chainz!
I'm chilling in my camo, flipping through the channel
On my GOOD Music shit, my logo's a Lambo
Four doors of ammo, ammunition I'm pitching
To make your body switch another position


I hope the people is listening, I could never sell my soul
I gave it back to God at my christening
It's tickeling when I hear what haters be whispering
What makes you think an Illuminati would ever let some niggas in?
Fake friends and siblings
Like to wish you well but ain't never flip the nickel in
Haters wanna pull they pistol when they see me in this race car
But you can't spell war without an A-R
15, I was pushing carts at K-Mart
By 21, they said I'd be inside a graveyard
Can't wait to get that black American Express
So I can show them white folks how to really pull the race card


Yeah, you feeling on top now, getting that money nigga?
(You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feeling on top now, getting that money nigga?
(You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feeling on top now, getting that money nigga?
(Naw man, mad people was fronting
Aw man, made something from nothing)


I treat the label like money from my shows
GOOD woulda been God except I added more O's
If I knew she was cheating and still bought her more clothes
It's cause I was too busy with my Baltimore, you know
Some people call that the art of war, you know
I guess it depends what you falling for, the clothes?
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw money, you sold your soul
Nah man, mad people was fronting
Goddamn, we made something from nothing




One thing you have to realize
If you opened them up, there would be a stamp under their shirt that
Says 'Made in America"
Ok, not no place else
They weren't made in Taiwan or you know, Indonesia
They were made in America


The family is the family
This oath is this oath
And I will die before I break it
And when we grow, we grow as one

"I've sworn an oath"


Late night fistfights, with bare knuckles
Nowadays, niggas probably wouldn't dare scuffle
It's big guns aimed at your nozzle, big Roscoe
Donnie Brasco wish death to they vato
Cigarette smoking, on the crater for the corner store
Same place as the ambulance and corridor
Growing up seeing dead bodies in the lobby
I used to hate the smell of it, then I got used to it
Just for the hell of it, young man, intelligent
I always know that the police was the enemy
And every dead president I make will be a friend of me
Bitches ain't shit, cuz most of them is evil
And most of them hoes start more wars than we do
Circle, cycle, three sixty trifling
When a baby is born somebody else life end
From the birth canal to the hearse, we enlighten


The family is the family
This oath is this oath
And I will die before I break it
And when we grow, we grow as one

"I've sworn an oath"


Aiyo, dead bodies found in the building, OD'ing on heroine
Early morning, needing they medicine
Elephant arms, used to control the bombs
Islam, ay Shallah, niggas bulletproof kufis
Just to live out another script in this life's movie
The corner's snatch you, murder if you have to
Dead niggas can't talk, they haunt like a castle
I wasn't the type that go out tagging
I spray your face like a PD, I was chopping and bagging
Capone-N-Noreaga, that's a blood oath, prick fingers
Like Albert Anastasia, the wildest nature
My calibrators on a higher level, I riot with the devil
Walk righteous, canaries in them bezel
Death before dishonor, money over bitches I'm my brother's keeper
I throw the world in the sleeper, I'm so eager to blast
Bilingual, I be speaking in cash


The family is the family
This oath is this oath
And I will die before I break it
And when we grow, we grow as one

"I've sworn an oath"


Shallah, a letter to the loyal, we dedicated, most of us elevated
Or fell into a pine box that's ultra suaded
Cast iron metal, new Beretta's, blue leathers
Snake bites, Timberlands, few gelettas
Reward me a God, I'm a multiple crop, multiple stocks
They violate us they get multiple shots
You might get picked off, or toast two with Heinekens
We under the building, designer gems on with uzi's, hoodie coogi's
All I know is prosper, lobster fish, this is a mobster dish
Fly around in Masi's, sipping sakes
Twenty one iron down allegiance, the days of repentance
We hate bosses, we just know the consequences
Used to sniff, pull out then squeeze, now I roll with a gift
My only rift is why we coaching them thieves
We just Allah babies, save us from the block, and keep our family one
And pray five times a day, saves alot


The family is the family
This oath is this oath
And I will die before I break it
And when we grow, we grow as one

"I've sworn an oath"


Russian Roulette, nigga, PULL IT!
Shots tear smell us when you move like you stupid
Pop 'berg, water boil bubble when I cook it
Look it, the criminal mind niggas that's crooked
Speak third person, nigga, build with my liaison
We move quiet, nigga, more secretive than a Mason
Based on, the coppers handle niggas when they bust 'em
I'm honoring an oath, while we live by the old customs
Politic with foreign niggas, regular, we fly the jets
Speaking in code, when they struggle, unravel the dialect
Every kind of foreign currency is what we try to get it
Crap table gamble, nigga, hunt your million dollar bet
Better know I must collect, hope you got it for me
And an oath is something I learned is alluded as a shorty, now
I hope you niggas don't mistake it
Will defend it and later in a grave before we break it




Yo man get ya ass in here man
You know the fucking Police looking for you man?
Come on man - them niggas just left here man
Come on man you know we got mad fucking blow
Up in the Motherfucking lab son
This nigga's off the hook man
Yo Chef talk to these niggas man


We're bagging ounces in the back of the Maz'
Ostrich on, Woolrich's, three Quarter-ness
A.D.I.D.A.S. with Stan Smith's
The grant's on the Stove
And Aunt Lo about to come to the Lab-o
She giving me some credit for clothes
That's the slang work for bricks, dicks
Analyze you neva know who looking
It's deranged world - where snitches is enterprising
Black Man hold on, like magnums in the wind
Cause when it get cold, parole give a homey like ten
What's the prognosis; drugs, guns, and ounces of Gold fish
Fly reefer outta town, bitches is stone six
And birds back with 18 and played C.R.E.A.M, gray beam
Its lean new A.D.I.D.A.S jackets, flipping up small dean
Visualizing portraits, fresh cuts, brand new Porsche's
Going with hand-to-hand, serving the Source
Yo, running from the Police
This day-to-day lifestyle where niggas get arraigned
And get chain, it's like Psycal -- blaow!!


Drug dealers, star and celebrities (Ghetto celebs)
Even dudes with a few felonies (A few felonies)
In the PJ's this what they telling me (Telling who?)
Sniffing real hard but you're not smelling me (Smell me)
The crowd yelling for 'Chef' 'Killa' and 'Pete Rock' (Pete Rock)
Got 'em moving like the millennium beat box (Beat Box)
Shit is all good 'til they hear the heat cock (Whooo!)
Fall back and let the beat rock


Degrees of experience qualifies me to speak in certain areas
Where many can't reach, so I prepared a speech for y'all
To then listen while I spit the hot venomous shit
My whole clique sick, infested with the itchy trigger finger mob related
Noodle-leanie universal flag beanie
Son you wouldn't want to see me black down, Masta .4 pound
Clip full of hallow tip round
Turn the fucking sound up
My cup running over Hennessey; the Bill Bixby
Ninja Scroll, niggas that roll
My son did four in the hole
Tenant population, neva told, facing parole
Sipped the old gold style, beat it in trial
Mild-mannered .9 bandit, flow drunk
Look at skunk weed sticking
Razor sharp rip 'em, bites lift 'em
We at the Jam direct
The ghetto gospel, collaboration
One work could change the nation
No doubt!




Tuna salad and Puma rackets pushing through the projects, captain
Get your money, yo show me no slacking
We drive the meanest joints
Shoot through Medina with a Evisu jeans and nina's
Stop by juniors we're hitting cheeba
Briefly, crackers observe
You got the undercovers
Niggas just love us, yo we know that they suckers
You know what? - What? Mosey don't be nosey yo!
Watch these fake niggas with these Thank You cards
Them shits is bogey
Snitches in the hood up to no good
We would kill a lot of mothafuckas but the timing ain't good
So while my bankroll climbing
I'll be out on consignment, breezing
Ki's with 29 letters melted the cheeses
All of my paper now in real estate
White folks been doing this since '69
It's billions and killer weights
So prosperous moves with the jewels, with Wu Nikes on
It's cool don't eva act like niggas ain't new - one!




Yeah! we just sit back - in the luxury toasters
Sliding through the mothafucking projects
Stand away from you fake ass mothafuckers
Laying up in the barberShop, getting fucked up cuts
We don't respect y'all (Don't respect y'all)
Knaw'saying? This is Shala Louis Rich
Pete Rock, Masta Killa, The Vatican
One! I'm gone




Peace God (Peace to the gods)
How you God? (Studying 120 right now
Call me back at the God Hour)
The Fuck? It's just the new way of thinking
Light up the broccoli kid
Throw the relish in my back pocket
Keep your eyes open, push your seat back, just flow
That's how we doing it


Bound by honest sword take over the set, rap from here to Quebec
Throw up the TEC, crash your intellect, select a vet
Swimsuit mammal handle, yo every fly vandal go to project
Slam you like Hamill's Whitewater Scandal
Wally sandal just a sample, my niggas fertilize thoughts
Yo mad support drink a quart then bamboo
One nasty can blew, my pen sterile won't perform if I'm not lampable
Asking my man'll get you slapped down, play the anthem
Lit it who with it champagne get it, that's the ticket
Solid nines sounding like crickets snatching worker shipment
Pull her hair, long dick it, we talk right before we left lifted
Just like a long sleeve, guess who ripped it?


Projects (My niggas survive, just like a movin' target)
Projects (Where niggas live and some sell garbage that's)
Projects (Try to escape the flying shells, dodging)
New York projects (I'm living large yo, stop miraging)


Sign of the times, conspiracy to overthrow the mind
Behind every fortune there's a crime
This technique is TEC-9
Blast at any close encounter of the third kind
This be the evil that man do, we dismantle any adversary
Them niggas all thumbs and can't handle my flurry
Hear me, you jam on, you want to scare me
Don't even kid me, shit in my coat aiming at your kidney
Pressure, red hot like chilli pepper
Black 'n Decker hardware avoid the leper
Five o'clock shadowboxer, hold down the sector
Bet your bottom dollar lecture be hard to swallow
007 mark the secret agent
That macks well and gets smart through entertainment
Welcome to the killing fields with Johnny Dangerous
Headbanger boogie niggas going through changes


Projects (My niggas survive, just like a movin target)
Projects (Where niggas live and some sell garbage that's)
Projects (Try to escape the flying shells, dodging)
New York projects (I'm living large yo, stop miraging)


Suck my dick, it's the kid with the fat knob
I bust all into your face, plus it come in globs
Quick get on your knees, with your sweet pussy, let it breathe
Two fingers is all in your hole, think I can fit three
Your pink lips, spreaded and shit, let me throw my dick in
Grab my shit and place it gently on your clit
Ping-pong pussy, wide world the womb
Titties sagging, stomach on some shriveled up prune shit
Too much air in your pussy, you screaming that it's talking you daddy
Fart's breathing out your lips, splashing my dick badly
Use vinegar to try to tighten up your ginger
Almighty dick ran in with a cape, some call him engine
Lightning rod bob, black candy cane attached to God
Thick like a Great Adventure cigar, in your garage
Pregnant pussy have you fall out, like Remy on the house
Watch the teeth for sobbing my shit, you bit it on the couch
Dry pussy leave the friction burns, plus beef I hone
The condom broke, bitch you got AIDS I'm shaking in my bones




Hey, lace your boots up, tracks get looped up
The chocolate deluxe gets scooped up
All my pigeons is cooped up, Wus up, Ws up
If you aint with us, chuck a duce up, and let us do us
Break a promise but not my group up
Veterans is dying and used up
Lets see if they can hang, Im already tying the noose up
Im too hot, if you not, get you stuffed
Get you touched and get you shot or you cut
Young buck Im just trying to toughen you up
Cant let you hustle with us, ya aint struggled enough
Yall been cuddled too much, maybe mothered too much
So the burner giving out loans here is a couple of bucks
Had a couple of scuffs, I aint saying Im perfect
I aint cursing on the rhyme but I wrote it in cursive
Quote the verses, boy I flow with a purpose
Get that proMeth and a soda, come with the purchase


Who is that up in the building?
Hashtag we still win
Raekwon no relation to Chef tho, but still trend
My youngun tell em its them
Wu-Tang is for the children
They bugging, tell em again
Wu-Tang is for the children


Lab with the pole, slide down, Im in the basement counting faces
Drunk on the slouch, count the spaceships
Jewelry to my knee caps, breathe stacks whores & sleestaks
HSBC see me getting g-packs, herringbones mad stones in em
The voice is olive green, three doors Im on bring my goons home
Pumas on, points like unicorns, fuming in uniforms
What you wanna do with me, just sue me homes
Yea Half Mike half Nike, handle got grip
Got monkeys out here ready to flip
We pull a stunt, grab knots, push cops, just for vengeance
For killing that real shit independence
Far glowing like blonde hair, probably be the way we be rolling
Lets cash a check yall bring the broads here
Until the sun burns out, aint nobody eating
We on your block now, Glock up or call the precinct

(Chorus  Method Man & Raekwon)

Bossin the set, you acting like my ex calling

Sort of like abortion I aint having it
S I ready for action, heavily cashing
We set for whatever, whats happening
Cold like the weather in Aspen, flow everlasting
4, 5, 6, your head is crackin, just a fifth of E&J and a eighth of green
No promethazine but I make them lean
Im running with the real yall chasing dreams
While the crowd go wild for their favorite team

(Chorus x 2  Method Man & Raekwon)

Raekwon no relation to chef tho, but still trend

They think that they know, something 'bout my life
Not in the same class, not on the same flight
Maybe the same club, just not the same lights
Both fucked the same bitch, just not the same night
You just took her phone number
I just took her home with a-
'Nother bitch, mnage
Boomerang, Strange'
Lipstick on my collar, Oscar de la renta(y)
Your hijo - pequeo, my nachos - bel grande
Stay sippin' that Andr
Spent 3 stacks - that's Andr
That Balmain, that Phillip Lim
They say I'm dressing like Kanye
I'm everything that my rhymes say:
Breadwinner, brand owner
Play Cloths, millionaire
Trendsetter, landowner
Hope your bitch don't land on him
Drink in his hand with the sand on him
You small time - you Hyundai's
Y'all couch niggas - we stand on em
Dope money with a band on it
Half gold, we got a hand on it
D-boys still ball the same
Just gotta little bit of glam on it
YAH!


I got flames for your download link
I let Ja Rule when I murder ink
Murder pink, murder what you thought and what you think
This Queens prodigy is the product of what you ain't
Well packaged to distribute to the masters
Plotted this since first grade classes
Class is elements of a classic
I've got evidence of a master
You never thought you'd be bodied by a bastard
A bachelor who backspin on breakbeats
Break necks of broke souls who hate me
Hate he? You can't take my heat
Fireball flow, can't bat in my league
I'm the best rapper that's been slept on
Stick around like gum that's been stepped on
Stepped on, I stepped up, so what up?
Tryna make bread with these damn cold cuts
I cold crush every beat that I touch
My words silk and my flow is pure plush
Tell HudMo Dope says "what's up?"


Go Dreamer's a looney, wish upon a star
I'm too cold for Pluto so I'm movin' back to Mars
Cause this that spaceship, that space shit
This that category 5, this that quake, bitch, that quake, bitch
See I'm so funked out, like out of here
Like blue lights in the basement
And it's a red state, in Georgia with it
Last verse, did you get it? Nah
Never mind, just throw that cash in a duffle
As I'm on my Hollywood shuffle
Eatin' your million dollar truffles, this acquirin' taste
Tantalise so you can see the bigger picture that God is the light
In the fixture or in the background
Cut all the hatin' in the background
Cause if music and money is the motive then you're so gimmick
Who's to tell me I can't have a trillion dollar grilled cheese sandwich?
Boy stop playin', stop playin'
I'm just sayin', just sayin'
Now who else wanna fuck with Hollyweird Go?


Break up and roll it, light it and smoke it
Pass it, don't hold it, lovin' that potent
I'm drunk and I'm rollin', this pill got me open
These bad hoes is gruntin', their booties is pokin'
Out them little dresses, a nigga wanna fuck
He don't even smoke but tell Butter roll a blunt
Cause I'm way too drunk and I'm too turnt up
And I brought my own drugs and I do my own stunts
Young and I'm wildin', new drugs, I try 'em
He'll call me Retch but your bitch call me Brian
In Polo I'm stylin', it's all that I'm rockin'
If you catch me out in 'Lo it's a problem
'Less it's a Champion suit, then I'm trappin'
Fuck with me, I got all this 'Lo all from raggin'
Used to have a nigga that was down to get to clappin'
Seen it on a video, he yappin' to the captain
That nigga snitchin', R86 him
These niggas trannies cause these niggas switchin'
And these niggas bitchin' more than these bitches
And I'm just so sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
Middle finger to the feds and bitches all day
Take her out to eat then I make a bitch pay
And my wine  and my shrimps sauted
And I'm chillin' in LA with a bitch for the day


Ain't that a bitch?
Foot up on the gas, ain't no brakes in this bitch
Cover girl givin' face to the Crip
Somethin' 'bout a nigga on the way to the chips
High off the money and I'm wasted as shit
High off the life and she can't get a grip
Hundred dollar cup and you can't get a sip
I'm a million dollar nigga, you should take you a flick
Hundred thousand dollar car where I sit
And my broad is the shit
Crenshaw in the 6
Got it parked at the Shell in front of all of the Crips
You either ball or you brick
She don't know money so she callin' you rich
You ain't got game so you fall for the shit
Spend it all in this bitch 'til it's gone and she split
Now you feel like a wimp
Talkin' 'bout what you was buildin' and shit
Got you all up in your feelings and shit
Problem is, she addicted to the real nigga shit
To the real nigga shit
50 dollar, hundred dollar bill shit
Gold crown on a real nigga wrist
Fresh like my nephew Khalil in this bitch
.40 cal, no concealing the shit
4 gun cases, I'm still with this shit
Backlit, wood wheel when I whip
Got her right up on my lap, that's a real nigga risk
In the field on my tip
Hoes like Phil then I Stockton assist
It ain't no stoppin' shit
Avoid the potholes, put stocks on the 6


Got Mary blowing Jane
We fucking high, sex on a plane
Hey newscaster, we about to reign
Loving the club because we fill the section with pain, c'mon
Blow him up, finna explode
All of hell's kitchen praying he don't stick from the stove
God got me, illum-i-not-me written in bold
Slept on, now I'm everywhere like g-g-g-go crazy
'Bout 150
Let me tell y'all now, I want Nicki
Lift her up high up like helicopter far away from her fellow
Let her play problem
While problem tongue play with propeller (what)
Keep fresh just in margielas
Diamond lane running thangs ain't shit you can tell us (don't tell us nothing)
Done everything, ain't shit you can sell us
Money over bullshit, friction derail us (naw)
 niggas, yeah we take it or leave it
But know it's over since I was 
You nervous like I thought you seen 
Got everybody thanking me

I'm a boss 


Cause I'm a mad man
Fuck niggas like the Klan, man
Put you to sleep like the sandman
Give me the throne, I'm a chairman (diamond)
Rolex beat, it's time for just winning, no fakes
Just copped more 45's and 9s, I ain't talking bout no J's
Please be afraid but I ain't the shooter

Riding shotty in the chevy  know as a Krueger
Lyrical Ruger, pop your medulla
You lukewarm, boy, go get you a cooler please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
So cool I could fucking die if I drop a few degrees
Boss daddy used to call the police
Get it good girl, use your knees
I love them brainiacs
Yeah, my last ho had a few degrees (for real)
Back on my Compton shit
Demonic how I demolish shit
Angelic with my intuition
Student of game make hoes pay tuition (huh)
No dice, no pill, but I'm on a roll
That one nigga that Kendrick can't control (what)
Problem


(CHECK!)
That Ambien in my ink pen
Move the brown squares like Wheat Thins
Y'all five days and a weekend
Stay smokin' on that defense
That's 2 or 3 and I'm zonin'
Got money like I cloned it
Your bitch came through and I owned it
Rims on the Caddy and I ice-cream coned it
Homie, you ain't hitting on nothin'
Drop that top when I hit that button
Pimp so hard it's a full time job
Swear, 12 stacks in my glove box
Bitch niggas, tell me what it's gon' be
Young nigga chop it up 223
Come to the D, don't hit OGs
And my advice is stay low-key
Bitch we great, bitch we great, fuckin' set
Bitch we jump up, bitch we jump up, we gotta have it
Gotta get it, we gotta get it, we gonna take it
Bitch we jump, say bitch we jump, we gotta make it
Couple racks up on them 
Your bitch here smoked my trippy stick
Ridiculous, put dick on tit, spit on clit
And it's over with, I'm over it
No sober shit, drink til I just throw up and shit
Y'all ho told me come over here
So guess what nigga it's over with
And it's over with


Fresh out the wave pool, my niggas made cool
We wrote the blueprint for the shit y'all niggas try to do
If I'm not outside, then I'm probably inside your boo
My team's official, you ain't shit, that's why she's trying my crew
Pardon me, I move retardedly
This shit is old to me, the real New York is part of me
I'm always shopping, keep it fly, Lauren is archery
Don't get it twisted, realistic, I could part the sea
My life is fast, I take a chance when I insert the key
And then I turn it up, that's really how you work the V
Your stash ain't never dry if you getting your work from me
We do this fly shit perfectly, we're enough to rise the mercury
Heat nigga, street nigga
Reflect those both when I be rapping on the beat, nigga
Looking Cambodian while standing at the podium
My flow was opium, we cock bottles and open them
Laurenovich


Stop by, tryna see a nigga
All I buy is these trees, king
100 ki's in them streets, nigga
Mask me up in grease
Sneaker game is lethal
N.Y., them eagles
Fly through, get high too
Fly as hell, might as well
Hire you the live group
Come through with that live crew
Birds chirpin', cop that Birkin
Boo, yo, I supplied you
Liable to be in Beirut, no Beirut, this debut
Slick, little niggas get gun pounding
Keep moving, who saved you?
Play who? Not me
Me and Bronson, not we
Two real niggas sitting in the East Coast
Ice is on, heat close
Fuck around and kill one of y'all clown ass niggas, word up
Take your two, take your hat
Take a nap, put your ass ton the ground, little niggas
We pound niggas and drown niggas and
Hemmied up,  that brown, niggas
All my niggas get stemi'd up
Hennessy, Louie V
Me and you, me and her
We as one and she is done
Battle rap me three to one
Freedom after, kingdom come


Triple hundred K in my duffle
Give a hundred K to my muscle
Slept a hundred days, just wakin' up
Need a brick, just break it up
Break it down, then take the cut
We shave around like a taper cut
I weigh the pound, if you hatin' us
'Bout to paint the town, most hated what
Most hated what
Grab the dice then shake 'em up
Talked hundreds since 8 and up
You lost the onions, no makin' up
No blunts but y'all fake as fuck
It's gym time and I'm shapin' up
I've been foulin', when Blake get up
You gon' waste a life, you need to hang it up
Dreams, click clack
Man down with that chrome Uz'
On his back like "nigga don't move"
Word to mother, we don't lose
Talk  like we don't move
See Gutter, be home soon
See Gutter, he'll be home soon

 x2
What's good? Talk the money, what's good?
Haters frontin', what's good?
I'm pullin' up like, "What's good?"
You know I got it, what's good?
My people's 'bout it, what's good?
Never stop, we never settle
Gotta push the pedal in that hood


I sit in the back of the room
Legs crossed, melting wax
Another free drink so soon?
All good, knock it back
Red lights, heart attack
Just a dream with no end in sight
Waking up to evening
Now it seems I live this rotten life
Spoiled rotten life, frozen hair with burning hands
Coming out to dance with other drones who couldn't give a damn
But when the night calls
Redcurrant lipstick with the lights off
Look at all the bottles lined up
Wondering who they could pop for
Golden ember to the black floor
Burning monks to 
Part of the action
Retweet, now you're the attraction
Sit around and watch them
Watch their faces and reactions
Then blur the lines until the sun
Is back on your horizon


Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Inhale, potent marijuana running shit like the mayor
Rap game Peter Parker web swinging through the air
My minds in the clouds and I ain't got a beer
See I ain't got a care kill them now and reap the benefits
Coldest nigga out and I ain't sold no fucking disc
Henny bottle-eater, 3 grams in the fuckin' spliff
Call it what you want I'm a zombie bitch I'm off this shit


Yo prada never gonna pile up
If you can't follow this game, nigga
My team smoking that green
If you ain't seen me then you must be a lame, nigga
And I'll give you three shots hold this heat down
Shorty pussy so wet she could soak a beach towel
But meanwhile, Effortless, so she thought it was a freestyle
Everybody wanna floss like a G now
What about me? Never had a bitch nigga doubt me
Zombie gang all y'all niggas pace is shit
On some basic shit it's no wonder that you sound the same
So forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it
Forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it


I heard life's a bitch so I spit and stimulate her clit
Hitting licks Henny shots hitting licks on the ave
Hitting licks who is this? that be Meech
Zombie walking casualty beat the beat till it's actually fragments
Coke off her areola and no not a can of soda
Tearing flesh pussy pink look like Cam's Range Rover
No High school diploma but baby I'm a street soulja
School of the hard knocks every class I leap over
Smith and Wesson .500, long nose, mazel tov
Shoot a man who squeal then I peel like an old cut
Like my women heightened and not even trying
And if she leaky leaky then Meechy gon' dive in
Ha, mic check check me, skin darker than Wesley
Two-eighths of shrooms got me dancing like Mr. Bentley
Mind yo' fuckin' business, why you think the whip is tinted?
The darkest nigga in it sparking up to infinite


Renegade, nigga let's get it straight from the gate
I'ma tell you what it is, I'ma tell you what it ain't
See you ain't gotta question
Or better yet second guess anything that I might say
You see not a single syllable is out of place
I rock a venue, people barely know my name
What I'm tryna tell you is I ain't gotta tell you a fuckin' thing
I'ma show so you know
Niggas either do or they don't
And bein' number two is what I won't be
I'm silencin' lambs and sheep, don't sleep
Cause my characteristics are that of a cannibal
Call this shit Hannibal Lector
My timing's impeccable, sharp like a razorblade
And you look dissectible
I've been on my mind for days
Cause homie we've been in the grind for years
Southern eagle nigga, fuck 'em all mane, we don't fly in fear
I grew up in the city where they figured they can kill dreams when they kill king
Niggas stay shot, 
I stay strapped, fuck you mean?
'Bout my green, I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
When I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
I be up all night tryna chase the check
Prolly spent it fast, I need to make it back
M.E.M.P.H.I.S, they could never stop me
Check these lames and pimp this game
Let's put it in my pocket


And they will never know 'bout all the nights that we prayed
All the meetings we took, and all the records we played
I tried to tell 'em I'm the shit, but they told us, "no way"
With no cuts, they're like a barber, they're about to catch fade
My number one rule is that I gotta get paid
I've been thinkin' this way since I was in the 6th grade
No English, I ain't talk, but boy could add
In the school of hard knocks I'm a fuckin' grad
In these Pumas I'ma run shit, high so I'm above shit
Lame ass niggas I don't fuck with
Bathing Ape trucker, I'm a fly mothafucka
My team lookin' at me like every time it's supper
Cause they know I'm gon' feed 'em, Rocky been a boss
I ain't worried 'bout the price cause I can clearly pay the cost
I'm the sharpest guy around and I'ma always cut my loss
Then come back for the win, I'ma make it, then I spin


Real west side nigga, 
Might pull the piece, somebody call a Buddhist
Your bitch put me high up on a nigga to-do list
You can do that, fuck nigga do this
And yeah I'm from the slimiest place where the bombs are pacin'
Niggas call me Jason when the guns are chasin'
Might hit 'em with the TEC, yeah the foul is flagrant
You be on gay shit
Hand in the bowl when your hand really cold
Work the light in the day shift
I don't really give a fuck as long as I get paid shift
New Cadillac, chopper, no new blade shit
I go crazy on this beat right now
I really gotta go and spit heat right now
Don't matter what the fuck it's prada
Well fitting suits eating on clam chowder
Knock it out the park like Eric Estrada
Remember I was shoppin' at Family Dollar
Got your main bitch Facebookin', beggin' for a swallow
Pop this pill then I pop my collar
Park this shit then I toss a couple dollars
Instagram, gon' post for some follows
I've been in and out my zone if you really wanna know
I got Hen and got Patron if you're really tryna go


Oh, you don't know Bamz?
I'm what the music game need
Like Rich when he just came home
And then gave the keys to a cherry 3 Series
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Fucker, that AK go chopped
7:30 my time, I'm on psychiatric watch
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Show and prove for what?
I got XXL mula, I got bitches tryna get fucked
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Now you're dead, pussy boy catch up
Pool junkie rack up, nigga, act up
Trunk with the mac truck bulletproof'ed up
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Double parked on murder lane
187 my address, Boulevard of pain
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
My cellphone backed up
My clientele meet once
No voice mail, just call me up, uh
646 684 01 01
Hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs
646 684 01 01
Hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs


As I sit back and roll up this black demeanor
Reminiscing on my past, still dreaming about that Beamer
Shit, I never was that kid in the streets gripping on Nina's
Instead, I was that nigga puffin reefer, fucking lolitas
With the baddest features
Dog 'em then it's onto the next like I do my sneakers
That was the life I was living, careless about their feelings
Caught cheating, ask for forgiveness, of course I got my way
But now I'm older and wiser, cruising through summer days
With a little Ma riding in the passenger, she rolling up that lavender
Purple cannabis rapture, head high like a Jersey in the rafters
You wing a Frazier, some smart players until we major
Traveling the world, collecting paper, pissing off these haters
Come back home and invest in something then ball out later
In five star restaurants high as hell when I tip my waiter
Providing for my seed when I bring one in this world
But until that day gets here I'm thinking about these joints, twerk


Lord have mercy
I'm so motherfucking fresh to death, better call my hearse
My hearse a 72442 with an all wood wheel and that bitch'll vert
My Oldmobile is a cold mobile
Got a cold, young chick down in Mobile
My stacks so fat can't even hold that
Fold that, lay flat like I lack no wheel
Lay flat like I lack no wheels for real
A nigga had to cold the corner, move crack for real
Move crack for real, no rap shit
But I rap rap shit, my rap shit for real
So you rapping ass rabbit ass ratchet ass niggas
Gotta listen to these raps for real
Cuz, I don't give a fuck if you a Blood or a cuz
Cause I draw blood for real
Tryna hang in my city, tryna see a bitch titty, no pity
Nigga, you'll get hit for real
These maggot ass hoes ain't hit on shit
They'll set you up for the loot shit, man
Thinking that's your bitch, better have your shit
Better have quick hands like Gucci Mane
Niggas tryna get a brick of Kathy Lee Gifford
Better be strapped like Clifford
It's the big, black nigga gripper of the big black pistol
I suggest you confess where you keeping all the money, mister
At the worst you'll see a hearse
But at the best he just will pistol whip ya
Get to see you child and live
Lord have mercy, please forgive 'em, gone


Young Del God is handsome
Your girl, she's on ransom
She don't wanna come back
Cause you don't make her cum
On the beats I do go dumb
And I do her till she numb
And I make her soaking wet when she grab that water gun
Now fuck that brag rap, man
I'm Batman, I'm Bruce Wayne
I'm kickin' it, I'm Liu Kang
I'm killing these niggas, they're too lame
Unorthodox, they too tame
I'm right hand but play left
I'll chop a trend down 'til there ain't no more plain left
Now pay respect to them gods, niggas
Not talkin' church, I'm talkin' rides niggas
On boulevards when we ride
Hovercrafts cause we fly
Q Gang 'til I die
Pyramid on my eye
Button up on my chest
 chain on top, no tie
While I'm choppin' up this Thai food
Young Del God make god moves
Young Del God say "fuck fate"
If I lose then I choose to
This that chateau rap, that shit that niggas ain't used to
Might salad fork while I choose to
While I'm fine dining on YouTube
I'm a king, I said that I'm a king
Go to Onyx with an Onyx  on my ring


I'm back in this bitch bashing
These rappers be swagger jacking
Clap 'em not, they don't even matter
1-2, this lung been splattered
And I heat a pistol on something
I keep a fifth on the belt
Pulling out the needles with the liable
Make sure it ain't sitting on the shelf
Cause I ain't light on the body
Fuck waiting in your lobby
Hannah Montana finally did grew up
I've been waiting on Miley
I'm gangbanging 'til I break my fingers
Ti'l all my family members speak the slanguage
I ain't even drop no album yet
Off mixtapes, that's how I've been maintaining
If you offended, nigga, sorry
In backs there is bodies
Have your best friend, cuzzo, uncle, pops and another
Bury you in front of everybody
If I ain't been who you are I don't fuck with you
If I fuck with you then I'm stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, I'll shoot it out
Do some years and a couple months with you, woo


Lyrically I am the epitome of a real MC
Biblically I am Timothy, visually I am Tripoli
Full of bigotry, fighting with Gaddafi over liberty
Politically I'm Barack smoking pot, sipping Hennessy
That's my only vice, old school noisy pipes
I ain't tryna be the richest, I'm cool with an M like Obie Trice
Rappers sing the same song, it must be karaoke night
That shit sound like you sang the hokey pokey twice
But this the main event, can't tell me that I ain't a prince
A one-hit wonder to your girl cause I came and went
But this that fly talk, smoke it, you'll get high off
The best thing to happen to the street since the sidewalk
Or the stop sign, or the shots flying
From a Glock 9, now the block crying, I don't freestyle, I jot mine
Call me Mr. 1-800, all I got is hotlines
These niggas tell so many stories they can overlook the skyline
Biatch


Thugger!
Y'all got me drunk as hell, uh
Now I been red since I was little like Robin Hood
They been hatin' on me, cutting my cable cords
They gon' hate on her when she come in Michael Kors
Meanwhile, your bitch in the 'Lac, grippin' this wood
I want you
She went to grabbin' for my jewels, I told her
Buy yourself a squad, you get a rollie, rollie
She know she can't have it, that shit love my woadie
She want to buy him a chinchilla
She see you serve foreign country boys from the village
Always, I gotta stand her
No, she don't want nobody to eat but her
She but like fuck them digits, stack them digits
Cut them then we benefit, cut them then we send them into
She ride three deep with molly in the middle
Put Micky Thompsons all on my Jeep
Ain't got no handprints on my golds, they all on my seat
Ten-thousand-dollar toe rings, featured by me
Bitches know it's time out
They be fucking me so good, I be like 'Time out!'
They want to fuck me 'til I tell 'em all to time out
She stroke it, I can't coach it, I'm like 'Time out!'
I'm not no snitch, but I be tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
I'm so tired of tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Now I'ma show 'em
Her posse beat me by the threes, I call 'em Reggie Miller
She roll my weed in giant ?, she tall like 'Zilla
I want you
Baby, don't you run from me, you know I want you
She down with Slime, she got a tattoo of an anaconda
Thugger getting high in London
Bitches walking 'round naked in no pajamas
Lil' homie ran off with lots of numbers
And for that, I'm gonna fuck your aunt, your sis, your mama
Then pop a pill together
She want to feel just like I feel, we growing wings together
Everything perfect about her, can't get my things together
I turn her up and we shit out earthlings together
Just do it like Michael Montana
My father say I got stamina
I cooking the Hannah Montana
I bury these hoes like Santas do
I kill every one of my features
I spend all my money on divas
My pockets on yella bands
Just like a beeper


They found Max B prints in my way
Bitch, I rode the Red Sea through my biblical days
No roof, snow boots, and that Persian Mercedes
Perving the 80's, you ain't never surf with the Brady's
Ric Flair, a heavyweight champion
Got Trish Stratus with them panties on singing "daddy's home"
Bust it, in these Space Jams, I'm a Monstar
Do-rag, tote on, that cake blocked in an arm war
So rumble, young man, rumble
Young killa when he came out the jungle
Young dealer in the rains with the bundles
Gets no realer, get chipped when you stumble
Eat the ox on the foil, ten toes in the soil
Chop chop 'till he drop, fuck what you thought
I never leave my life with a lawyer
Eyes wide with my head on the swivel
Choose a side or get left in the middle
I just treat with the sand on the beach
When the desert eagles meet, then I'm finna beat
Rest them in their sleep, you can lose 'em to the beef
Move or we shooting in the jeep
Homicide coming through the sneaks
Your hands ain't moving with your cheek
Bag 'em up and move 'em up the creek


On my test, got a story to 'em
Like all my raps weigh more than music
The more I write, the better I do it
And right now my stock is up
I do me from day one, huh
My nigga you know where it hit fours
Still fuck with me at day one hundred
Cause I don't play, I gets off
Piss off, bitch, you ain't lit
You just a nigga saying shit
Rappers burn out, Pasadena, Kansas state
Mobb Deep is that truth, liar
Prodigy is that fuel fire
Come try me, I show better than tell, Infamous empire
I'm on point like the state building
I stay sharper than razor blades
Think you doing the most, I give you the most
Slashes to the face
Hoes like "he so angry", uh
Trust me bitch, you gon' thank me
Cause when it pop and the smoke gone
We gon' walk outta here safely
Fuck with me, I got you
Real nigga, no costume
This modern art that I spit
It's not no bullshit, and colossal
So pour it up, pour it up, that's how we ball out
Cause when I bomb on these niggas it's worse than nuclear fall out


Keep the small bills separate from the hundreds, please
That bank vault can't talk but the numbers read
And the tellers makin' statements, breakin' all the codes
This ain't a mothafuckin' date, we takin' all the hoes
Shop 'til I drop, freshest corpse in the morgue
Lookin' like a fashion fossil, I'm Gianni reborn
Four, I was voted most likely to trap
It's survival of the trillest, nigga, die or adapt
Waste a lot of champagne but I don't waste a drop of time
Public with my gang relations, throwin' up the proper signs
Sawed off the shotty, got the chopper circumcised
Chevy so clean, look like I dipped that bitch in turpentine
All my homies certified, hottest nigga outchea
Look like  we burned alive
Thought that I would ball 'til I fall, then I learned to fly
Spread my wings
They say success is contagious so I share my dreams


Bolo swingin' from left to right
I'm not a cholo but I know hoes out in SoHo lovin' my ethnic type
When I smile for the photo looking like Lobo
Me and my bloodshot eyes
I pass on the Bud Light Lime
Just pass me that brew of St. Ides
Got cash, I ain't gotta think twice
Unconventional shit
Pretentious hipsters that diss
Half-assed review on Fader
Still get no love from Pitchfork
Nigel Rubirosa, que la cosa?
Feet up on the sofa
Heat up on the holster
World's Fair! Yeah, you know us
11-36-8 be the zip code
Corona, Queens nigga
That's what I call home
Feet on the dash, mind on the ass
Racin' the Sun just so I can get dome
Pimped the shorties I've been with
My friends that had me evicted
It's been two years and I'm slippin'
Still got no pot to piss in
It's everyone goes, they can suck a 
We have another song, I won't fuckin' feel it
Got my eyes on the Harley and I'm trying to peel it
Had my eyes on the bitch but she married Keaton
Got no job so I'm hardly eatin'
And you eatin' then we fuckin' beefin'
I need a pie and pizza just to meet up for a fuckin' feature


Man, they don't wanna see a nigga
Winning in a mothafucka
Happier than a mothafucka
You know lightweight grinnin' in a mothafucka
When you're a dead guy and you on that high
So the whole world spinnin' in a mothafucka
And a couple young angels hide their halo
Cause they're 'bout to start sinnin' in a mothafucka
They don't wanna see a nigga on the upswing
In a black tux with cufflinks
When you're the reason that every single girl in the party
Wanna dance and cuff drinks
When you're the reason that shit gets ran
And mothafuckas wheezin' to keep up with the plan
And the other niggas show up at your function
Actin' all anti-social, no, a nigga fan
Run up on your mama puttin' money in her hand
And you do that shit again and again and again
Pull up in the 8, goin' home with a 10
And you really can't defend or depend on your friends
Ex girlfriend wanna key up the Benz
When the Sun comes up, nigga we up to win
Mothafuck you man, all you do is set trends
And you do that shit again and again and again


Ugh, ugh
Got those motherfucking custom Roshes
Feel me?
This big beard cover my face
Until my mother gets her first crib
My hand's on some surf shit
My Spanish mami perfect
Fuck around and get your father's shirt lift
Drop a thousand on some sake and some urchin
Swing the Dodge Viper lefty like I'm Randy Johnson
Hand me the Thompson
I'll spill your clams on the carpet
Then eat some snails with some garlic
Paint the town with a harlot
Cream FILAs and Carhartt
Three-wheelin out the car lot
Put the snorkel on the Wrangler cause I'm silly
I chip a little piece of brick into the philly
My daughter's neck is chilly
My son's neck is chilly
My mother wrist so cut
Look like it got bit by a grizzly
And these drugs got me spinning like some capoeira
Still rock the slow beats with gold teeth
Ain't afraid to hold heat
Control the Jeep
That's for the slow creep
Ya fuckin' pussy smells like old meat
It's me


Heema the highest human, flyest cumin in my unit
I ?, the shorties swoonin', and they want to get to spoonin'
Never wished i was taller, himanshu ain't no midget
Never wished i was a baller, if I want it, then I get it
I built a fucking blueprint, like who the fuck you kidding?
I;m ridin' around and I'm gettin' it, if it's mine, i'm spending
You lames and you fall, i'm like 2 Chainz when i ball
Got Husseins on my feet and Husains on my wall
Hussein Chalayans, a pretty girl said that's fancy
Unless his name is Hussein, give a fuck who your mans be
My shoes got dials, they ain't got laces
If you got beef, I show up with many faces
Been to many places where we leaving many casings
Running 'round, man, but we never catch no cases
Give a fuck about what you say, kicking it with like two babes
Top off, toupee, hot as fuck, creme brle


There's no way I can care about much
You probably do the most and it's never enough
King Midas, I can make gold with a touch
Change my location to awesome, you should address me as such
Swear this game, you have to know it like the back of your hand
Destined to be like Superman for as long as you can
Wondering what's the purpose without living a life so grand
The worst hand is having the world without a master plan
I feel like you gotta pardon Mike for taking over this Earth
Despite sleepless nights and long flights
And I don't like discussions unless it concerns a price
If you make it out of spite, you still make it so it's alright
I spit magic, so cold and lavish
Bad broads perform sexual acts in traffic
So smooth, the saxophone and jazz is
It's horrendous what you lack and focus on what you have in the G
More than average, I'm nothing to test
If it's to me, you step and contest, then bring your best
Give it your all, now women beg me to call
And unless we overseas, we don't shop in the mall
Consider this move so private I've become urban myth
My aim is so swift, with this I can't miss
Top notch, number one on everybody's list
I promise to kill them all til everybody's missed


I never sell drugs, I took 'em
I don't write rhymes, I cook 'em
I'm from the Old New York
Where you got your chain snatched
And your kicks tooken
I put my city up like I'm bench pressing
Scorin' high off the 
Brutal, last in 10 seconds
Jolly good, body good
I met a stripper named Hollywood
In Hollywood, glass slipper
And she gave me the sloppy gooooood
So you should tip her if you execute
Young leisure suit
Larry with no extra loot
My ex left me destitute
So chances are I don't remember you if I slept with you
You want karats, I'm turnin' rappers to vegetables
City of God, I'm askin' what would the devil do?
Instagram it, I forever rule, Ricky


Super villain, I'm killin', kick in the door
Watch me spillin' 'em, fuckin' winnin'
Straight killin' haters, they catchin' them feelings
See me grillin', me drillin', like we chillin'
But really see I'm fulfillin' their fantasies
Like I'm fuckin' my frienemy
Yo what's up, see me on motherfucker tryna get buck
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
So what's up? Where in the world did he get that from?
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
No damn, no shit, zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
 zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come

 x2
Need ? Well I got it right here
Need motivation for the ass to gon' twerk? Well I got it right here
If you need a thing, a thing, then I got it right here
 I got it right here, I got it right here


Most of these niggas gon' hate
Me and my niggas get paid
One nigga swing then we all gon' swing
We all gon' catch that case
Couple blunts to the face, got a nigga straight
Rappin' on beats got a young nigga made
What can I say? My closet got Bape
I don't do delays, I want it today
Noisy pack in my wrap
Hennessy in my cup
Ginger ale if I chase
But I really don't do that much
I really don't have no time
You ain't tryin' to get no funds
Doin' this shit 'til I die
I'm rollin' and smokin' on drugs


Rollin' up, chokin' up on the kush smoke
Whip sick, big wheels, Big Willie shit
Hot boxer, hot sauna, car full, thick
I love the constituents, is down to get their lids peeled
Still pimpin', ridin' 'round town gettin' low
With my bright skin shawty, call her light show
She like Reese I'm tryna light that
Show love, she hold me down like an ice pack
It's big faces on faces bruh
Big faces on faces bruh
Dead men in my pockets got me goin' up
It's goin' face down if a nigga flex us
Yeah, in God we trust, but bands is a must
We gotta get that, spend that, get that
Re-up, recoup, repeat that


Say deuce 9 in that ending
Been winning since the beginning
Did a couple shows, need a couple more
That price right but we skippin'
But to our niggas, we gettin' it
With that work I turn into a chemist
Walter White, send a  to my niggas locked up in prison
Free my nigga Chris
And free my uncle Marky
Now tell them they fucked up
When they told 'em they could start me
Cause I ain't lettin' up, they're talkin' 'bout the best
They better mention us, yeah they better mention us


Apartment off 
Rottweiler just to watch 'em
Maybachs for the profit
Get a Lexus for my mama
Hail Marys for our fathers
Press the pedal to get farther
In that new thing
No tags, nigga, fuck the dollar
All about it so don't fuckin' bother
My loose change got me Bruce Wayne
And a 3 page spread
Y'all was sleepin' on the flow just a couple months later
Now y'all purchasing the flow, East Coast


King, god, pharoah
Feared the sensei, gold for bone marrow, save
My name is running coyote
I'm on peyote with the queen, running on waves
I will make water out of Hennessy
Target my ankh, I was born a public enemy
Reign insurmountable
A woman will make me climax but she won't be ending me
This is not a dream, marchin', in all black
A Black Clan king
Respect the illustrator
Don't you dare ever try the Elohim, fuck flexin'
I say my name when I name drop, son
Who's the god in this pantheon?
Two-9, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan


Get up trick
Put your head to your knees like a sit-up, bitch
Get too live for the crew, Two-9
We're the new 2 Live Crew, give up, bitch
Send 'em all to Hell, kill this shit
Spit it like braille, gotta feel this shit
Gotta check up, haters still 
Yellin' kill 'em all and I'm on ball like I'm Billups, bitch


Runnin' our heart, sit up bitch
Hard to go to sleep, all we know is work
Catch no Zs, chilled on purp
 came second but my bills on first
East Side nigga, still my turf
Pierce like 'Matic, hoes still at it
Swing like a batter and my crew goin' at it
Best believe that that shit gon' hurt


Toot up the French horn
The fog machine is sandstorm
Ain't go to camp
Cordless toward the performer that's keepin' your amps warm
'Fore the fans swarm
All but the limousine, swear to God that's in between
Indigo indie dream, you intervene
Yeah that's a Spit sixteen
Hearts inside of my tip jar
Like a bleeding heart beneath wood floor
And if every lion is purrin'
Then I'ma be certain I let my engine roar
I'm swingin' swords and swingin' chains
Singin' pure and bangin' strange
This Alexander Spit and I'm off the wall like 
I'm changin' lanes
Driftin' around whatever it is this game became
Like gorillas and orangutans
Go bananas and bangarang
They say I'm prayin' to that cross
For all of that fifteen minute fame
But I'ma get my 
And the god's here
So baby just open your bra zip
And just let them titties out
And let 'em bounce like this was Paul Revere
I'm 7.0in' on Pitchfork
I'm 10-0in' on this court
This Alexander Spit  with a pistol
, I got this


Better have my check, I need that first
Before I move, before I step
See I been burned it don't take long
And learn quick, it ain't no twice
I gave my time, I gave my life
So I won't bet what all I spent
I'm trying to be good, I'll take your bitch
And I ain't even playin, just ask my clique
You know my steez, trying to get real A-Town
Got that or either got sump'n to give away
Big feet on the bottom of a Chevrolet
Everybody and they mamma sell plenty hay
Need to ride with the weight scale
Propped up in the seat trying to get that
My ? on a eastside ho ?????
Tell Bron Bron we can bring the Heat back
I'm a champ, I support it
Flipping through the hundred
Cool Club with it
Running to the money
I'm in shape, I'm in shape stacking cake
Duncan Hines go get "Faith" thats my last tape
I'm on 10, I'm on fire, I'm on point, I'm on smash
Rolly on my dash, breaking down in my Cad'
I'm Atlanta, ScottyATL ho 1 space that's a Y not an IE
Slipped in ain't even check ID
Game need me I'ma rap IV


Year before '83, I be the kid who found ET
Tell him teach me all he know, prolly make him smoke some dope
Call a bitch over for throat and put her on some game
Just to get up in her brain and now she out makin' me change
I'm full of dynamite, throw her on the blade, no Wesley Snipes
Young Roxanne, baby, sell that body to the night
I'm trife as fuck, light the blunt, get high enough to die for once
Throw the pad at Christ, they askin' God how do I write this stuff
The Lord never liked me much, but I'm sayin', "Oh well"
Blazin' up with the devil, watchin' old Hell in the Cell
Matches your favorite actress, blasted, naked on my mattress
Polygraphs break, you say I ain't the illest nigga rappin'
The fucking  captain of this multi million dollar faction
Commander and chief
My sons is Son of Sam with the beef
We get loot, always ran from police
You bitch niggas lose your head if you speak
I ash the doobie off the cruise ship
And flew hash, cheffin' out of Ruth Chris
Two bitches tellin' me they do sniff
What do you know?
So much wax in this blunt I'm smokin'
You'd thinkin' I'm fuckin' Madame Tussauds
You think I'm fuckin' mad, I'm too so
I'm out of it, bitch, oh
Nah, fuck that
Bring them fuckin' trumpets back
Light a dub sack for my niggas who slung crack
On a daily basis, sip liquor, I never chase it
Fucker I'm the greatest, carve a statue of my face, bitch




I set it off in the sunny distance, no days existed
My patience led the way 'til the greatest love listened to me
I used to play the witness, wait in the trenches
It's like the sixth man, sits on different benches
It's hard squeezing life in a sentence
And if I do, roll carpet with the red tint
My entrance is what's between
When I exit, it's Evidence left on the scene
Alchemist cut the record down, to the bone
And with a record like this I take the world by storm
It's God blessed, the land of the brave
Understand where I stand, my hand is made
From B-R-double-O-K-lyn the planet
Family landed, managed to raise the man that I became
Panic on my first campaign
But when the words fell in place, I was certain to reign
I hit the purple then step in the circle and start flexin'
Weatherman invented, now storms change directions
Portions of my proceeds is feeding my homies now
I always shared pretty good for an only child
I was the baby boy, I could do no wrong
Now the role's reversed, I'm putting people on
They off welfare and got healthcare
They used to have their priorities elsewhere
I took rims and tires and traded them
For a ticket to an island, that's where I wrote this rhyme in
Where I first saw my vision written
Driven by a better living and place to raise kids in
So I think like I rule the world, on the brink of something bigger
Building schools for boys and girls
The thought alone gets me out of my bed
I said you got the tools, get them shits up out of the shed, c'mon




I'm like the Emmitt Smith of rhymin', the Jack Dempsey emcee
All my shit customed out, hold the fort eventually
Money is made, fly blades
A woman with brains, it help a black nigga reign
My lifestyle as a prowler; a rich loner, owner
Used to pump at coffee shops, had my bitch Roselle with me rolling up
Fly ass and still classy, asking questions like
Why you wait on that glass, why would you splash me
Yo, it's only nigga shit
I'ma teach you like I was taught to
Hold the fort, walk through
Seeing all kind of grey fossils
Colossal jewels, bigger house, act fly, I got you
No need to walk backwards, fuck up the taxes
My street credibility is stronger than NASA's yeah
Yo a diplomatic winner, Nike boots
A skully good denim jean on, and one-rent em




They say you only live once, I disagree
You only live twice, your life and then through your seed's
So I bleed on wax and feed them the deed
So when I die they got the foundation on my publishing B
Plus the words that I speak, here's my family jewels
It ain't all blood diamonds, but life experience tools
And I be rhyming cool but my philosophy's deep
Like a Dear John letter, so read em and weep
And the wolves smell blood, you can feed em the meat
But Im a lycan, Underworld we can meet in the street
Draw heat, but what happened to peace
He got a Dirty Sanchez, like what happened to Screech
Jesus, diarrheas, I mean holy shit
Christ on a cracker, that's just how we spit
Communion, add the wine, make the sign of the cross
And I don't live in the past, chalk it up as a loss
Went from, please listen to my demo to stretch limo
To the pen in a cell watching Eminem on Jimmy Kimmel
But I can't go out like Kimbo Slice
Like Gina Corano, I'm a Cyborg we terminate
Mano a mano, still Ronald McDonald, over one billion served
But it's up to me to get what I deserve
So I handle my biz and hustle harder than the norm
The early bird gets the worm, but the hawk gets the bird




We here, lord
Let's go, lord, come on


On top of my game with cuban linx in my chain
Iconic, icon victorious, whenever the mic is on
Stay gettin' it if this foul place see the semi's clapped
Bad Brazilians with hourglass figures and doobie wraps
Wordplay is wicked as wild flour, this wild power got me flyin' over the globe
'Mega, where you be at? Not where I be
Rich, wealthy and ruthless in Morocco blowin'  , striving for more chips
Steady cheese, guap, papes, bread, C.R.E.A.M, whatever
From the projects to small islands, stylin', we run together
It feel good, don't it? Compliments from yours truly
Some people doubted but, but fuck it, my source rules
Judge wise when I'm connecting dots, I'm so smooth
Make a toast for the king diamond, I'm that dude
Fantastic, repetitive classics
My style's made to dress you, I style on you bastards


From the drug game I learned how to stay focused
Back up in this, yeah, getting the world it's fix
Hustlers mentality, you know me, son, for slangin' that shit
Apply the same rules to music and watch words flip
From the drug game I learned how to stay focused
Back up in this, yeah, getting the world it's fix
Hustlers mentality, you know me, son, for slangin' that shit
Apply the same rules to music and watch words flip
And watch words flip


Yeah, son, yeah, son, sick
That's Jameson's
You know how we do
We coming out with nothin' but the raw
Let me tell you nigga's somethin', man
We here, lord
Y'all know nothing about this life, man
Let me tell you one time


Glorious, wine deliverer
Givin' y'all somethin' so fruitful, truthful
Hard felt celebrating this legacy, longevity
I define it, garments, they all designers
Shoes that be the brightest, my women that be the finest
Dining, five star restaurant, exotic shellfish
Prominent gift, kush cologne, I smell rich
They tell me not to shine, I can't help it
It was meant for me to floss, and make hits 'til them digits add more comma's
Artillery for drama, beaucoup armor
Let the piranhas eat up a hater's flesh, sleep and  pyjamas
From a 
Number one Don, Lex so sophisticated, educated
Word complex, throughout your project echoes
And y'all ain't heard half of it yet
My badge is that of a vest
Signatures, anxious to sign more checks


From the drug game I learned how to stay focused
Back up in this, yeah, getting the world it's fix
Hustlers mentality, you know me, son, for slangin' that shit
Apply the same rules to music and watch words flip

And watch words flip




Dear, this is most inconvenient
Now I'll have to call out the reserves


Aiyo, drugs from Philippines, guns and guillotines
Murder land triflers in the hood with killa genes
Car hard jumpers and seeds is gold robers and them cheebas
Fresh off the block, note the leeches


Aiyo, machine gun rap, Maybach floor mats
Panel door suicidal, you see my rivals
Keep the sour puss face, I keep the kush case
Phillies unravel, Earth smoke spending with me
Afghanistan headband, that straight sticky
Empty pillow cases with the soda and the soap in them
With my Indian niggas that only sling opium
It's Shallah, my Chinese dudes, take they Shahada
In sweatshops, cutting them things from Guatemala
My rosary beads is blessed, came from the mountains
Used to sell dust juice, water like a fountain
I meditate in a room full of rich rugs
Stretch coke like yoga, deep like Yoda
My chronic is green they call it Shrek like ogre
Militainment, Icewater, water that freezes
Them hand to hand on the block with them pieces




Check this military regime, mafia, guns from Czechoslovakia
We eating bread getting stockier
Army apparel, draped in the Vatican, you rocking that last year
The bulletproof vessels is cashmere
Burning in a hostler, or toast ya
The east coast go Cosa Nostra, heart cold as Nova Scotia
Ramble like Che Guevara, I ran the Reagan era
Word to mama, now I smoke Obama in a grey Carrera
That's presidential kush, blowing outta bongs that fiber glass
Seventeen thirty eight Remy
The semi hold bullets that size of a little penny
Block stars, not a rock star rocking my jeans skinny
For parole violating fugitives on a run, son
Live by the gun, son, die by a dumb dumb
It's not where you at, it's where you come from
Laundry mat travel wash money by the lump sum, get it






See they think I'm a fuck nigga
But if they ever see me then they might have to duck, nigga
Like what, nigga?
Before your ass can answer get your whole shit bust, nigga
Done rose out them ashes, drinking Fiji water
Wanna pull me in that fire while I'm tryna feed my daughter
Wanna snatch my momma's plate, and tell her she can't eat
And we gone have us some discrepancies right here in this skreet
Because the weak don't speak, get left in silence
And when you don't listen, gotta speak with violence
And duct tape the grandmomma, strip a man of all his honor
Tryna be a G, now you wish you a goner
I walk with the Gods with a tongue for the devil
Tryna keep a nigga thirsty so for rain I pray mercy


The return of the gangster cause niggas don't believe
I roll hotter than my sleeve, leave a nigga in the street
The return of the gangster cause niggas got bills
This rap shit don't work then its back to selling krills
Return of the gangster cause niggas want that real
Want that old Danny Brown but nigga I'm like chill
The return of the gangster fuck a hipster squeeze a trigger
You got me fucked up, I'm a hood-ass nigga


Eastside niggas keep roaches in the ashtray
Twenty thousand out the public housing on a bad day
Drop it in the pot, if it ain't locking that's some bad yay
Tryna save my soul I wish the lord would meet me half way
Devil on my shoulder as I'm whipping up this yola
And that motor hit the rotor ship this blow to Minnesota
Only option is a shoot out if the police pull me over
This shit get realer than shit that's on your Playstation controller
Call of Duty ass nigga, dick in the booty ass nigga
Don't po' up roll no dough up and I don't get no cash with ya
Feel like fuck the world it ain't no friends up in this business
Fuck my label show them I'm the real realest nigga in it
Gangsta Gibbs, bitch...


It's the return of the gangsta, thanks ta'
These phony ass wannabe thug perpetrators and wankstas
Your white tee turn to tie-dye, nigga I red paint ya
Won't stress or cry about it, cause it's not in my nature




Yeah waasup ya'll, we in the building
Theordore motherfuckeer!
Yeah, Tokyo Tribe 2, Saru santa, Mushasino goonie
Ya'll niggas know how the fuck we get down, it's all real
J-Love in the building, this how we take it


I told them up the block niggas to fall back
Dope fiends is dropping, crack heads buggin off Prozack
Whoa, ghetto celeb, shark skin threads
Chicks, we dont fuck em unless we take em like three in the bed
Jumped and bagged up something heavy
Some mothers resort to getting rich off Newports
Back and forth to Delaware and VA
Yeah you can't blow, they takes hella years
Base heads taste my shit like "Starks, what the hell's in there?
Usually millionares really rare
Yellow Lamborghini with mustard suade seats with a bar in there
Even your seeds had a benatar play pen
Your moms is taken, she got shot during number runs
A visa, jeans, buck fifty when a drilla(?) come
And his sister gave birth to a killer son
And that be yours nigga, you gon regulate the globe
With your arm and your big world tours


Gun in hand, makin moves in Japan, living off land
Half a kilo in the closet, sitting on grams
TU be the grahm cracker, shells like clams
If we don't know you, then we'll blow you, only fucking with fam
Historicle name, Theodore, nigga, we be the Roosevelts
Shoot flames like Godzilla, it make the soldiers melt
Tokyo Tribe, DJ Muro, king of the digging
Crazy yen spending like ?winnin?


Diggin daddy, ammo is brolic
Fila sneakers and suade goose, walked in the joint like a paid scholer
Give me all my chedder in fives
Light blue, five fifty by the door,  i had my ho with the nine
How you feeling soldier? Fill up my glass
Threw my hand on his neck, my ring scratched him, that's six, carry smash
Of course he ain't want none, took it like a trooper, then walked this New York Nigga
?? got cash
Plus his fiends mad loyal
Seen him under the building, and after five niggas turned the
Shooters on hood soil
And the judges love him
He threw a baby in one of the cufflinks daughters, and six months later he snubbed him
Had CNN wildin, the Staten Island veteran smiling
See through Johnny ??, stomach still growling
Some Japan nigga, and the fam with him, holding some thing
I think he bought Burger King, he got strings tho




We gon talk real talk nigga
Straight up, bring that paper out man
That's the only thing we respect nigga, you gotta stay fresh nigga
And you gotta have money nigga
You put all that bitch shit to the side right now, and talk about major shit
Word up man, Icewater Inc, a bunch of dalmations man
We gona nigga, uno, my nigga Muro, DJ Muro rather, Saru hold it down
Lex Leonardo nigga, we gone nigga




Regardless, we all ninjas, and got money
But the theme of the story
Is yo, checking how they came for me


Kinda brief from the gold teeth era
Bro dreaming on C.R.E.A.M
Complimentaries and beef
I'm from the wild side, a militant was made by the foremost elite
It sound good, brung my rifle shit, clean
Met the others, lit a blunt, begin
I'm like Nicole Kidman in the wind, niggas is wild, niggas is eat
Then I chanced it, blood can always beat mud
Mud is part of being thug, I guess it's advance, we from the street
This is me, I'm ready to beat, whatever, we gon' off' it
One time alone, yo, they pricked up Unique
Meth standing there, rare hustler hair, right in front of the building
Them niggas do them killings out there
This is deep, me, Rebel, U-G, he walked in the room
Scarf rap, pair of Timberlands, beat
This the potion, roll the scroll out, speaked and another walked in
Knowing now this is a thief
We from the same voc's, this is like a pot roast
Hottest niggas who rhyme, I know them from the time
This is not 'posed to happen
Peace Black, we wasn't cool
Threw the piece back, everything good, I lit the leaf, captain
Got a mission, to make sure the world recognize our position
I'm standing near the kitchen
Shit just might work, I lit the stink, this could be the realest shit
This could be the realest flip quick
Everybody stand up in militant, army jackets down
I said to myself, this the realest clique
True champ, we gon' rep it through, keep it cool
No boot camp, no hard work, just some loot, family
All in, ball til you fall, loyal as ever
I grab my leather, I'm a lay til you call


Generals, demons, nighttime, vultures
Caught up on the ropes, let's team it
Everybody seen it, Zenith, what you mean?
Everybody C.R.E.A.M.'in', the all American dream




Good Morning, Good morning
Time to get up

Look at the sun so pretty today
It's so bright, it's so smashing
Lasting, helps out the grass and
Smile when it's morning time
Last night I wrote 3 rhymes, I woke up to see the sun shine
If, God is my witness
In scriptures and pictures
The Sun kiss scrumptious son, it's nutricious
It makes me wanna climb
Take a bite out of shine
This little light of mine
Yo, the sun could never be pussy, he always come out
He'll sit right there, even if you pull your gun out
He can never run out, when the lights go out
It's Japan's turn now, the earth has spun around
I see Yellow and Green, it's a beautiful thing
The sky's blue, 'cos the sun hit the water like "BING"
A reflection (uh-huh) and that's all it is (word)
You can't stare at him long, cos your face'll do like this


Look who's shining again
(Oh My My MY)
We've Been Rhyming again
(Oh My My My)
Ice be blinding the men
(Oh My My My)
We come through time and time again
(Oh My My My)


Check out my nephew
He jumped up in the window just to see you
Look what he drew
A car, house, always wants to be with you
He's just as Jolly, He always begging me to let him see you
I'm like "probably if you clean up, and read a little"
You make people eyes glow
You got the weather channel bugging and you stubborn when it snow
You my mentor, Mothers name their Kids after you
New slang, nothing personal, we knowin what you been through
(Sun) You roll like, one in a million yo
(Sun Sun) You always find like, one in a building yo
We those babies from day one
All I had was you on my birthday baby- think you owe me one
The way the world look when you around
Prisoners get out, look up, run at you and then kiss the ground
You my favourite, I wish we had three more of you
I adore you, plus I even go to the store for you




I would die for a sun , can being richer and cruel
Reachin a full 98, and got the kids in the pool
Isn't it cool how it spreads joy, hons lay in it
And it's hard to go back to work, when your lunch breaks finished
? before, so it's a fact I support
Feeling the warm sun rays, upon your back as you walk
The heat-driven, A theory I plung to deep living is
Souls have to go through the sun to reach Heaven
And, sensing retreat, our souls badden the scene
Madame believe, since dinosaurs, and Adam and Eve
That Sun's hovered, to the extermination of us
It's a peephole, which leads to the firmament above us


Who can take a raindrop and turn it to glee
And drawn up 6 miles, over tropical isles and bring it to the sea






Mot got me acting like a fucking goat in here
Yo god, remember back in the days god?
When we came a long way and shit, man (no question)
We supposed to be blessing each other
On our physical days and shit, you know what I'm saying?
It's like basically, I wanna hit my family with like land and all that
Diamonds and all that, we ran through that chamber dun


Mainly stack mine, indeed it's been a long time
Let me feed y'all, fruits of life, shut up and eat y'all
Flavors for neighbors, Wallee's down to gators
The whole configuration stacking paper
Yo we do this, on the low though
If so, we running John Dolo
First thing, you need if you don't know
We carry cause it's a real world, show and prove
In ill words, all my herbs know the slurge
Dress nasty like fuck, keep my bird on the job yo
You got to straighten up
Do the worst thing to hurt her heart, damn
Took care of that, shared, even shed a tear for that
Bust my gat to throw gear on her back
Damn son, why she taking you through that?
She's a part of me, pardon me flow Allah, we sworn we
Wising up, take care of home bases
Then we slide to another part and start more hatred
Life is sacred - the other side of that paw, you lie naked
Clothes in the box, go 'head take it
Flash back Jew status
Salute moms and get ya boots splattered
Batting average, your moms had it
Just a broke young dumb, full of cum ready to haunt something
Takes something of yours, here you want something
Growing up around fifteen
Watching how the big niggas rolling wit big cream
Big schemes
Quick to flash your gat, laser beam
Pool table action black, hundred stacks made my niggas leave
Some be saying "Let em breathe"
The others wanna deceive
How we gonna make it if we don't achieve?
Right now, catch it from a vertical degree yo
We starting showing our asses, committing burglaries
One got caught, threw us all off
Threw us in the hell section near the boardwalk
Wondering how the sword talk, did he fall off?
Did he stand like the hawk that he was in New York?
Kept the waves spinning on the cross, of course
Come back a little cutty endorse
Risked it for his kids the pain is lost
We sitting back on a better note, yelling "Peace god
I love you love you to death, you thoroughbredable"
The Robbin Hood of the hood
Sit back, it's all good
Won't spoil it if we call it, we all hood, ha ha


I make knowledge born to save self, you know?
Who gon' live it, gon' live it
Be is to be a born, know what I mean?


Soaked in degrees of knowledge, polished by sun rays
Carving by nine swordsmen
To a needle point of perfection
It's a blessing to deliver this lesson
While traveling the planet, extending development
And vote for the mind
Never ended we now send it long winded
Descended infital, Bobby Digital
Abbot of the Shaolin 'Isle
With knowledge and wisdom
Of the original sword style begin
Birth of the Wu-Tang Clan

For real



"Everywhere I turn, I see, your face..."


Yeah, ah, yeah, yo, yo, yeah
Yeah, motivate, motivate, from the gate, ya'll
Yeah, aiyo, aiyo, aiyo


And we the Gods, still tear the whole hood apart
Darts that'll splatter through faces, taste niggas hearts
I'm intellectual, plus professional
And Walbaums to vegetables
Shit is right here, like buyin' fly gear
Dare any white man or fan nigga, ran through niggas
Blew shotties in niggas lobbies, the grand RZA
We left, the radio broke, I yoke my vocals, hittin' green smoke
Allah Math', show me when the needle broke
Numb the whole crowd up, stupid ass Loud fouled up
Never knew what they had, now they proud of us
Picture my vision, precision, lines jumpin' out of commission
Divine got me, nigga, the boss, he pop me
Rae, we gotta generate, lord, I feel the Ditech, the mildew
Buy jets and vehicles, steal a little
Wrap up the whole rap government


Go head, ya'll floss wit it
Walk wit, I slap your boss wit it
Navy blue, New York fitted, I'm cold frost bitted
Two puffs and off wit it
You smell the herb, 'fore I lit the spots its forfeit it
Blocks is hot, feel the shot from fourth/fifth it
With no regard for your boulevard, just the shit bag and bullet scar
It's the Riddler, riddle me this, riddle me that
Who the pretender? And who the door man that let them enter?
The Wu-Tang, 36 Cham', what you smokin'?
Got you in the game chokin', like Van Gundy coachin'
Your street team, bunch of weaklings
Don't ever let me catch your reachin'
Respect when a grown man is speakin'
Shh, keep on sleepin', and just like TLC, I keep on "creepin"
The five percent of ya'll, keep on teachin'
The heat seakin', missile official, that got issues
Like Funk Doc got snot tissue, it's Hott Nikkels

"Everywhere I turn, I see, your face, but you're never there"


Shh... shit ain't over..
Okay, now, same shit, different day, grindin', gettin' paid
Self at it, automatic, guns that spit and spray
Gotta have it, ass grab it, time to slip and weight
Godbody, House your Party, watch the Kid N Play
Ya'll gon' make me go postal, up in this muthafucka house
Full of bloodsuckers and hoes that love hustlers
Roll that izza, pour me another kizza
Bigga, to my nigga, so drunk they can't get up
Shotguns through nose, hot ones through foes
Let the herb spots run til the cops come, suppose
I was just another stick in the mud, on a Saturday
Thinkin', how I'mma get the fifth in the club
See my crew thick, everyday I fights to prove it
We comes undisputed, with batteries included
Honey's "bee" like Meth, I be like what?
They want some free cd's, I'm like "see these" nuts


If ya'll muthafuckas gettin' high tonight, say all right, haha
If ya'll muthafuckas gettin' drunk tonight, say all right, haha
It be Tical, ok, haha, yeah, yeah, ok
It be Tical, ok, haha, yeah..





 You know how it go. You know how it go
 Uh-huh, uh-huh
 There's many out there
Many duplicate faggots
 Check this shit, son
 No question. You know how it go, son
Ice Water, Ice Water


Infinite gangsta shit,  check it out
In-stoppable, in-touchable, you couldn't flex on me
If you was right next to me
And you wanted to (c'mon)
I take you fuckin' bullets - let's do this
P is deadly, he's just like his music
Come through like the Taliban unit
Catch me by myself, I'm only sayin' bullshit
I don't switch up, I won't change
You gonn' have to catch my body to sell my brain
An' that's simply the truth
Niggas wanna flip on me, we makin' the news
And hopefully, I'll be makin' it home
But if not, it really makes me no difference, it's whatever, yo
Fear's not an option, man that shit is childish
Squeeze your gun, just make sure I'm finished
My style is Porsches and XL trucks
But my presence alone'll make the good girls fuck

I see they wanna rhyme just like P
They wanna copy off me, bite my jewelry
Used to scream on they song
Now they rhyme calm
Takin' pieces of my verse like I care
Y'all, they wanna be, just like the Mobb
They wanna observe us, bite our style of dress
Bite our style of rap. I see all of that {*echoes*}


Aiyyo, aiyyo
Shoebox with nothin' but bread
The lead fly out the magnet
Dragged it by his brain and his leg
Where I'm from, niggas is dead
But only bury light niggas, some that take get outta dead
I live like a champ, gun king, thumb ring
The joint that Kobe gave his girl, that's my son, bling
Sooner or later it's war
How many good niggas die? That's the meaning of New York
A powerful armour, ration it, all this is tailor made stuff
That's me fuckin' with crackers
Chef got a iller mood, real deal dude
A hundred bar marksman, shoot up the booth and move
What you wann' do, lose?
I bet all my niggas right now be stealin' ya food
We come from where the babies get blessed, yes
This my proposal : come and buy haircut's fresh

I see they wanna rhyme just like Rae
They wanna cop me all day, watch me in the Mae
Flyin' on my way to the bank
Yellin' "Goodness gracious, the hood won't even say thanks"
But I got a trick for niggas
Cause when these heads get up, it's no friends, just business
Problem? Meet me in the yard
The Ice Water clique with a hundred bars, let's get involved


Two-three, I'm back out with big Kay Slay
New place here, muh'fuckers screw up his face
You wanna hate? I'm alive, nigga, grew to embrace
All the tribes and tribulations, only few do escape
Been through the chase, the incriminatin', the case
No feel, the cold steel still the weight in my waist
One of the great, eighty-eight, young with cake
Duffel bag full of hustle, cash, gun in the safe
Some would relate, others wanted rap replaced
The nigga's style is how they know me now, but nothin' is play
Involved in violence heavily, indirect
In car low, with it tinted up, in our reps
Been large before niggas had to guard they chest
Before them boys in L.A. put The God to rest
B.I.G.! Get money, or starve to death (Yep)
Got killers among me, dodgin' the rest
Got my (?) in the hood, disregardin' the press
No disrespect, I'm a brother so pardon my (?)
Blood blower, rep for my boy to follower
She the thrower, the whole jail house roust, they all know her
More soldiers, it's a war in the game
Some niggas crossed over, nothin' really more to explain
And niggas can't be like me, I'm A.Z
I move inconspicously, I'm on point
And beefin' ain't a part of my style
I'm a boss, player, mastered the art of morale
Man of respect, this war when I handle the check
But behind jail walls I'm like Hannibal Lec'
Motherfuckers!




I grew up around block parties ready to rock
Behind the rope nigga with my rhymes on cock
The verse shot first nigga who had shit to pop
A bad weather blow the feathers off a hundred flocks
With 70% goose, 30 ducked, get stuck
And each link in your chain is trucked
No ends in this rhyme cipher with nine snipers
Charge of the kiss from the Pied Piper
I live around DJ's, b-boys, MC's
Through rap never thinkin' +Airways+ are TVs
It was strictly all about magnificant rhyme clout
+Rec Room+, 2 dollars with the flyer as we would doubt
Now his wigs pushed back
Name scratched off the plaque, too wild to re-enact
(Yo)


Got to check out +The W+, got to check out-- +The W+
Got to check out +The W+, got to check out-- +The W+


MC's have the right to remain silent
Everything you say can and will be used against y'all muh'fuckers
And Mef can only trust ya as far as I can see ya
Me need ya? That'll be the.. day, ya busta
It gets no rougher when, me and my comrades rush ya
Like red heat with hammers and sickles
I milk like ya baby mama's nipples, got issues
It's just us, so what's what if any can touch us
Then lord strike me down where I stand at now
Wit this bottle of Remy, gettin' fucked up child, listen
The most notable MC, ya source for hip hop quotable MC
Of course it's Tical!




The Princess, the Pope, incest, dope
Choke you by the throat, the chrome handle smoke
The man not for joke, we all out for broke
Plus the herbal that I tote, the murder that I wrote
You can't do me none, my Uzi weighs a ton
I'm comin' from the slum, Wu is number one
I stumbled on the drum, the Gods are troublesome
+Rumble+ when we come, boy you better +Run+, +Run+




Aiyo, it's like this jumpin' out of golden whips
Flashin' mega bricks, outfits, rock ridiculous whips, bitch
Wavy hair, men of the year, bent in the stairs
Sick winter gear, been on position is where
Call him an Asiatic God-body, +Longevity+
Slang rap, you get your whip wrapped
Swing through the hood calmly
Yo what up? Staten Island, Bush, George
Dust your shit off, whips spin off
Get off, slips, which, wiz
Mind di-tects mines, lines lick sick nines
Pick wines, lift up, bill a nigga six flies
Dip wide, dress my shit up, fuck six times, wish mine
Rub lamps, take thousand dollar crystalines






Tony for mayor.. (x4)


Catch me in a crisp blue six, deep dish
Jaws is Cris', valor stopped at the wrist
Watches involved, talk to me Trick Daddy
I liked the way you tilt ya hat up in that Caddy
Son, can't believe you the most slept on
Took a break since the Cuban, niggas lookin' like you just repped wrong
You done slipped down a bid, got caught with the hammer
Steal banners, medical examiners, clocked live hammers
For real, you a live nigga, rock the five in ya slippers
Like them other five guys in ya picture
Come on, watch, I'm the star of the show, so blow dem
Mothafucka, you ain't blew in three years
Son of a bitch, that's why I rock the big shit
Don't forget who you is, nigga, you my little shit
I will crush you to pieces, stop ya heart from tickin'
And you mad cuz you a older clock, couple rocks missin'
And my writin', the band, you can say it's ice flight-nin'
You don't like him, do you? You wanna fight him
In fact, I should've put you back, relaxed on the stones
And copped ya two-thousand leather shit, snow cones
A bowl of milk almost killed you, ah, you almost drowned in my Pops
I brought another box, I'mma keep it real with you
And I'mma murder you if ya bitch-ass get on my nerves again


Yo, Ghost, you'se a funny nigga
Turn on the radio, all you hear is X and Jigga
Haha, you vexed, nigga?
No airplay (bet my gat spray) Yeah, that's hearsay
You spray hairspray and up North, nigga, you ain't gettin' jailplay
(How you know?) Yo, it's obvious, clear as day


Hold on, let me park my shit, let me find out this nigga barkin' and shit
I'm a Don of this shit, and you know that shit I wrote with Golden Arms is a hit
My Wallos show off, go off like an alarm in the six
Drapped in yellow and I'm still poppin'
My movie life in the hood is like an ill doctrine
Beat trial with a legal aide, fuck Cochrane
And if it's on I might blow you if I'm boxed in.. {*echoes*}


Yo, yo, yo, what you doin', man?
Yo, man, chill out, man
(Don't even worry)
I'm just fuckin' with you, man
Why you.. (OK) Come on, son
We can't.. don't depart us like this, son
Come on (I'll destroy you)
Come on, man (You pop too much shit)
Come on, man, I'm just tellin' you time
(I ain't a-like that, you know who brought you)
Nigga, I'm just fuckin' with you
(Bye!)


Tony for mayor.. {*repeats to fade*}


Yo, let me tell y'all mothafuckas somethin'
(Shoot one of those niggas, Lord)
We could battle for belts, ice (Type shit)
Whatever the fuck you want to do
Let me tell y'all somethin'
This the Theodore Unit, mothafucka
We takin' the bait of this shit
That's word to my momma, man
(Staten Island, nigga, what, nigga?)
Coke, spoon throwers (Get ya money right)
(Gotta know how real do this)
Slew-footed mothafuckas, I pop all y'all niggas
Y'all niggas is fucked, straight up
We back in here now, mothafuckas
It's the fuckin' Unit, you heard
That's the Theodore Unit
Y'all mothafuckas better recognize
Aight? That's my word
(Yeah, nigga, yeah)

Doors is crisp, velour stop at the wrist
Watch is involved, talk to me Trick Daddy
I liked the way you tilt ya hat up in that Caddy son
Can't believe you the most slept on
Took a break since the Cuban, niggas lookin' like you just repped wrong
You done slimmed down a bit, got caught with the hammer
Steal banners, medical examiners, clocked live hammers
For real, you a live nigga, rock ya five in ya slippers
Like them other five guys in ya picture
Come on, watch, I'm the star of the show, so blow then
Mothafucka, you ain't blew in three years

And my Breitling--the band: you can say it's iced lightning
You don't like him, do you? You wanna fight him
In fact, I should've put you back, relaxed on the stones
And copped the two-thousand leather in snow cones

I bought another box, I'ma keep it real with you
And I'ma murder you if ya bitch-ass get on my nerves again


Yo, Ghost, you'se a funny nigga
Turn on the radio, all you hear is X and Jigga

Yeah whatsup. Ay-o check this out y'all this is Cilvaringz
And this ya boy Ghostface we about to pop this shit off right
That's right daddy, let the beat drop
(Straight up and down What is the total population of the original nation
Hear the wilderness of North America, and all over the planet earth daddy
{Ayo Ayo Ringz! Celebrate this nigga death date! Blow his fucking brains off!}
It's us man for real. Live from the jungle, where everything is real, guard
Your steel, hold your bitch down, pay for your motherfucking bills, rock your hat nigga!)
{All swords shall be drawn}


Yo; Straight out the iron gates of Palestines frame of thought slinging
With a rock, stayed nice with the mic pon cocked!
Pops put me on to Pac, Pac put me on to rebel shots
Devil Glocks go pop. dum-diddy-dum
I learned in school fast, how to skip the class
While my grades kept flying through the roof, cheating math
Running back to class fast, went missing, fucking teachers up
Heated up, I'm on the 12 O'clock news screaming whut!
Rapper Cilvaringz signs deals with Wu-Tang and blows
Making 2 grand a show, dum-diddi-dum
Moon and Angelo and Suei in the folio
50 Countries in the box, Amsterdam to Tokyo
I guess they never wanted me to rock and get paid
The same wage they got paid working 22 days
Bloody money makes the world spin in new ways
And 'Cuda never hit that, so that shit's on you Rae


I sat around the older Gods while they built bomb niggas up
Felt like Saddam tapping on my hand, listen up
Get your money, get brains and big niggas up
Swiss look forward to millions nigga live shit up
I sat back in my zone, bone lit, I get your throne lit
Niggas I loaned, they ain't gave me shit
Fuck that family shit, you don't see us it's for no reason
I'm in the crib, wifey saying be easy
I'm all high in my motion, money make me want to grab toasters
Spray down Wall street, put up posters
Yelling faggot I'm back, you cant take nothing from the kid
I'm still getting money I'm stacked
Go whatever for the Peso, Rap Julio Iglesio
Sniff the eight in ya face and stay lacio
My ear game, popping in my gear game, fear fame
Rearrange your jaw faster than you hear trains
Test any mortal, call 'em, I'm in the hallway hitting raw autumn
Meet me in the lobby nigga see my daughter
And she gon' spray for her dad
Call a brother later, get that money out the wall, daddy got bagged
I'm going to jail for something real, can't do me nothing, still
Can't compare me to no rap nigga, fuck a deal
I get to hurting niggas, murking on niggas
It's just the network I come from, Ringz now kid reveal 'em!


Oh no It's the Wu-Tang they're back and
Oh no Beez on the swarm attacking
Oh no Just when the world looks back and
When we speak upon the mic we speak what is right
Oh no Dollar signs won't corrupt us
Oh no And justice we shall discuss
Oh no In God and only God we trust
Newest addition to the Wu-Tang Killa Bee gang
Cilvaringz, Cilvaringz, Cilvaringz, Cilvaringz


Yeah that's right, like I told you before, this is big Ghost in effect
Yo Cilvaringz, you know how we get down nigga you killing it
We Wu'd out, wallabeed out, everything is all real just keep that shit up nigga
No doubt cause we ain't going nowhere. Cilvaringz, big Ghost in effect
We signing off nigga we out, one! (Live Moroccan Muslim, you know how it go!)




Yeah,back at it right?
In rap mode again
Ill wild dimension where
We do this to the maximum skill level
That literature gotta light shit up
The Wild...The Wild right,the jungle with no rules
We run this forest bitch,we live by the water
We eat the fruits nigga and we speak the prophets that empowers strong prophecies
King Lex.......................
This album is dedicated to the honorable Mel Carter
Rest in Palaces, kid...The Wild
That's what it is
We're tryin'a take all the fly shit
Play like this...



Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang - ONYX!!
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang - ONYX!!


Aiyyo, staircase to stage now, major waves
Tanktop Nautica, flippin your daughter thirty ways
Yeah who want mine? Bent outta shape, one time
Play the mall, starin at your bird of all sunshine
Watch my shit shift, niggas in the back, wigs lift
You know the stats God, don't even ask pa, back slit
Raw drug raps, thug hats and mob hats, spit on that cat
This yellow love nigga fuckin with a rich cat
My shit bad, 5 feet 6, with a crisp hat plush
Throwin down on thirty bricks, niggas is with that
Though, federados locked my man yo, hit lotto
Three-hundred thousand dollars in the bottle, bitch math is Heiml technique, rover in the robe, gold link
You know the code 'Rique, suitcase money, stow heat
Rock Navi's though, hundred dollar bags valet
That nigga crabbed me, gamin himself, like Milton Bradley


Yo the semi-automatic Glock this, unlock this
The weed spots get knocked, it's so hot chicks is topless
Whips are spotless, chrome rims spend obnoxious
You can't knock this, bust a shot you better not miss


X-1 wild out, and make you watch this
'til your eyes turn red with blotches, eatin scraps out the garbage
Unload a cartridge, and bust a cap
X could never trust a cat, Onyx is as hot as it gets
Bitches fuckin for free, is outta the quest'
Blow blood outta your flesh, your body outta your vest


I toss the heat from across the street
Fly you up off your feet, you die livin soft and sweet
Street crime, time is money, nigga don't waste mine
Expose my 9, throwin your shine, your froze in time
Lookin at death, holdin your breath, laid out
On the dance floor, blood and Moet, I'm blowin your set
Trick twenty G's, no sweat, your goin in debt
I'm goin for broke, I'm blowin out smoke, you catch a stroke


Wu-Tang and Baldhedz, Swiss foreheads, leave you all red
X-Milli-on, fully armed, illest beyond your realest form
Bringin the storm, forseein you warned
Nuttin keepin me calm but heat in my palm
Sleep and you gone, you see what I'm on? Creepin outta the dark
Scatter your parts from here to Battery Park


First things first man, you're {fuckin} with the worst
First things first man, you're {fuckin} with the worst
First things first man, you're {fuckin} with the worst
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on a man!


Steel master, grab half the cash fast and bash
And splash yo' class, mash your staff, WHAT?!
Nigga get smacked, you ain't worth a punch, hurt your bunch
Get murked, you front in the wrong circle punk!
Mack clever niggas dat regulate
Catch you on the d-lo in Mecca and Etch-a-Sketch ya
Shake and erase, vacatin your space, breakin your face
Straighten your waist, twist you, and won't miss you
Official Nast and Killa Bee, full blast, get off smash
Pull fast for your stash
Long as the war last, foot up in your ass
Tryin to count more math, bring in the hardcore rap


Yo; we be the mainstream
Supreme rhyme top of the line cuisine fiends
Number one love for thugs queens schemin on cream
My whole team love, the E-cup bras and mobb cars
Killa Sin known for makin niggas reach for the stars
The terrorist lyricist in the midst of the abyss
We cannabis evangelists, iron palms with metal fists
Wu build, like construction and bang, like percussion
All the Planet Battery packs combust and malfunction, what kid?

 - repeat 2X

 Holy shit!! Who the fuck is dat?
 It's John John
 Sticky Fingaz kid, you got my back?
 I got your back cousin
 I got the mack-dozen
 And when them niggas start jumpin, bust back cousin
 Cause it's a new year, time for some new shit
Nowadays rappers dyin over music
 Dead on arrival, we raised in the ghetto
Singin songs for survival, duckin homicidal, you rivals
 Yeah yeah, Onyx/Wu-Tang, on tracks we gangbang
Chitty-bang-bang
 Chitty-chitty-bang-bang
Hot Nix' spit flame, lava pump through my veins
Caught in the zone, home on the range
 Aiyyo you rang on ferocious, atrocious
We got that supercalifragalisticexpiala-
 - dope shit!
 Eight ball in the corner pocket
 We snatch wallets off the white collared
The Big Apple forever rotted
Narcotics hunt the hard target, Hot Nix'
 SO WHAT THE BUMBACLOT?!


Pop shit, we do the knowledge
To shark niggas, once bitten
Major swingers heavy hittin
Poly your kitten, throw up your mittens
Stop bitchin, no slippin, no pot to piss in
The meltin pot's boilin hot now in Hell's Kitchen


Yo, yo, Sticky Fingaz, one of the illest motherfuckers
BELIEVE DAT!! My moms don't raise no suckers
I slap rappers, turn 'em into singers
Touch somethin of mine and you'll have NINE fingaz!

 Enough said, let's paint this whole fuckin town red
 And RIP .. they whole crew to a shred!
 I got cold blood
 I pull yo' plug
 I hold, bust
 Show no love
 I'm so bugged
 Shoot yo' home up
 And shoot up the whole club
 We throw slugs


You ain't no thug!
I earned every God damn penny that I got
Son I'm rollin shotgun in the convertible
I wish a nigga W-W-W-WOULD
Try to fuckin jack me, I'll MURDER YOU!!!



Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang - ONYX!!
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang - ONYX!!






Don't take this personal
You better act like you know
In the way
Funny how everything changed
Once you got all that you wanted, nothin' was ever the same
And though
I don't need you (x4)
I still want you
I don't mean to (x4)
But I, but I love you


Six days deep, she left, she left a letter
On the stove, this how it goes, you violate the Chef
I know you was the mayor, but player I never knew
It would come to my love, oh dear, then you got numb
I'm uptown washin' the Wraith, guess who run up on me
Little strawberry, come on with this break, yo
Arguin', put your feet on my shit and bawl in me
Tears in my eyes, you dead wrong, pardon me
Faith the magical word, crack a few nerves, yo
She had integrity, expected me to swerve
But I didn't, stood right there, I know my limits
Know my ground, know my surroundin's, knowin' that I'm finished
Damn, another one lost, one more divorce
She gon' break me, it's tax time now, that's like extortion
Why me? The flyest of all who keep it irie
This is a black man's diary
Tell me why, queen


Tell me whatcha say now?
Tell me whatcha say
Come again?
If you cannot stay down
Then you do not have to pretend
Like there is no way out
I shoulda never let you in
Cause you got me face down
And don't take this personal
But you're the worst
You know what you've done to me
And although it hurts I know
I just can't keep runnin' away


I don't need you (x4)
But I want you
I don't mean to (x4)
But I love you


Tell me whatcha say now
Tell me whatcha say?
You said that you would come again
You said that we would remain friends but
You know that I do not depend on
Nothing or no one
So why would you show up
So uninvited then
Just change my mind like that
Please don't take this personal
But you ain't shit
And you weren't special
Til I made you so
You better act like you know
That I've been through worse than you
I just can't keep runnin' away




Everybody's like, he's no item
Please don't like em
He don't wife em
He one nights em
I never listen, no
I should have figured though
All that shit you was spittin', so unoriginal
But it was you, so I was with it
And tell you the truth, wish we never did it
Cause I usually do stick to the business
But you came out the blue and then you just flipped it
God damn baby, my mind's blown
I be forgettin' you live in a different time zone
I think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong
And yea I know what you did
But baby I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind, and shit
If this is real we can build
Through different types of shit
If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just






Yeah... mm-hmm, yea... yea...
Yea... (what is it lord?) yo

Fifty in gear (ten in silverware) another sixty

Seeing his case, he started spazzing
Gamma len in my only Clark, green and yellow God-God

Squeezing niggas dicks {in front of cameras}

Rick brother Pazone'll be home, estimate 30 days, brolic arm) Fresh out the cage
{Do the story seem intriging? When P come home
Will he have all these niggas mouths bleeding?}

Try to resist, reviving the rich
Airbrush money when we walk, most highly paid Cheeba hawk
Checking how he walk, tell a story lord

 (Ghostface Killah) {both}
Went down like Wednesday, Lounge gave a party at the way

(The shit look dressy) Bend up vest piece (you know how his vest be)
Lavender bird, two inch beak, parakeet
Name Unique, who knew the 1 to the 40 in a week
12 o'clock on the diz-nock, we went to check the moon out
{Vibes I'm getting, I have to clear the room out}
Took his hat off, spiral (Used to be my idol)
{Thirty inch telephone} (Lip to his eyeball)
Playing a Bob mood, just answer out his pocket
{Real heavy} (Like he bought his rings from Liberace)
Had his parrot with him, Unique, you see these niggas fronting in here?
(Yo P, they pussy, with one gun in here, the music stop)
{Bitches drop} Shit jumped off by the bathroom
{Aiyo, oh shit, that's Sasoon}
(P jumped up, grabbed his ratchet, felt sorry for him
First shot was ill, clapped his parrot)
Blew him off son shoulder, so many feathers had the club coughing
{That's when Pazone lost it!} (He wigged out, crying, spit out
He's living like Dead Presidents, real life, he's letting it out)
It was a shotty that murdered pop
Guess who did it? {The slick young bitches on the stock}

Shank doctor with choppers, rainin' on ya militants
Guns drawn, blowing out ya back ain't concealin' shit

I'm nice, targets get hit whenever I squeeze
Don status, get my dick sucked whenever I please
Above the law brick, beat cases, don't cop pleas
I buy my cars, bet y'all niggas whips be leased
I'm a wolf off the loose, somebody find his leash
I'm a star, you a Starburst sweeter than fruit
No kinda background claimed killer, then who did you shoot
Must've imagined that, with your far-fetched raps
Shit is real over here, say we blast on Satan
Take trips in and out of the country
Turn dark clouds to sunny, I'm livin' good, my paper got me comfy
You in the hood jokin' bout you wanna war with me
I get your project shot down while your land lord sleep
Now you in too deep, no turning back from your actions
You a killer then show me, if not then meet my savages
The general, I'll have my goons tear up your establishment

Can't go tilted and you just like "Ghost he killed it"
Sledgehammer, rap the whole damn Clan we built it

Pray for the healthy from alphabet cereal
I was taught to bang on niggas that's quick to talk
Moment of silence, bow ya head get it blown off
Rose, roxie and  background
Hammie still shootin' when the song's off
Wow wow like a dungeon dragon
Coaxed by a cop downstairs don't stop the baggin'
Clips hangin' like a strawberry, Charleston 
Strawberry shortcake, great lemonade and goo
Whether the projects or a drive by, bodies on the drog neck
Lightin' up the ass bettin' niggas on a side bench yeah
Stack chips like legos, pop up on you niggas like egos
Two hands on the draco
Hole in your back the size of a miniature bagel
Livewires with ya girls still suckin' our huevos
We back at it, stack habits, still servin' crack addicts
Louie baggin', we the baddest, 24 karat atlas

Rock niggas bite the head of a bird like Black Sabbath

I'm a wolf off the loose, somebody find his leash
I'm a star, you a starburst sweeter than fruit
No kinda background claimed killer, then who did you shoot
Must've imagined that, with your far-fetched raps
Shit is real over here, say we blast on Satan
Take trips in and out of the country
Turn dark clouds to sunny, I'm livin' good, my paper got me comfy
You in the hood jokin' you wanna war with me
I get your project shot down while your land lord sleep
Now you in too deep, no turning back from your actions
You a killer then show me, if not then meet my savages
The general, I'll have my goons tear up your establishment


This what it comes to, wilin' like the west and down
In this concrete jungle, homie hope you got ya vest on
And ya weapon is oil don't it jam but if it do
Leave ya crew when it's time for that warfare
This what it comes to, wilin' like the west and down
In this concrete jungle, homie hope you got ya vest on
And ya weapon is oil don't it jam but if it do
Leave ya crew when it's time for that warfare




Fuck a middleman, I can get it direct
Cook it up, watch it bubble in that pyrex
This shit hard, that's what I'm talking 'bout
This shit hard, that's what I'm talking 'bout
I could show you how to make a killing in them projects
All I need is some powder and a pyrex
This shit hard, that's what I'm talking 'bout
This shit hard, that's what I'm talking 'bout


Yeah, I'm getting fronted by the boat, waiting 'til they catapault
Raw organic blow, straight off the banana boat
Frantic when them birds landed, niggas damn near had a stroke
?? shook a can of coke
Voila as the baking soda merging
Agua, make it up bubble up like detergent
Start off soft when I whip it, work it
Come back hard like a nigga from his first bid
Yeah, this is the type of shit that hook your mayor
Marion, rich, pure, white like an Aryan
Met him at the Sheraton, reminded me of Pablo
Giving me his spiel while I inhale cigar smoke
He said I supply it through private cargo
You need to find a pilot that could fly you to Chicago
And back to the condo to come up with a plan
I met a plug, cutting out the middleman




Yeah, ?? shit smell like fish scale, cocaine
Let the water boil then I cook it on the low flame
Whipping up the whole thing with a box of Arm &
Hammer, shit coming back like karma
Pull it out the water, the icing on the cake
Let it dry, paper towels sitting on a plate
Scrape the shake out the pot, the feeling on his face
So numb that he try to tell me how it tastes
Hit the cookie with the razor, make it crumble
Nigga at the kitchen table wrapping up bundles
Caught carpel tunnel in your wrist I'll be damned
Got the whole hood looking like Zombie Land
Now I'm at the dock, directing the van back
Forklift the pallet, ripping off the saran wrap
White like anthrax, nigga met the birdman
Now I got them things transported through a ??




Ayo, the Carlos Slim of the hood
Champion hoodie, what's goodie
I'll put y'all niggas on and I'm fully
A gangsta 'til I'm gone
Been blessed with these ounces for so long
Giving niggas money for their moms
This bail paper right here is backup
I'm leaving the country, need a trillion on my arm to live comfy
Back up, my spots is like leopards
I come through with shepherds
Shoulder strap on, black Louis black bombers
Yeah the police is scared and it's weird
400 thousand, take them there
You know it's all of us, one crack you can't even spam
I'm not doing jail for racketeering

We get it in, we want RBC money
Ready with black crack, running back to the crib, they coming






Yo, send all the workers up to five b man, you know what time it is man
Niggas did good this week man, let's celebrate


Bottles of crew, bagging in the living room, high noon
Couple rachets, snares, the razors and earmuffs
Walking joints, chirping niggas downstairs in the lobby converting
There's something next to live wires and goons
All in the sets hundreds to thousands, thousands to ms
Then tackle up the rims store, go and buy timbs
Hit the Popeyes, cops got eyes
We breezing through with nothing but fives
Puffing herb, we gon let the sun rise
They don't know niggas is slingering, what's the lingering?
Niggas ain't fiends, $400 jeans, cooling like it's England
Rather see me role in a hole, rocking state jeans and sneakers
Square sandwhich, juices and peaches
Not right now dick, this is our valve, we get down dick
None of that clown shit, we built it from a thou
See straight watchers, my niggas sleep, all of my unique poppers
Legends from the eighties came home, we got em eating poppers
Take money, eating steaks, being rude, feeding snakes
This is what get us all the planes and the eights
This is my land like Thailand, why?
Cuz I control it and I own it, But some say it's FBI land


Now just gimme that, don't make me take that
The minute I'm finished with it, I go straight back
Re up and reload, keep up my workload
Homeboy this block is mine cuz I say so (what)


Violation of the RICO Statute to cash rules
Cocaine is a hell of a drug, the fortune of intelligent thugs
We the ones that they write movies about
Beautiful pounds, got the best doobies in town
Shoot it the fuck out, wash money, wash the blood off of Benjamin's face
Defenders of the faith, measure the weight
Forever by itself, reaping pleasure from pain
We the best in the game, hit you in the chest and the brain
I move weight homie and expand like Scarface
Leave you hanging from the chopper like Omar Suarez
Ill Bill, suicidal live ayatollah, keeps it liver than al-Qaeda soldiers
Sign in the name of Allah Jehovah
Portable wars, the blowjobs never stop
Freak bitches won't stop, sniffin' till their nose pop
Nose candy enthusiast
Bitches able to swallow an entire one liter bottle, abuser shit
We super gangsta, accurately cruising for bangers
Ya'll in the womb rappers, happily remove you with hangers
We move like a federation of terror
Put you under the dirt, cus ain't no room in this equation for error






Yeah, pass the purpleish shit, man
Lex Diamond, hit that, hit that, hit that
Word up, this for my son, right here

Baby boy, 2004 shit, nigga, just forget it


Aiyo, I run every coast that I ran, I do a real nigga move
Make the young niggas show me a plan
Guaranteed make all of them stand, like a hundred thousand
And better, the sweater that I rock is a grand
When you see me coming through your yard
I play the hood, with a real look, steel on my leg, in a van
Kill niggas, pop they mans, stop they plans
Why, cuz Ice Water got it popping, that's fam
We take it from here to here, anybody violate the system
That's my word, a nigga gon' hear
We rep Staten, plus all of the Latins in Los Angeles
And bad cracks up and hit Manhattan
Take it to a new level, all of us, Maybach bikes
Hit the circle, come through looking special
Shout out the team, yo Agony, you and your dogs
Keep them things on cocked and splash on 'em


A thousand words to a picture
Will paint your reflection in a mirror
So you can see the trigger side clearer
West Coast, Cuban Link, down to my knees
With the best scope, weed to smoke, back on the street


We the ones that you running from
The ones pulling guns from under the polo knitted and make you fitted
Not finished, the real Chace Infinite, a passionate lyricist
Most rappers I hate, this nigga Rae was an influence
To build an indistructable frame, I excel, but entertain
I wish a nigga would, say my name, wish a nigga would play those games
Strong Arm Steady Gang, the illest niggas on the mic from L.A
Phil burn a bag of the haze, and I'm having visions of CREAM airs
With the blue light, Marvin Gaye dripping
Chace is a visual spectacle, and see the raw clear through my cardiere
Spectacle frames, type of nigga that'll twist my slang
With double meaning like, nigga I'mma about my chance
If you get it, then we kicking the same
I'm a poet, that paint black & white pictures in a colorful frame




Aiyo, back like I never left, rap like I'm back with the rest
Yup, with all of my niggas, right on the steps
Cinematic view for the listeners, who paint pictures
Write scriptures, flip it on radio transisters
Listen up, get your bonds up, as far as us, we stay up to speed
Buckling up, whose fucking with us?
Immobilize your enterprise, stabilize all of your guys
Prepare yourself for two thousand and five
Live since '95, surviving, what we striving for, y'all
We got our families to feed plus we need more ends
They depending on us, the government is taxing us up
They see that I'm black, they want me in cuffs
Enough to make your nigga fall back, analyze
We on the front line, getting the good, keep the hood in mind
Design like, one of the best, architechts, building the net
Tell 'em some shit, you'll never forget




"Strong Arm"
	"Steady muthafucka"
"Strong Arm, Strong Arm"
	"The shit that I'm repping is steady"
"Y'all not ready"




We run the city


Today's agenda, got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest, if no money exchanges
I got these kids in Ranges, to leave them niggas brainless
All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo' killings clean, slugs up in between
They eyes, like "True Lies," kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin with put bombs in your mom's gas tank

Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear them all out
Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch, I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fuckin real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five apiece (uh-huh)
Enough to cop a six; buy the house on the beach (uh-huh)
Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody gettin cream no one considered them leech
Think about it now that's damn near one-point-five
I kill 'em all I'll be set for life

Frank pay attention
These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob 'em

I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed


Niggas got to die, if I go they got to go
Niggas got to die, let a hundred shots float
Niggas got to die, cause it's all up in the scrolls
Catch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid
... if I go they got to go
Niggas got to die, let a hundred shots float
Niggas got to die, cause it's all up in the scrolls
Catch a body on the bridge, three bricks, live kid


We up in the lab, two Spanish, one Arab lady
Layin on the bed, lookin like a drag
Had the pillow cuffed, lookin at me and Frank, her grill was rough
Who woulda ever think she'd rather do us up
But that's the business, back to the sitch
On these Puerto Rican kids with pistols
Doin sign language is twitchin noses
Ask 'em where the money at, yo where the coke at papi?
We can do this all day, yo y'all both whack
They pulled out, one of my dunn soldiers was wombed out
They snuck up on him, put the tool up in his mouth
Walked them up in crib, big move, but they grabbed the kid
Had the shotty on my beehive, my wig
And yo they took me to the bathroom, started up the chainsaw yo
You gon' talk or see your brains on the floor
That's when 6 to 7 masked men, came in blastin yo
All I heard was Frank, "Lexi get the raw!




Bleed just like us, believe my pipe bust
If he holdin the right amount of cheese I might rush the spot
Up early in the mornin, kick the door in, wave the 4 an'
(fuck) the brawlin, cause Tony for the stallin
And all I see is dollar signs, here's the bottom line either
Give up the product or get shot up with a brolic 9
Invest figures to address (niggas)
Workin out, all I curl is my index finger
Got a safe that hold more notes than Cortex singers
My work is move trays, serve 'em up like gourmet dinners
When it comes to cuttin that (coke), who got the best trimmers
Edward Scissorhands them grams, (niggas) respect winners
I got them big spenders comin through, hourly
Competition, we knock 'em out the box, powerfully
Still drop a ill verse, on the D.I., me
You might be gone, but the legacy is B.I.G., nigga
Uh-huh


Yo I think they tryin to do somethin man
I don't know what it is but we gon' go in there handle this business man
Straight up, y'knahmean?
It's goin down...
Let's go handle this man...






King Push
RZA
Razor
Execution


The devil is a lie
You ain't broke bread 'till you taste the devil's pie
They say his laugh sounds like an angel when he cries
What better camouflage when the halo's your disguise
Them wings don't fly
Your traitor is your neighbor
At your front porch, and he's handing you your paper
Bathrobe on, but the sword's underneath
And he wanna see your blood as it pours in the street
It's the mark of the beast
The meek shall inherit the Earth
The weak shall inherit the dirt
You each should have perished at birth
Still born or aborted
Every street tax gotta come with an audit
Either your life, or your loved ones
Straight razor or a snub-gun
From the village where the thugs from
Same corner that you copping all your drugs from
He a hero, but he unsung
I'm the one


Ayo homie, the chambers is 36, they new and improved
Now make a move
These guns whistle, sizzle up dudes who got big mouths, no power
Run in the bank with no dollars, got the nerve to switch crews
We better than the rest of 'em, my guess is the estrogen
And all the money we got, we move like the Mexicans
A cartel, compound, a carvel, a large scale in Scarsdale
I fuck with golf now, Shala is ill
Yeah, the coke is fresh, straight out of Bermuda yo
Or chilling on a beach in Boca Chica with tuna
Salads and palaces, yo, we smoke out them chalices
Passing of the balances of bread to the Island since
1984, the blow was just more
Then we would come trough with rifles rocking Nike boots and war
A real nigga's invention that came from a henchman
Who blew up, now throw the Wu up, that's my redemption


Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
You niggas talking, but you ain't never seen 'em
Imagine being first name basis with the kingpin


God, I was Lucifer's neighbor
You wouldn't believe some of the things these people do for this paper
Moving with the lasers under Rugers
Make a move, you make the papers, lose lose situation
Sweat or blood, you get to choose what you bathe in
The chemists cookwork
The runners; footwork
The custies took work
The soldiers put work in
On any of the motherfuckers who fucked up good work
Bosses tell 'em: 'Good work'
That's just how the hood work
Northface bubble with, eight bundles under it
Gold front upper-lip smile while I was hugging it
I lied, I wasn't Lucifer's neighbor, he who I'm fucking with
My moms threw that snow in her nose, but I would hustle it
Champ hoodie, Mongoose with the pegs
Clap your stoop up, hit moms duke in her legs
That's beef nigga, y'all ain't street niggas
Y'all peep niggas, write it down and try to be niggas
Fucking everything, neck heavy swing
Second hand swepped across that pretty Breitling
In that Nissan, Honda, Chevy thing peddling
Whatever bring 'fetti in, steadily I fed my whole team




In this art of war, my pen stroke is Picasso
Niggas get the picture I ain't got to paint the nostrils
You know my origins is over when
Fat black bitch singing over organs
Die for a dollar, pride you don't swallow
You save that for the one you buying red bottoms
Yuugh! That's the price you gotta pay for it
All's fair in love and war, she masquerade for it
Woo! Jack-O-Lantern Push
Trick or treat, fuck your shit, I earned it off the books
Now listen to me vent
When you sitting watch, it's like the tires being spent
Shots from everywhere, but they never make a dent
Knight in shining armor
Mistake me for the villain cause my vengeance is your karma
Yeah, fear is knowing you're a goner
This music to my soul, cause it's death before dishonor
Gone


Check!
Got the tongue of a pimp, raised by a dirty preacher
That used the church money to cop a new Beamer
Got the heart of a child raised by a prostitute
That bought his momma the rubbers when a John came through
Its the microphone Methadone
Greatest ever etched in stone
You aint getting pussy like your prom date had a chaperone
Popping pills got a nigga brain like a labyrinth
Called the ho on purpose but I got the brain on accident
Nigga Im your majesty, show up with a bag of weed
Rolled a blunt so perfect, thought it came up out a factory
My manuscript leave a man ripped of all his dreams
The insomniac with nightmares in sixteens
Im a wet dream, dry sense of humor
Travel in class like a high school rumor
No one really cares if you embarrass us with style
Cause when it comes to them raps you been letting us down
So tell em why you're mad son
Gotta get it off your chest
Let em know how you feel son
You gotta say what you say
It dont matter, they gonna say a nigga hating anyway




D-Block! I ain't Cam, but it's muthafucking Killa Season
Homey's dying over ignorant nigga reasons
Know the home fried, lotta egos
Hoodrat bitch that be digging a nigga steelo
Hood got kilos, making them niggas evil
Gotta bring guns to the court, when they B-Ball
I don't play around with them suckers, I'm a G, ya'll
Standing on the tip of the block, I'mma see ya'll
Wanna know the price of a verse, I got the fee, ya'll
I tell you how much, coming through like the army do
Army suits, all big coupes with Armani suits
I got the lows on, and the toast on
Me, two guns and a knife, form Voltron
Oatmeal, PBJ, getting my bulk on
Sacrificing most of you rappers, getting my coke on
Electrifying all of you niggas, getting my votes on


Aiyo, yo, from every palace in the hood
To every child that's in the hood, it ain't no deers around here
But it's all good, my metal niggas, forever rebel niggas
Never ever rebel, just only time telling niggas
Wake up 'fore niggas eat you
It's only matter of time, when them nines come out to meet you
Yo, don't be alone when we roaming, like cell phones, homey
Cuz when they hungry, it's another story, run for me


I'm back like retro kicks, and I'm saucy
Your brain can get left on some pesto shit
I need a Pablo Esco' flip, and I'm the Phantom
Listen real close, you hear the echos spit
I'm a wolf, you run around on some gecko shit
Kick in the door of the shit, wasn't left for bent
I kill the best now, tell me who the rest gon' get
Not a damn one, the handgun, is right on the waist
Whether you ugly or you handsome, I'm right in your face
You can run, I get excited from the flight of the chase
Little chimp, why don't you try to spend a night with the apes
I get higher than the flight outerspace, where I'm from
I seen alotta niggas die or get indicted for base
Get weight, a little cake try to buy them a place
Either raw, ain't safes on, firing eight
And mine, nigga, I don't fire 'em straight, feel me






Let's take it to the top like a escalator
To touch me, you need a elevator
Black mob, my team strong, my style greater
Smooth criminal, white linen on yellow gaiters
Started with a dream to make it to a key
Now, we hoppin' outta cars that never use a key
Came out hard off credit cards and open schemes
Now, it's women who make a livin' right on their knees
All them nights, prayed a night for better days
Feelin' like Biggie in them Versace Shades
Vegas lights, sparkles bright, I got a wave
Feelin' right, bitches nice, I can't behave
Chillin' in Miami with my Cuban piece
She won't let me leave, grabbing on my Cuban linen
Pop Models, pop mollies in large dose
Pack light, pack hammers at them Award Shows


Smoke screen, cooler than them boats, sellin' choke, jump out, the whole world know us
I'm only rich, floating
Real Deal Bentley, niggas
Feel them heaters, we them Beatles
Pull out on family members, snaking leaders
Quarter-Million shit on the stove
Got some real Brooklyn killer-stack niggas with me
Spit on your globe
Got my Lawyer in the back of the foyer
Eatin' sauted fish, pass the goya
My gun named Toya
Marble Floors in the Benz
The rims is regular
Come through, new lots ?
Adorned with a sword in his leather
And I've been on the walls
In Ossining. And bring it back
The best and my cleaver came with me
Yo, King with me, reload quickly
I'm surely down fifty a cheeba, elloquently
I relax in the Waldorf
Under the covers, and the sword off
Sweat this shit, growing a mohawk
Ready to blow off




Hahahaha... ahhhh, do it nigga, there, you should fucking...
Fucked up New York Yankee hats on fronting
Niggas know Cuban Linx when they hear it nigga
Huh... I'm the muthafucking Ali of the game, bitch


When I sat back and crafted Cuban, it was a classic
When you told me you had giant beef, we brought the hatchet
What it is niggas, gangstas that live in the grizz'
Play the kitchen, coke bagging, this the life that we is
What it is, daddy, slow heart stepping, plus repping
Blinging necking, our fucking regime, protect it
That's right faggots, turning into actresses
Niggas is soft, wack, and broke, what packages?
Yeah, yeah-yeah, call it how I see it, this is all metamorphic
Awkard, walk with the four-fifth
This is all crack money, cli-clack, move back homey
You will get a quick slap, we rap, not now money
What up, what up, peace, incarcerated scarfaces
Stay on the end, with dip dodge, play the yard chasing
Paper, this is like everyday street caper
Me flying offa ya face, yo, you can eat later


We the treasurers of getting cake, big jewelry swinging
Wth the long chains on, my nigga, you know we heavyweights
Feds latch on us, we catch amnesias
We rich, stay clean, looking, rocking dark caesers


Nigga Chef back, wood back, he in the good Ac'
What's hood, me in your hood, we got the good crack
Don't violate me, I hate, I'm like Star and Buc

Don't even move duke, take off your shoes
We hardbody action packed, keep a baboon
The jewels is back, with strappers on, come take it
Shoebox with nothing but hash, alotta old ass
Wallies is off the meat rack, splash

Word up, yo call up the jet, call up the dread, man
Word up, man...

"Smoking" "Drinking" (2x)

And got the nerve, yo, to look like Grady, God
They threw the brown paper bag on his face, and Jail went crazy
Blamin' 'em, yo he was gettin' tortured
He had white niggas pissin' and shit, he left sores on 'em
Wow, what up with Maui, Maui chillin'
He in the fed joint, cousin got knocked, I heard he got millions
Tourin' with Yukon Gold, yo, they out in Europe
With the new accent, that shit is grown
Northern got his Lights sprayed out
He out in Texas, with some ugly ass African niggas, they blew his pipes out


Weed, niggas fiend for me, smokin' my leaves
I'm like weed, can't stand niggas touchin' my seeds
I'm like weed, keep sellin' me to crooks and thieves
I'm like weed, all the young niggas callin' me trees

"Smoking" "Drinking" (2x)


Went in the stash, grabbed Hash and 'em
He had a forty pound nigga named Brown, they poured gas on him
Yeah, yo, the crib got raided, God, Challish was there
He got tangled up, caught him and beared
Yo, under the pillow, White Widow, yo
She went to crack school, never came back, I heard she look old

Sleepin' in quesadias, Blueberry rollin' 'em

Yo, I got to blow, I'm embarrased
They threw Crystal Palace kid off the roof, with T.H.C.'s madness



Weed (4x)




I made my own moves






What y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
This '97
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to '79


I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultraviolet shine blind forensics
I inspect you, through the future see millennium
Killer Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets, Queen Bees ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block


As the world turns, I spread like germ
Bless the globe with the pestilence
The hard-headed never learn
This my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life standing firm
On foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
Transform into the Ghost Rider
A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire
Who got my back in the line of fire holding back?
What? My peoples if you with me, where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
What the blood clot? We smoke pot and blow spots
You want to think twice? I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums


I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
Vocabulary 'Donna talking, tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what? Run for your brother kid
Run for your team and your "six can't rhyme" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme, your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts, paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought
I got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God


The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang


Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape Hell globe spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anaesthesias
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings


March of the wooden soldiers, C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square we stay in gold like Flair
Escape from your dragon's lair
In particular my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat bass lines on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck, I'm ducking five-year probation


War of the masses, the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song


The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none


Yo Yo Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink, you had a Navy green
Salamander fiend, bitches overheard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cork-pop convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese, is that so?
Ceaser needs the greens, it's Earth
Ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz


Aiyo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer, Blue-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor world tranquilizer
Adjust the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening
Guaranteed made 'em jump like Rod Strickland




Pull out the red carpet, faggot, rap, I live it, mass digits
Monkey suit, swinging on a dime jean chunky blue
All nines Al Qade it, paid up, play it up
We demonstate death, then kill you in the stadium
Yankee suits on, the boots on, produce juices
Spill rugers on you, play the deuce, them boosters on you
I'm stealing, everything, diggin' whitey righty
With the magnum taught, when you shoot it, nigga, grab 'em
It's the Roc For Life Familia, slash, The Vatican
Pop cabbages, it's nothing, nigga, kidnap ya managers
Fly roller, slang ox holders and cock blowers
The Cuban 2's is coming, ya'll niggas is done in
Ya'll niggas is fronting, my niggas is stumping
Cuz when ya'll wanna get it on, Rae's up and
It's something, those are stunting, can't do me nothing
I'll take ya bitch, baby boy, then you fuck up in






Weve just received a report that New York City is under attack by swarms of killer bees. Theyve been seen approaching from Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. We urge you to stay in your homes at this time, as we will be bringing you up-to-the-minute information. This just in: Police are reporting that theres a man on top of a skyscraper, ready to jump. Im told that he is possibly Ol Dirty, a member of the Wu-Tang Clan. The police suspect that there could be some connection between this old dirty man, and the killer bees


What y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
This '97
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to '79


I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits tremendous
Ultraviolet shine blind forensics
I inspect you, through the future see millennium
Killer Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets, Queen Bees ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block


As the world turns, I spread like germ
Bless the globe with the pestilence
The hard-headed never learn
This my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life standing firm
On foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
Transform into the Ghost Rider
A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire
Who got my back in the line of fire holding back?
What? My peoples if you with me, where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
What the blood clot? We smoke pot and blow spots
You want to think twice? I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums


I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
Vocabulary 'Donna talking, tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what? Run for your brother kid
Run for your team and your "six can't rhyme" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme
Your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts
Paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought, I got the fashion
Catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God


The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang


Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape Hell globe spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anaesthesias
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings


March of the wooden soldiers
C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us

Yo, yo yo; fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack

Forreal? Can I get a juice, lord?
Yeah, yeah... yeah, squad niggas boy, forreal
Uh-huh, forreal, man, word, open the door, man
Hustle flow shit, yeah, aiyo, pass the cigar, lord
Come on, man, stop playing, man


We in the cabin playing backgammon, gorilla monster slammers
Brothers hire us, try us you gon' die, son
Green medicine, blow veterans
Run in Adidas store, six more velours, drawers feather skin
Haircutted up, hollering, seven through three sixes
No, we ain't the devil, where ya llama, dick?
Can't stand the other side, niggas know we rich, we color guys
Loose up your mother, true lullabies
Gangsta ever readies, take off my shirt, no batteries, nigga
Just one mean magnum killer
Snowmobiles jetting out the Timber, feel Chef altitude
Yo, I can't breathe, check the splendor
Brazilian honey dip, I'm on my rifle day, nigga
Times is roughing, Timberland cuffing
One knee up, G up all the re-up
Hope we can pull it back, my throat my only weapon, blow the beat up


Stuff Brillo pads in the rat holes, reduce that faggot ass nigga
Who wanna jump like a frog to a tadpole
Gag it up, sliding through the ER, batted up
A tube in your dick, you can't piss when standing up
Hands is shaking, doctors is taken to operating
"Nah, he might not live!" So they start debating
You in bad shape, in the neck of New York
Your slithering ways, lay with you a bad snake
Smash bake, eight stab holes in your shoulder blades
You wilding on the stretcher and shit, they trynna hold your legs
Nah don't hold his legs, tell that bitch ass nigga to chill
Put something in his meat like bolognese
Got gophers that sleep in the woods, Carhartt down
Padlock your bow-legged spot, where your rocks now?
You ain't moving no crack, you'se a moving ass rat
After you lay up in that morgue, I'mma fuck your back
Yeah, nigga, die slow with your smirk on
Night-night lights, dim it down, get your mirk on
Later I see you in hell, get your burn on
Filled with embalming fluid, get your sherm on


My sherm on in the hood when I ride by
My eyes looking like I learned how to skydive
The world is yours, there's rules you abide by
Ride with the fly guy on I-95
They said a nigga return, but I never left
I told Big L through me, he could resurrect
I'm that nigga like Puff in L-O-X
I took one L and life is still Double X
Brick City where I breathe all the trees at
The E's in M&M's, I need a Relapse
And bitches, grab my mic, give me feedback
Reggie you an asshole, baby I be that
Yeah, I get cocky when the beat pumping
You know you doing it when your tire lip running
I keep a freak and I call her chicken McNugget
Cuz this Superbad nigga, she McLovin'


Fiends get killed in my hallways, we parlay
My feet been killing me all day
Your boy down for lot, like them killas in RahWay
It's all work and no play, cuz this block ain't nothing like Broadway
Revenge is sweeter than sorbet, you all become believers
Once this heaters in your face, just a part of my feng shui
Ya'll don't want no part of the gun spray
I would hate to pull it and one stray
That's where the innocents by stand, we trapped inside these tenements like damn
Why mama trynna feed us this spiced ham
Connects trynna cheat us with light grams
Co-defendants try to lighten they sentence, snitching to white man
Turned state evidence, fam, we ain't jellin'
Felons ain't felons no more, they straight tellin'
Ain't nothing worse than a rat, you can't smellin'
And ain't nothing worse than a trap you can't sell in



 x2
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin wit nobody
Fuck around and I'm a catch a body


Try me, try me, I'ma pull that flame out and start firin'
Lightin' up the cheeba, schemin' on a robbery
We gon' hit your label up, they yellin' bribery
A posse like the Isleys, the Isleys
Posin' in Ferragamo, need some Visine
All us got machetes, poke you with the Yao Ming
17 holes in your Polo 
Stylin' since the '90s, the '90s
Shoutin' out Japan, biggin' up my Chinese
2 S Benz's flyin', those are Siamese
Burner in the bag, Gucci sneakers lime green
Don't you ever rhyme, B, no you're not me
Blowin' heavy broccoli, my sport is hockey
Yeah we fuck bad bitches, whores jock me
Flyin' in a Porsche, doors, oh stop beefin'






Money like Floyd, and swagger like Puff
That's what's up
You fuck with them big girls? yup
Had ghostface "all i got is you" on
I knew i had to move on
This light, red-bone bitch, it grew on me
I know you're rich, few kids, live in the cliffs
All i see is fly gear, and hourly spiffs
Thats what it is
Clean brim, louies was thin
Glasses on, she mastered niggas, 
At the crib, i'm at  cooking
Then came the neglige, Rae stop looking
Left on the stove yo, came over, slammer was rock
She threw it in her mouth, good looking out
Chill for a sec, my real boo, yo, smooth as a 
That's why i buy her more shit, 
This my nigga, long time gangsta



You don't have to lie to me
You can cry to me
You're the only one i let see this side of me
So give me your heart
This is my promise
For you
Ask what i'll be when i'm older


And i'll be your man
And you'll be my woman
And you'll understand
We could be open


You can cry to me
When we're making love
You can cry to me
Girl, if it's too much


You don't have to hide from me
I know its frightening
It's clear as day, but it still feels like night to me
So give me your heart
Baby, i'll light it
For you
Ask what you'll see when it's over


And you'll see a man
And i'll see my woman
You'll understand
We could be open


You can cry to me
When we're making love
You can cry to me
Girl, if it's too much




Sooner or later some shit like this was bound to happen
Witness the sound of a classic
Like Enter The Dragon, found yourself drown in acid
Each and every time my sounds is blasting
Breaking beat makers down to fractions
You play around with matches
Surrounded with gas from folks you hang around
But that's just smoke up your clown asses
Funny how cats just, throw they weight around bragging
Talking a mound of trash but found trapped in my basement
Bound and gagged and now who's laughing?
Get down ya bastards
Cow Tao bow to the master
Powerful tracks and rapping; how 'bout that shit?
Y'all 'bout to eat the gun neat like a pound of chapstick
Track wizard, powerful magic
Cast a spell, you cats out looking sorry like Ms. Jackson
My efforts is deffer than a closed caption backspin
The rhythm make equivalent of Chow Yun-Fat with two gats blasting

 {x2}
Everyone knowing that butcher's on the beat, yo
(You know who it is)
"Ya nahmean?"
"Chops, the butcher baby, magnificent" - Mountain Brothers 'Birds Of Paradise"
"Chops burn the house down" - Mountain Brothers 'Opin Wide'


My beats rhymes and bars is all I have left
Without or with a group, grandmaster of badness
House of Ill Repute, Landcaster Ave, the address
Grab the mic and wear it out like a hoe's mattress
I spit just the facts like Dragnet
Attract fans like a magnet
Use your head for something else beside a hat rest
You know them faces the crowd is making
From the nasty rhymes you thought you was kicking; that was bad breath
Mad heads wanna bring drama than cable access
Just some local cats that's dummies
Getting ready to feel hurt like a crash test
Be sweating more than a porno actress that's...taking a math test
You ain't paid no dues, got some bad debts, writing bad checks
To video tricks to flash flesh
To cover the fact that you express wackness
Just a bunch of Shallow Hal's can't see my phatness like...




Dedicated to heads I looked out for and ain't did shit for me
It's all good cause I got a master plan like Mister Cee
'Bout to savor the taste of victory
While y'all separated like six degrees
It ain't sweet like Crispy Creme
Meanwhile the whole industry fienda be hit by me
Anticipate the buzz like when you twist the tree
Cause this will be be
The moment where the rubber hits the street
Because my shit's complete
Chops be spitting heat over top of the sickest beats
Heads bobbing instinctively
And every city know my mix is mean
Bass and snares, hats, kicks crisp and clean
Still you ask the kid will I spit sixteen?
It's a mystery
See I might get all in your mouth like Listerine
Make the house rip at the seams
Whole crowd shit they jeans
Right before I be out and split the scene
Or I might chill and not say shit like Mr. Bean






Word up, unc's is a live nigga
Hey, Uncle, uncle! What up baby?
Yeah, yeah, I need a pair of kicks, pa
Hold me down, man, for real, for real, for real
Love you to death, nigga
Word up, word up, uncle, uncle, uncle
Yeah, fuck them niggas, homey


For years, he had the coast's on lock
Jamaicans make bread, Cubans call him pop
Was a young O.G., considerate, fly gangsta anxious
His face is rude, that made him more dangerous
Went suddenly blind, he couldn't see faces
He rock glaciers, well known in strange places
Been killin' niggas, all ages
Paid his way up out of court cases, extortin mazes
Love stay greens, livin' in Queens
Cousin named Dahoom, who you, nigga I'm Team
Dressed real ill proper, when he locked up
Playin' the wall, one foot up, what, the kid was into soccer
Love family, nigga in Miami, right, Air Force's on
Four horses smokin' on china white, they bad
He had the Shaft look, and then he yell Rae
He had cribs hooked, he had nasty books
Him and his right hand, worth a hundred in the can
Little short Dominican, little Duran was fam
Eyes bloody, pop Vasine and he studied
Gave rides to me, dropped me and Old Earth in Brooklyn
I mean Brook-lan, a super crook don off the hook
He had the juks look, and he loves Benzes and gongs
Get wands, daddy, Yukon, grow up get on's daddy
Be sure, watch for, eat all that, daddy
Yeah, young'n's, supposed to marry
Don't play me close, kept the loot in his boats, he threw the toast at me
I wanted to be with him badly
Had me like a little nigga, runnin' with wolves, they all glow gladly
Heavenly, now he seventy, got rich representin' me
He won't throw me no cash, play pool, baby
I be like, ooh, no you didn't, baby, get drunk money
You'se a slick dude, baby, slip through, baby
Yeah, I'm on, makin' records now, I be gettin' money after you gone
He's a Don, slick Juan, Marijuan', Don Juan
Eatin' Caribbean food, feedin' me wrong
Breathe from the tongue, Chef you live
Make these niggas realize you gon' be number one


He's a high roller, he's a shot caller
He's a slick talker, he's a big baller
(Wise words he spoke to me, look how it's suppose to be)






Let's get a little... little drawing going on, yeah, that's what it is man
Word up, A$AP Rocky, what up, my nigga? Young King right there
Yeah, I see you, nigga, it's your big brother Chef right here, man
Raekwon, nigga, you know, we got you all day, nigga
I know you got your big brother all day, too, you know, it's all real


At the dice game, on sleeze mode, gun in the road
But count hundreds, sit back my home on my stomach
Who the king boo, eating grapes, send me to 50 states
I pump everywhere I go, I thump plenty spaces
Either Im in the slums, counting up ones
Shaking down fiends, hopping to the most and one
Besides bagging up, new ratchets
Always in hatchets nigga, the fly bachelor with all those classics
My gun is red eyeball brown, run the town
Black hoodie sweats, no jewels a coupe with some specs
Matching in the million dollar mansion with brans
And its always love love, just bring your advancing
Bottles from everywhere, hoes run up
Niggas in tennis wear Im finish the menace, get 'em, yeah
Yo, we in the cut dogs on them
Stay cocky, peace is real, yo, Rocky!


King of New York with these underground killas
Ride, ride, nigga fuck the niggas, nigga


My uncle Snoop told me keep the biscuit on me
Said they got the scoop on me and they listen on me
Plus my bougie-ass neighbors keep the bitching on me
And the nosy bitch next door call the district on me
And they snitching on me, self-esteem went missing on me
Chip off my shoulder, you can get it off me
But these bitches on me, the other *censored* got a prison story
That Mr. Greedy's just a missing story
Listen wardy, I was on them bitches, pitching sipping, 40's
Mauri kicks and Norreys bitches, all these shorties kissing shorties
Keep division brody, cold world, keep your mittens wordy
Go hard but you kill 'em softly
Pay attention shorty, wonder why I call your bitch a shorty?
It's the way of the world, don't be tripping shorty
Just get your picking shorty, hold your own, keep it pimping brody
Same shit, just a different story


King of New York with these underground killas
Ride, ride, nigga fuck the niggas, nigga


King of New York in my hood we blow up houses
Grenades look like quarter waters sitting on the counter
Silence all you will encounter if you talking 'bout you 'bout it
Thugging noise heating salad, gripping the banger give me callus
Like Pops from the Wayans when I fire
Switching lanes in the Porsche, gotta catch up to my tires
Got cannons like Mariah, goddamn it my Messiah
He done ran into some violence, put him to rest in his pajamas
Twin clips, Pusha T, thats for talking all that malice
In your bitch, I'm a sneaker, she gon' need some new balance
Got Franklins like Aretha, see my money that be piling
And my shiny gold teeth, you can see my money smiling


King of New York with these underground killas
Ride, ride, nigga fuck the niggas, nigga




Yo.. yeah
Don't erase none of that good shit in the beginnin
Yo.. spill drinks on ya, get stank on ya
Yo.. yo.. pinky ring shit, yo
That pinky ring shit, yo


It's that pinky ring shit, the legend of masked kid
Shoot out the speakers when my guns get jurassic
Superbad, who am I? Dolemite classic
The vandal's back, hands on Angela Bassett
I handle my plastic, gunplay I mastered
No coke, dope mixed down with acid on record
Broken down and crafted in seconds
Lady's choice, the golden voice still peppered
Better, respect it, bitch believe
I pull rabbits out the hat, tricks up my sleeves
I air out the showroom, the shit can breathe
Fix your weave, behold my expertise


I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back
I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back


Take it back to the peoples, leanin' gettin' rec room punch
We in them authentic alley switchin joints
Major general niggas, five stars
Both arms rock when coke dropped we read a hundred niggas palms
Silencers, garbage bags of hash
For every cop we paid retired now the nigga on smash
Gash you out your burner fast
You swing down hatin me now respect get your fingers off the glass




Yo what the fuck yo?! Yo what the fuck y'all comin for?
Get the fuck away from my door!
We got big guns in here, coke over there
With blue bag and E pills stashed under the chair
And there's Boss Hog black and white pit with the pink lips
Stan thought he was soft 'til he bit his fingers
The shit had me dyin yo, big fat nigga bleedin
Big cat nigga all season
On the beach truck, stuck with Hawaiian ice
Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought FUBU
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
18 karat rap between noodles




Up at Killa Bee headquarters, four whips just pulled up
I saw Johnny sippin Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin off the hip
I sit took three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead king, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ".. Any Means Necessary"


John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all get shot


New York, New York, legendary rhyme boss
Code name Charlie Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
You crash-tests can't measure the threat
I dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah
Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin, feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself
The Noble, Sir I mass mogul
Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals


This is grown man talkin, coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect father Eton with Addies
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see


From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets




{*scratching "Suuuuuuuue" until fade*}




Whattup gangstas, come on, come on
This is teflon right here, poisonous fly shit
Poltergeist back, add on nigga, live
What's the vertigo? Yo, aiyo, aiyo, aiyo


Chilling in the sneaker store, guess who walked in
Aretha, lord, Reebok queen, sneaker broad
Yo what up chick? Pussy dynamic, deeper than Titanic
Fly Hispanic, banded
Had me mapped out, iceberg down, saw the six
Then she broke wild, scopin' how the bitch get down
What up, I like that, give 'em regards
Sendin' messages to Gerard, who look like W.D. Faraud
Peace, how you be love, checkin' my feet like she seen Lugz
Ring gleamin' all on her mug
What up, wise guys, start laughin', pullin' outta pocket Platinum
Hand platinum, I stop laughin'
Rich niggas fuckin' had, figured it out
I won't fuck with her, warm blood, suck these nuts
Yeah, I'm out, spendin' off in a Benz truck
Valor look, richer than a fuck, what, wavy haircut
Met me at the light, wildin', made a right
Shorty violent in the boat, half smilin', with a gallon, aight?
Plus the queen of the tree head, pullin' over like a bean head
Fiendin' like a demon with green dreads
Jumped out, parked it, booth sparked it
Where your wifey at? Niggas like you, I spit lightly at
Quote my little cliche, instant replay
Could've sworn I saw a nine, had it tucked in her thong
Off convo, pointed at the condo, Lex let's go
I could've sworn I kept it real, but I'm a asshole
Hide in the empire, yellow liar took a glass full
Dick now, hotter than a lighter


Yo, whatever you do kid, just keep it real with yourself
Don't never ever pass off blue kid
Just better watch her, fuck around and be a nightmare


Yo, rainbow, glossy flossy necklace
Look perpetuos, ass is fat, butu look treacherous
Yo, where Gloria at? Monster ass restin' in Astoria
Black lawyer, she own a blow laundrymat
Yellin', I remember her, in December
Bitches maced me, stoled a half a million outta Macy's
Short light skin, haircut, hazel eyes
Nasal laced up, raised in caprini greens with Asia
Metallic blue G.S., dressed just bought a mama E.S
Fuckin'n with some nigga, Louis Lex
He a rich nigga, call him a king, H12
Rock a Super Bowl rings, had a mean bilingual
Her uncle fuck Marsha, fake mobster
Tried to knock, that drinkin' cum bitch, blown an Oscar
De La Hoya hands, burn him like boiling water
If she dare take food in her mouth, spoon advance
Yellin', hit the mini-bar, Shallah looked laced
Spillin' Henny on, shorty just drive and throw Jimmy on
We rappin', ain't jack shit happen
Stop all this max, homey, back to my WAP, pretend mackin'
Chill, hit the jack for a sec, shorty holdin', wanna give me sex
Should I just, polly or flex
Yo, tell me more, yo, you heard of I-King
Drive a white thing, wife in the bing, doing life, a knight king
Yeah, I know the nigga, what's the verdict? So what he perverted?
Last word I heard, A.C.T. want him murdered
Hesitated, played it, grabbed my dick, shorty playa hated!




No tricks, no tricks baby
Yeah, aiyyo Rae
Check it out y'all
It's the science
Fly wonderful
Yeah y'all
Tony Starks and umm Lex Diamonds
Tony Starks, my nigga Nas
Strength my whole team is eatin off this type of shit
For all the fake niggas out there, yaknahmean
Word up
Good shit, nigga next time, no more whatever shit
Fakes be celebratin but they be mistaken
Word to the wise
Keep your eyes open and your wallet in your front pocket
All types of shit, yo son
Rock it, RZA Chef Ghost and Nas niggas is the prophet
Tell em it's on right?
Show those crabs how to rhyme
RZA, Chef, Ghost, and Nas niggas is the prophet
It's only like five percent out of a hundred
RZA Chef Ghost and Nas niggas is the prophet
Do it to em baby


Through the lights, cameras, and action glamour glitters and gold
I unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
When I'm deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast
To conquer peace leaving savages to roam in the streets
Live on the run, police paying me to give in my gun
Trick my wisdom with the system that imprisoned my son
Smoke a gold leaf I hold heat, nonchalantly
I'm raunchy, the things I do is real it never haunts me
While, funny style niggas roll in the pile
Rooster heads profile on a bus to Rikers Isle
Holding weed inside they pussy with their minds on the pretty things in life
Props is a true thug's wife
It's like a cycle, niggas come home, some'll go in
Do a bullet, come back, do the same shit again
From the womb to the tomb, presume the unpredictable
Guns salute life rapidly, that's the ritual


Perhaps bullets bust niggas discuss mad money
True lies and White guys, we can see it through the eyes
Catch the most on tape, kilos disintegrate
Pyrex pots, we break, fiends licking plates
In the building niggas building like little children, staring
Them older niggas ain't caring
Sirens circling fiends are lurking in your baggage
Oh one's gone now, what, smack him in his cabbage
In the woodwork, crack sales bubble like Woolworth's
In the projects, richest niggas rocking all the real worth
Police questioning, rooftop cats invested in
Trading in they Lexuses, GS's, sending messages
Two and two makes four, Cristal's crazily pour
Gun wars my crew feel em like swords


Rock the green leathers, hundred pound snakes and cakes
Fiends found in lakes, jealously Jakes we shake
What I strive for is what I live for
Infatuated by material things in this wild life of war
Like somewhere over the rainbow
I see a big pot of gold
Future stacks so I hold
Thousands of cracks bagged up inside the shoebox
Don't keep jack in my lab, don't wanna see 2Pac
Got two spots on New Lots, flooded with rocks
Shoot-outs making me hot, crooked cops bag Tony and the ball drop
In the Isle, I'm banging niggas for slot time
Hurry up duke I'm next on line
And what the fuck is you looking at
By the way young blood, hit me off with that Green Bay hat
Watch your back inside the hall, new niggas slide through
Like doors yo, you're staring in the mess hall
Your adrenaline runs, cigarette niggas be swindling
New jacks surrendering, come home not remembering
Made bail with different size kicks on, a white dress shirt
Looking gay in the yard, and you got hurt
Flashbacks, of the day room, mop wringer style
Your faggot ass got bashed trying to turn the dial
You told your boo you was whyling
Once you heard Wu, out of the blue, your family's from Shaolin
High class cooks, throw on vests out of phone books
Infirmary niggas are screaming, "I got juxed!"
Sharpened toothbrushes, 190 mixed with baby oil and shit
Your man's in the kitchen stashing ice picks
Well I'mma end this with a big red cherry on top
Me, Nas and Rae got the best product on the block


Strength my whole team is eatin off this type of shit
Word up, throw your hands up
Good shit, nigga next time, no more whatever shit
Cock back the Mac an say whatever
Keep your eyes open and your wallet in your front pocket
Your Hawaiian's stale, exoticness, fly shit
RZA Chef Ghost and Nas niggas is the prophet
Floatin on in nine-five in the basement








Heed the battle call, check the catalog
Flow so crazy it's adderall with the padded walls
More twisted turns in the body that's on the baddest broad
These cattle call 'rappers' is weak, my honor matter more
Your whole style stiffer than mannequins you see at a store
You mannequins are Chante & Kenny, I mean the Latter more
No ping pong and we volleying with the back and forth
Straight King Kong and the trap we blasting off, son


You want Nigerian money, see me in Qatar drunk
Waving the K, I can't fake the funk
Blessed with the belts, flying in the stealth
Jewelry on the neck, diamonds in the Cheals
You know I wrestle with pawns, getting my money, we gone
The automatic laying player, we Dons
You can't see us, the new phenoms, I like the Benz zeons
Split your wig like I got three arms
I need a fianc, at least a Beyonc
I know my vision beyond some other shit
I'm just as meaty as moms
I'm supposed to be on, the greenery gone
I'm still the king of the drama
Put the Ruger down your throat, eat my Johnson nigga


Way they all in their feelings, what's wrong with niggas
Forgetting silence is still a response
The way the blood paint the wall you can tell he really an artist
I get it like Whitey Bulger 'til rapture, dearly departed

 x2
We gon' Lex in, my nigga
These are blessings, my nigga
Keep stressing, my nigga
Don't stress, little nigga
Eat a clip, little nigga
Niggas trip, little nigga
Violations we gon' flip, little nigga


It's the champion flow, the Jordan, LeBron and Kobe
The Obi Wan Kenobi, of getting that guap-a-mole
We touring overseas, got her fanning out like a Dakota
I'm trying to get the check, I'm Martina Navratilova
Catch me at the races, gateway at Saratoga
They trying to place my face cause we mobbing, we taking over
My niggas keep it pure while you cut with the baking soda
These rappers be stretching the truth like they taking yoga
Couch potatoes, now they made us into a vegetable culture
A result of division like it's a decimal quotient
Do the math, my nigga, do the math
You'd never settle for less than the whole if you knew the half


Rough as alligator skin getting crazy grip
I'm so amazing with words I make a baby spit
Resting in Tibet, wild with the Gillette
Giraffe long goose on, my boots is 
Pocket full of coins, producers on set
Niggas with the coupes is on next
The losers gon' step, the users gon' check
We choosing our ninjas, the Jews is on deck
Refuse, that's a debt, pool with the steps
Everybody see us, the tools is all TECs
Anything come through we school, wan' bet?
Fuck you gon' tell us? He knew we on next


They wanna act like they know me, you don't know me nigga
You got the baby boy hustle, you a Jody nigga
You wanna swim with the sharks, I'm Chief Brody killin'
Get your jaw tapped this is raw rap, come on, yeah

 x2




Apocalypse Now, mind over matter
Next batter be Tical, put it on a platter
How much uncut raw shit we dealing with?
Murder track what? Slang killing it, touched
You feeling it in your bloodstream
Deadly Venomous elixir hammer like Sledge that be Sister
All In Together Now, follow me the Mister
Mef Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh
Death come in the scripture, 2001
Bring the rap Armageddeon, let it be known
When you walk up in this Dead Zone, with all that wack shit
Now you know you dead wrong, one thousand lashes


Detonate that, pussy Massengil rap cleanse that
The kids rank, snatch collars off while riding off
Float boat big boys, Oakland A's stashed away blades
Ventilation let the sharks Animaze
Something shiest like seven butcher knives
Rolling Rover style twice, finger itchy like lice, hair fell out
Something to conquer, stomp ya like that cat Blanka
Toy Tonka truck, ten carat on ya monster
Ring rocky like fuck switch sides like water rides
The DAT bubble life preserve the other guys
Now fuck y'all act wilder
The style wilder than a praying mantis, chilling like
(long inhale)


As my brothers and I reign rebellious, changing
The courses of time, devils no longer exist
As God Cipher Divine, all minds one, no question
Now check it
Perhaps we can go through Lessons
Or might shot me a pussy protesting
Coming with that lip professing, you must take Allah for fool
Where's his Jewel? Was he using Mathematics as a tool?
Tell me, the struggle is God and I came to build
Shit is so real, inside you distilled
Back in the form of mist, you wishing you did the Knowledge
Before speaking, seeking, where you went wrong
And why would I bring you such physical harm?


Mind arson, my squadron surround the SoundGarden
Guns for hire plus you under fire and a target
Sniper in the cypher, I Pied Piper
Move the housing by the thousand, I watched out the Chrysler
Bombs strike ya like the Mighty Thor, blast the door
Recite a page like a tidal wave crash the shore
Two pulls, I'm wild like mechanical bulls
Pack a full house, it's girls night out, pull a handful
Heavenly laced, stimulation make it feel slow paced
I motivate and await my sober state


Magnificent, heavenly the God stay bent
Five Percent, Range whipping, Soul Controller of the lynch
Macking phone rings, Stephen King drama down at Danzine
My mood swings, suplexed off the rope, magazine
Coconut juice, walnut colored shoe, ninth annual
Moses lost his sandal hiding the manual
Blowing evangel bugging off of Bon Jovi hits
Grandma Lowvey, famous murder weapon was a trophy
Seeds posing in Osh Kosh, guzzle Grolsch
Sabotage massage rap bandit at large
Wolverine Carnation Milk, Wu denim jeans
Thurston Howell the Third, kid's back on the scene
Call it chopped meat cause every word is choppy
Malachi crunch all crows to death, Kobayashi couldn't stop me
Getting caught up in my world, Hagen-Dazs swirl
Back flip and then a twirl, cave your whole world in




I wanna be where you are
Where you are


You see my heart won't let up
I'm trying not to fall
Wish I could write you a letter
I know you heard it all before
What I mean
What I want is
I want to be where you are
Where you are
Safe from harm
In your arms
In your


Got to stay on my feet, I can't slip
Remain focused because these vultures are lurking
Praying I don't win
But they can forget about it because I ran for this
Yeah tears and sweat devoting my life I planned for this
Keeping the slammer close, I'm not alone
Smoking that black cabbage
Making my enemies go poof begone
So the facts is
Money make niggas throw rocks at the throne
I'm thinking
Spoilin' their action
Reality is I mean business
Please stay out my way
For real I'm serious, negativity out my space
I wear grown man britches, this is no child's play
Making haters love me
So our relationship is love/hate
See I describe great
And you despise that
Putting pressure back in this game
Word from this live cat
Niggas besides that
I'm from a place where most don't make it out alive
And homicide can't even buy that


You see my heart won't let up
I'm trying not to fall
Wish I could write you a letter
I know you heard it all before
What I mean
What I want is
I want to be where you are
Where you are
Safe from harm
In your arms
In your


Some of my niggas is still taking penitentiary chances
Life lessons
They never learned whether they lived or die
They not concerned
Caught in the system
Flips, they got mouths to feed
By any means they got to earn
Who am I to knock 'em
If they cover their faces stocking
Run up in the spots and let the Glock kick
That used to be me
Young, ruthless, and carefree
Until I seen the bigger picture
Shifted, my way of thinking
That 25 to life is real
So is the casket once it close on you
Word to the youth
Its not a game, cause life'll swerve on you
And she's a bitch
And could care less about the nerves on you
To either what I'm saying
One day it might change your life
From poor to rich living
Better fresher in white leather
From out the hand me downs
Flashing high-priced threads
Matching the foreign cars in the driveway
Living that wealth forever
From me to you young world
Here's my letter


You see my heart won't let up
I'm trying not to fall
Wish I could write you a letter
I know you heard it all before
What I mean
What I want is
I want to be where you are
Where you are
Safe from harm
In your arms
In your


Coming from the city where they run out
You know I seen it all before
I ain't here to judge (?)
You know I done it all before
Coming from the city where they run out
You know I seen it all before
I ain't here to judge (?)
You know I done it all before



Chorus -
(One) gun go off, showin' everything is lost
(Two) hold between me and you, these the rules, c'mon
(Three) yo, we gotta stand together to take cream'n
(Four) without me and you the crew just could never be

Verse 1:
Imaginative mental, blood flyin'
The most hardest niggas cock they iron
Foul, live like a Lion
Listen to the streets and your gun go off
Sorta like a show off
Jungle way of livin', hittin' dro off
Lifestyle changes niggas see that
They gettin' anxious just to throw one in your ski hat
Watch your language, yeah, you fresher than a Million bucks
You got a new hustle, you hardly knew niggas would envy lust
They gettin' hungrier and niggas bust
They lit a bigger dutch
Fixin' them Calicos to dig your guts
Detectives roam
Niggas come home and got a bigger dome
Ready to zone on what a nigga own
Caught in the mischief
How can you live when it's a sickness
That sorrounds that projects and the trenches
Walkin' through the bushes at night
You gotta be sharp like a butcher knife
Subtly show up when the jooks is right
And everything will have a major like
Whether it's black or white
Nobody knows until they snatch your life
Wake up son, the season's just a thing the mind make up
It's only real kid, ha, wake up!

Chorus 2x

Verse 2:
The meat market pardon me, the heat market
Chill, we got it on lock, the nigga got to sweet talkin'
I gotta eat and got the beast targeted
Relax, my Brothers on 'role, niggas got police barkin'
They want us killed, sieze the sargent
Blowin' each cartridge
We ill, realer in each market
Feel the leather jacket, sleek ostrich
Unleash the arsonist, just popped the wig off of each hostage
Make it real and make his niece watch it
Yokin' Grandmothers up, we kill until his peeps squash it
Verse is somethin' mean regardless
A green jar of harvest
Just smoke, niggas got the green Garcia's
A terrifying team of heartless
Move on the Narcs's
We only on it for extreme profits
And anyway we dream darkness
I saw it through the Jean Paul Gotier mint green gleam optics
So wake up Son, the season's just a thing the mind make up
It's only real kid, ha, wake up

Chorus 2x

Verse 3:
A message from Elijah's kids
My eyes opened, got wise on the biz
Start risin' my wig
Seen everything I saw before
Had dreams behind a wall
All I wanted was to balance my all
Make it through feedin' my kind
Readin' the lines
On how the dollar bill is shaped and designed
Taught from the Eighties
Talk, build, and protect all Babies
Strong shelters with strong Ladies
A nigga died, died amongst Daisies
He did it for the Babies
Thats peace, feed 'em if they gettin' lazy

Chorus 2x




What you doin' on our turf, punk?
Got a message for Smokey
Give it
You Smokey, man?
Give it!
If you ain't Smokey, it ain't yo' motherfuckin' message
Motherfucker, I said gimme the message!
It's from Willie, in the slam
Nigga, you been busted?
Yeah, the man picked me up
Well, I ain't got no fuckin' time to play witchu! Now gimme the message
Willie's in Warwick, doin' 1-3. Told me to tell y'all motherfuckers to
Keep cool. He be out one way or another. Quick. Maybe I could stick
Around for awhile
Naw, that's out, man. You know? What can we The Lords do with a punk like you?
Kiss my ass, motherfucker! (Burn 'em) Just me and you, motherfucker, just
Me and you. I put trademarks around your fuckin' eye!]




Raekwon:

Yo, Gambino niggas who swipe theirs
Deluxe rap cavaliers
Midgets who steal beers, give 'em theirs

Chorus: Raekwon

Sit back jollyin'
My team be gamin' like three card Rolly an'
Drug Somalians pollyin'


Many raps they crochetin'
Ay yo Iron, these niggas portrayin'
But haven't been payin'
For real, slide on these niggas like flesh fear
Caesar fade style, usually tough grenade
Throw a blade, fuck gettin' laid
Guzzle this shit like Gatorade
Big-dick Wallies have never half-suede
Connectin' with the hot style is done
Light up a chalis
I run with nuttin' but the wildest, foulest
Come on now, long-dick style
Niggas on the hit out, ay yo Iron bite my shit out
Eventually, bust a rap gun mentally
Been doin' this century kid, just meant to be
Get on your knees and bless me with a gem in the Caribbean
Skiin' off by P.M
Snatch Canadian cream with Scandinavians
Fellatium style, play it like thirty-two Arabians
The greatest lesson is don't owe, you might get stole on
When I go bury me wit Valow on

[They come to me, and understand, just let me get mines first. Then after I
Get mines, y'all can do what y'all wanna do. Fuck 'em up bad]


'Sho 'nuff, hit the bank and thrust
Cool Nauticas Jamie Summer got trained on the tour bus
We upgrade, swallow raw eggs, read the label
Hittin' white-label, left the Winnebago unstable
Smooth sailin', walked in, my earth started kneelin'
Started stealin', I'm too ill, see we're bellin' at the parlay
Kicked up, mack, max motion
Michael Bolton magazine call, I'm too potent
Louisville mix pain kill rap, Fuck benadryl
The violin in 'Knowledge God' sounded ill
Tremendously obnoxious, no blotches
My telephone watch'll leave bartenders topless
Dead on the prosecutor, smacked a juror
Me and my girl'll run like Luke and Laura
We sit back on Malayan islands
Sippin' mix drinks out of boat coconut bowls, we whylin'

(Break) Raekwon:

Sit back jollyin', Uh huh, Uh huh
Uh huh, Uh huh, Sit back jollyin'
Uh huh, Uh huh, Uh huh, Uh huh

(Chorus) x 2

Sit back


Deep meditation sound orientated, war the blizzard
Rap para-medical the wizard
Cappadonna, never caterin' to none
My microphone and three verse weigh a ton of slaughter
You oughta five thousand back across the water
My laboratory story keep me flowin' with the glory
Acapella or deep dirty instrumental
I could blow the sky like the stormy wind blew
One gallon of whylin', Park Hill profilin'
I cut your face up rough fifty sure while you're smilin'
For violatin' my position
I leave you smoked like a crackhead on a mission
Two tokes of mic dope, one stroke of elegance
Rated like the movie graphic told intelligence
Person to person, it'd be hard for you to take a trophy
You better off to get somebody out to try to smoke me
Cause I'm P-L-O T-K-O every day
Dancehall General, Party Fanatic Colonel
Cappadonna son'a old school just go infernal
Veteran for rappin' with the new set of rule of hard rappin'
Ninety-six jive, I keep the live crowd clappin'
When I bow, all praises due to Staten Isle
I spark the mic and Shaolin spark the methtical
Every evenin', I have a by myself meetin'
Thinkin' who's gonna be the next to catch a beatin'
From my mental slangin', bitchin' rap twist the point of warfare
I brutalize, all competition catch ill hair
Chance him, that's what they said, threw up a ransom
I jacked it, stripped the beat naked and packed it
Gimme my rewards

[The way I, the way I wanna get 'em. I want 'em gotten. I want 'em layin'
Out. I want 'em gotten. Cause niggas need to be gotten. He need to be
Taken off of here. That's right.]




*sniff* Yo, boo, calm down, man
Chill 'fore you break your nose, man
What up, what up, king (yo what's going on?)
(Yo, oh, who the fuck is this?)
(Yo, walk this bitch outta here, man)
(Her hands is all white and shit, looking all crazy)
Fingerprints all over the refrigerator
You fake ass Gucci wearing nigga!
Yo, girl, chill chill, come on, man
Just give me papi number, man, for real, man, you playing


I'm on the crisp blue yacht, with my hand on the twat
With a Commodore CD, a bottle of stock
On a green rug, GG's on it, a mean snub
Bad little Asian, named Asia, my love
Had connects, plus fame favorite flick, Black Rain
Pinky finger rocked up, giving me brain
Like Griselda's little flame, ran with her for forty months
Came home, her estate was insane
Vuitton toilet paper, Polo walls, Jimmy Choo
Pots and pans, this broad had a horse
Cash it in, yo, Masta, live with me, take it all
You can have whatever, five hundred leathers
Bruno Mag' sweaters, Gucci rain boots
Brook Brothers, New Eras, jew killers
New line sponsored by fellas, catch 'em in the hall balling
I thought about it, whatever


(Walk with me) Relax and get your facts right
(Walk with me) You know we only getting cash in the fast life
(Walk with me) Living, giving my all, I give it back, right
(Walk with me) We die, we die together, this the last night


CNN watching, ESPN friend
Coat shopping, lochness, smothered up, god damn
Boo living it good, Aspen, the color of wood
On the outside, vibe is good
Knowing I'm hood, I should, escape project life
Run with my rifle, live in the woods
Grow a rugged beard, and chill, poppa real
Poppa eat, poppa a rolling stone, for real
This the deal, chill, this how we live in the Hill
Kill a nigga for me, kill or be killed
Share that money and still, when it's time to reveal
You never met me, but respect me, you will
Dinosaur wheels we peel, skated with the fly seals
She broke out, died in Brazil
Met her younger cousin Nil', you looking for birds, right?
Yeah, my cousin said you real, you gotta




Oh shit, Goldschlger in the gold dagger in a gold Acura
A gold Phantom pulled up, yo, go backwards
They had a package on 'em, hold half a bit, it's half rough
But still, I got me forty traffickers
Riding through Manhattan tough, got my mavericks up
We on, rolling thirty deep in the gadget trucks
Spending magic bucks, fuck around, get an Aston truck
Fly around, fucking actress sluts
We been clashing with the masses, what
Put the gasses up, flame 'em out his lab, splash him up
That's how we get it on, that's what's up
Don't ever wrassle us, you might get shackled in your castle, what
Play with the boys, that's the stuff
I'm talking bout, niggas they die, faster than a pastor fuck
Seeing 'em mourn me, flash a buck
Pull a bulb out, like Con Ed, keep it on a massive hush




Come on, man, word up, let 'em talk
Put this bag out, and after that, take it to heed
Man, I see you in a minute, chill
You got to lay on the other side of the fucking wall for you
Word up, this the nigga face, man, I only got four million, man
Straight up, last thing I heard, the nigga grandmother was in Argentina
I want her too, for real, for real, we ain't playing no games, man
The nigga like to shop and floor shine
He stay on 44th, catch the nigga by Delancey, too
For real, I got his baby pictures and everything
Word up, his cousin, his cousin is a security guard at Barnes/Nobles
For real, his little nephew, his little nephew work in the
Muthafucking fish store
Up in, 138th and Harlem, man...
This all the money for today, man
A lot of paper came in today, a lot of Franklins
Bring the other bag, son, yeah, hold it, huh
Toaster head nigga, get the fuck off of me




My nigga Raekwon talkin', uh-huh
Everythin' you want you don't need
And don't believe everythin' you read
And only half what you see


I said I won't, I don't need it, yeah
Don't believe everythin' you read, yeah
Only half what you see, yeah
Man, this shit is what it is, yeah, ooh


It's "Hello", oh, Lord

Your bitch turned down, this shit is love
Me and my niggas fill up, we goin' to war
We goin' to war (wall to wall)
My money's stacked up (wall to wall)
My shows' packed up (wall to wall)
Her ass stepped up (wall to wall)
Got my money up, we goin' to war


Clear view, dark tints, hustle by the park bench
White top, blue tops, niggas I don't call friends
'Til they called it love
Called my niggas, grabbed their hammers
'Bout to go to war
Prices on your head, I'm a spend it
Everythin' in that showroom, nigga, I was in it
On my son, I was in it, I was in it
Dirty money, ten chains, I be shinin' every minute
I'm shinin' every minute
Soft to the hard rock, Hard Rock Casino
Me and shorty watchin' Nino in the hardtop
I done counted ten mills when that ball dropped
Me and Chinx poppin' bottles out in Far Rock


I said I won't, I don't need it, yeah
Don't believe everythin' you read, yeah
Only half what you see, yeah
Man, this shit is what it is, yeah, ooh

My money's stacked up (wall to wall)
My shows' packed up (wall to wall)
Her ass stepped up (wall to wall)
Got my money up, we goin' to war


Frozen fishscale, you better go to Ishmael
Tiger-skin hammer, sittin' by the Benz grille
Knots of hundreds; it's lunch, kid, play fair
Say "yeah," feed your brother, be's a one, shit
Enough money to slum kids, kings with pillows
Leave your body, yo, under the dumpsters
Take money suitcases, bracelets, cake mix
Come out the hole, this is weight flicks
So much bread, we build lead houses
Run in the shed, see dead thousands
Faces, we call 'em big noses
Flashin' in the foreign shit
Grubbed up niggas is wasted


I said I won't, I don't need it, yeah
Don't believe everythin' you read, yeah
Only half what you see, yeah
Man, this shit is what it is, yeah, ooh


It's "Hello", oh, Lord

My shows' packed up (wall to wall)
Her ass stepped up (wall to wall)
Got my money up, we goin' to war


Yo, whip my feet up, gettin' manicures in a zap
And spectacular visuals
Niggas be camera-phonin' up my movement
Everythin' we do to sit and take precedents
While we go stackin' residuals
Niggas starvin' to know just how we do it
Absolutely be stayin' the money every night (Dracula)
Niggas, stay up in it like Jamaicans and stay in the maximum
Difficult to predict, I'm calculated like algebra
Cause the money traced back to them diamond mines out in Africa
We in the future with it though, closin' my eyes for pictures
Phone'd have me speak with holograms
When I'm buildin' with bitches
And then I bang 'em like body slammin', one-handin' 'em ishes
Like I was sellin' warheads and I'm baggage handlin' missiles
Fuck it, decided to blow an M just bein' silly
With a bob and a step and a charisma like I sit on a billi
And for the five percent with the science
And the ones that really get me
I got a lot to do with civilizin' and countin', I'm busy


I said I won't, I don't need it, yeah
Don't believe everythin' you read, yeah
Only half what you see, yeah
Man, this shit is what it is, yeah, ooh


It's "Hello", oh, Lord
When you're tryin' to bail out, who to call?
Your bitch turned down, this shit is love
Me and my niggas fill up, we goin' to war
We goin' to war (wall to wall)
My money's stacked up (wall to wall)
My shows' packed up (wall to wall)
Her ass stepped up (wall to wall)
Got my money up, we goin' to war


Salute, salute, yeah
Montana, what up, baby?
Word up, you know what it is, my nigga
Louis Rich right here, baby
Yeah, you know what this is, nigga




Well I and I a risin' star, lawd a mercy
(Yo let me get that Dutch master)
Well Bounty Killer and Raekwon a rising star
(This goes from New York to Jamaica y'all)
Lawd a mercy... war and crime and violence, is all this boy preaching!
(New York to Jamaica yo)
Never stop until gunshot reach him
Me sing, me sing, cho!
(Yo let me get that Dutch)


War! and all type a thing this guy preaching
Copper shot reach him, and him dead
There is nobody in this world to accept him
Raekwon just kill him, and then said
Gunshot a bark underneath boy skin
Well New York say
I, wonder if one day that
Some idiot would say that, them want a war
Me have a 45 Haskell and all a gun big so til it naah no name
And can't hold inna mi car
Gunshot a bark underneath boy skin



Junglist
Dem ask fi war, and now dem get it
Then dem all a bawl, say dem can't defend it
45 Haskell me pop out and end it
Bwoy a tell story like him name Louise Bennett
Gunshot a drop inna him heart and him gullet
Lick off the pants buckle, gone wid him wallet
Lost all the one dollar coin inna him pocket
Bwoy a confront di Wu-Tangs wid all ratchet
Watch it! Hey mi gun a bark like a rocket
Big like a plane, mi guns large like the market
Get hook by yu mouth, and dead like a mullet




Relax your soul like Clarks from England
These terrorists brothers is back, gun cocked, wit their jewelry swingin'
Collab on, we get laced in the Avalon
Runnin' the Dutch, my marathon, Don, carry on
These scandalous brothers, we trample this
Fake and get blamp'd wit this, Bounty and Chef, don't even sample this
A loner, a sharp tie-your-brother-up owner
Pass the Corona, what's the science Bounty? (...man grow me)
All they knew, he was wit Shaolin now
Police be wildin', you know, so we was splurgin' in, Virgin Islands
This Mediterranean lady try to play me then
Came wit a man, he had a ruger, he's Arabian
He had a accent, plus his back was bent
I'm on the corner, there's a Cressida wit black tints




Diamonds, come and walk wit me, gun point emotionally
Playin' me close like he suppose to be
He looked at 18, word to my son
He was a paid fiend, gettin' money in Jamaica, Queens
Lex' keys fell out my pocket, yo, dun, he cocked it
Ready to blaze me like a sky rocket
Suddenly stunned, dunn dropped the gun
So now it's over, now I'm slidin' in a Rover wit one
We stay trifler, rude boys buildin' in the ghetto cypher
A year from now I buy my bitch a tiger


Word up, no infiltrators, only Wally gators
(Gunshot a bark underneath boy...)






These streets is watchin' the way you move
(Watch how you move nigga)
So be careful in all that you do
(Watch what you doin' nigga)
If you shittin' where you eat it might cause you trouble
And this ain't nothing that I've heard
Only what I've learned
Mark my words
So please don't sleep
(Don't you do that)
Or the wolves come to eat
(Them niggas hungry)
And they sniff you out
And make you a target
Boy better run for cover
(Run for cover nigga)
Are you hearin' what I'm sayin?
Cause you know them boys ain't playin'
When that thing go "POP!"
Better hope it ain't for you


Yo, early to rise
As I'm recollectin'
I'm cookin'
That thing up for breakfast
One of my sons'll
Go get the paper
While I'm robed up
Louis house slippers
Nasty stocking cap on
Smoking a  while I plot on another caper
Respectively, see I've been genetically blessed
To move like I'm a G-F
Designer cigars and pinky rings
Ain't no question how we move on bigger things
On the patio speakin' of old connecs
My Dominican/Puerto Ricans
Pablo Augustus and Miguel Filejo
They be speakin' with strong accents
And have they soldiers shoot you, pendejo
Re-aligning the link after the convo
Gettin' back to it fast
Compadres papered up
Probly floodin' my stash
Booty-makin bitches be countin' my cash
Walk around wearin' nuttin'
Diesel as fuck
Cellulite dimples in they ass
Peep the way how I prosper
And I prophet
Gettin' cook and then grindin' it up
While I make sure these niggas ain't try'na line me up
(Gone!)


These streets is watchin' the way you move
(Watch how you move nigga)

Yo, I think this moment's lookin' spectacular
Very eventful and special
Detail, in-particulars is essential
Emaculate from the talk to the dress-up
All the way down to the coke in the kitchen
Shallah, please do the cheffin' stuff!



"Yo, what the fuck happened?
Yo, slap him
Yo Rhymes, put the mac in his mouth"
I slipped, "No you di'int
This nigga is slippin'"
Different nigga from the kid we used to fuckin' wit'
I'm out in 
And this coke's frozen
Nigga, suck a dick
Bust' popped him
Shot him in his wind pipe
I stabbed him in his hand
Bust' shot him again
Six million grams in the sink
Down the drain
I'm to blame
We the 
Got to call the connect up
"Papicito, catch the train now!"
It's war in the world
We both riders
They comin' in gliders
Hear the wings pull up
We wool up
Bullet-proof boxers and socks
Two twin choppers, the Glocks
Was 30-shot; new joints.  We both toxed
Then he walked in... leather 'n chucks
Old sneakers from the 80's
A crazy, my columbian pops
This is a wild caper
Fresh off the block
To the yachts





* samples were not cleared for the official album release


Y'know? General, general! Word out...
Yeah...
Aiyyo man.. you poppin fuckers
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


It's just rules with beats - you clown niggas can't rule the streets
We set shop! Wu-Tang, we rule the East
Taking over the block!
"From the gate now!"
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
Aiyyo, it's just rules with beats - you clown niggas can't rule the streets
We set shop! Wu-Tang, we rule the East
Taking over the block, you can't fuck with the block!
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Aiyyo, I stay funky and piley, blue Excelero
They lookin for me, what the fuck you behind me for?
Stressing everything I breathe on
I'm from the boulevard where niggas get jacked and peed on
Whatever homey, we more lavish
I might sneak you in the crib, see my lasers and glasses
Try to get my come up on
Yo, and when you see me, you know I got my "come up" arm on
Cartier called me up, robbery here
We got your seed in the back of the Beemer starving
We like lion killers, catch me on stage with the gauge
In my right hand, grenade and this leather bomber
I scout money, you know we hungry and talk funny
Coughing out corner rappers, don't never walk up on me
I write with only insane Malkovich
My troops gave me money to clown with them, fuck it
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


My first gun was a .32, back before uh!
Graduated to the .38, maybe a nine
I prefer the fo' five, stay alive
Techs held the crack gank in '88
8 oz. straight from Florida, the best temp
Camouflage vest, repping the set
Wu on the east wing, twenty-ten, sexy bad
We up at Spain with that thing thing, my crew strong
We take no search for your party dunn, you know how I run
Spray places, cover faces, beat cases
A big mouth will get your teeth knocked the fuck out
Keep a nunchuk, take money, stay ninja
I injure, any motherfuckin contender
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Hey bitch, your time's up! Go finish them rhymes up
All my soldiers is lined up, my corners is crimed up
Niggas know where to find us, settin the grind up
Police checkin them pies up, my rims are shined up
Wu! We on the rise up, crops supplied up
Plottin niggas demise up, boxed in conduct
Scratch we got 'em sized up, and when the East is in the house
You, you, you, you, you...
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


On the side of the projects, grey skully, bubble 'Lo goose
Mac 11 tucked in front of the belly
Prestigious moves, we killin 'em, hoes we drillin 'em
We like George Foreman out in the streets, we grillin 'em
In the van, .45's and dilly's, ready to slam it
House arrest box is goin off, Tony got grams
Gotta bath tub full of white, lay in it like Sam Montana
Tune 'em out, to blow out, chop 'em like fans
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


This is boulevard hard, lounging in your black car
Camouflage rat guard on "Stomp the Yard"
I-N-S spit monster bars, flip long regards
My click dons bitch, y'all are frauds
I get it in like Tim off the glass
Slamming my name, I'm like the prez, sending men off to blast
What I spit, make 'em spend all their cash
I'm so Wu, so new that I ain't ripped off the tags
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


RZA done birthed us, some curse on purpose
I'm the grouch, my mouth is a circus
Burner plus a good learner, don't need a hood
All I need's a good burner, Nat Turner
Snake rat murderer, all I hear is turf talk
Rack rooms full of goons with bullet wound birthmarks
From the first spark, you heard my response
(Wu-Tang!) More results talkin 'bout whole crew's mission just lost
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Out the beehive, you dip and you dive
But you still can't survive, you can't see past five
Check the outlook, this is not in the book
You bein dragged across the floor while your 'dro in my hook
Lyrical joust, found all the deal off the books
Steve Rif gave the nod to Universal, good look
Still spit poison venom, Red Monkey and Wu dem
Have any dudes seen the condos? It's all 'em
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Put my +clan in da front+, +reunite+ 'em
Make 'em all R.S.V.P., if they want it, we don't invite 'em
No beef, less talk and more action
We parole as a whole, we'll send you back in fractions
Break through fanatic, low crates deep in attics
The Abbott pulled out a .45, looped with static
I scrolled through the menu then rolled to the venue
The dress code is armor all, put a hole up in him
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)




If only we can lay our hands on that vixen Yu Shin Hua
Then all our problems will be over...
Yu Shin Hua!


You thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed


The quintessence, father of the hip hop renaissance
My slang been around before baton and Benetton
I've been on, fingerprint, two finger tips
So when I squeeze the rubber grip, release the clip, then leave the clip
C-Cypher Pigs can't identify it
The true and living God, son, we exemplify it
The most complicated 'formance of life, we simplify it
Bzzz, don't knock it til you try it
Flying dagger, make 'em stagger, then I take a swagger
Ice cold Jgermeister, take a drag of
Humboldt County kush, slide like the Nike swoosh
Bruce Almighty got more problems than Spidey, look
Old Brooklyn, Putnam Avenue crook, I've been tooken
All around the world, rooked it then, drive back in Brooklyn
Good looking, son, yo, son, bring the hook in
You can never find Zig weak spot, stop looking




From the continents to Croatia, I'll flame a lamester
With the new slang, much more to show ya
These rocks change, Glock fully, hot pellets
Have me running through the hall, it's on, like you being chased by the relic
Can't nothing harm me, yo, I move through any project
With logic, few semi's, hide in the cockpit
Scream out, Shallah and I'mma tap in, harder than Tinactin
Don't try to play the fella, I'll blacked in
Moving all miraculous, the slap smiths of the rap game
Say my name backwards, you'll get back changed
Black man, black hooded, moving through the city
Like you Batman, still you so pussy, like Catwoman
Don't bother the Legion, more squeezing, more reason
To light a new block up, cause me to cement shit
Powerful block shoppers and all niggas getting that guac
Dare you to try to find my weak spot


You thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed

Verse 3: GZA
I stay on the 64 squares, while controlling the center
Trading space for material, the time zone I enter
It's calculated by movement, from pushed pieces
Advances in development, once the pawn reaches
The 8th ranked, now heavily armed with a tank
My opponent's base is threatend, soldiers cut with shanks
Moved all my small pieces, MC's are driven back
Unable to avoid capture from the attack
Such movement, is naturally quite unsound
Men is badly placed upon dangerous grounds
Loosening their position, before they were strongly posted
Before the double rooks had approached it
They must've been quick to ignore the principles
Rock a V and an effective God is invincible
A strategic plan, just the way I envisioned it
Many fallen soldiers in complete imprisonment


You thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed


I tell you, right, right, right, in ya muthafuckin' face
Muthafucka, you know, well, you know muthafuckin' well
Whenwe don't play that shit, or, I don't play that shit
That's just Wu-Tang. You know, I'm the nigga
That...that, give it to ya raw
When I said "First things first, man, you fuckin' with the worst
I be stickin' pins ya head, like a fucking nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with the fat rugged stack
Shame on you, when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zu"




Hailin from the slums of Staten
Extra gats, Massive workers, Some come home and collapse
Witness the style, Profile, Whillin, Floatin with spliffs
Dinosaur fifths, They all got style with it
Rockin raw pour genuine fabric, Know how to puff Arabic black
Donna trip, Slap a bitch, Drive nothin but sevens
Eleven of us, Hot legends that will pop for the record
All about trips, Flippin bricks, Minglin
Gleamin in your whore face, Jump out, what up bitch, Trick blingin
Hittin Cristal and coffee, Yellin get up off me
You want war, Fuck it, Give em all of me
For all the young coke buyers and triers, Live wires
Nice niggas down at the offerings yo
It's nothin, Came at yall niggas like what an
Skatin in the H2 eye, Pop the button
Flash that million dollar hand, He clan
He came through, Fisherman hat, Weather channel on
Lampin that fly dirty leather I got on, Blampted




Yeah

And the money multiply
Them niggas can't go where we go
They can't get dough like we do

Cause we go wherever we want


I skip prayers just to make money
I hope God forgive me, man

That's the new stretch bubble
Pipe the color of crust
Gettin' high, chillin' fly, yellin' 
Now I'm in hard bottoms
Larry King, suspenders and bow tie

Grind like a fiend for shit you've never seen
Watch me take it over, bitches be coming over
Money, we count it over, my niggas, they never sober
I pull up in the Bent, dark tint, black gun; sippin clip
Bent, clock in, black shoes, my attitude's
Fuck for the dollar, nothing, hit the bottle
Fifth clap skater lap, all black raider hat
Served the customers to custom make the Porsche
Nasir Jones, homie, the world is yours
I'm Tony Montana with a bitch from Atlanta
At the Caesers Cabana, then I'm ghost like a phantom, haan
Dirty money hit me like a needle
Got me standing on the street like the Beatles
I'm a motherfucking coke boy
Baby, come and run the world with a dope boy
(I'm a motherfucking coke boy)
(I-I'm a motherfucking coke boy, coke boy, coke boy)
(coke-coke-coke-coke boy)
(coke boy)
(I-I'm a motherfucking coke boy)


Some people, look in through the needle
This isn't where we started
They see you running through the fields
Deep inside a capsuled, freedom, you know nothing at all
We run, we run, we run
We run, we run, we run
We run, we run, we run
We can run the world

I got these funny MC's keep tryna get the lyrics
I got 300 Don C's and I can barely fit them
I'm like a nymphomaniac dating a schizophrenic
What I said is what I get I'm bettin the head ridiculous
We can run the world, just get the handcuffs off us
Mr. Officer, dont want no problems
I dont got no Glock, no girl, why you so forceful?
Its like Im sounding like Floyd before another bout
How you niggas doing, take off, sitting on mamas couch?
Bitch I did that shit with Raekwon the youngest with the clout

Im forever a poet, I was never a killer

Rocking on a great figure that doubled my digits
 said Im out of shape, nigga still running this city


Some people, look in through the needle
This isn't where we started


 amazing in weather, rocking big leathers
Catch him on the block stocking since the red jetters
Monkey flipping, brand gamble with the chop headers
Won't take no shorts, we don't jock niggas
Fast and furious, though curious
That I'll  from your home Julius
Just bounce, drop the Uzi and fly, meet you at the Ritz
Sweet 19 and switch up the whips, yo
Young De Niro, the black hand, mafia gang land
Where niggas bang out and do the same jam
I be in Brazil stroking 'em down
And for the hell I blame you, then fly like PamAm do
Whoever said I went down? I was configurating this money
To feed my babies monthly and retire
But now I'm more larger, smarter, call me the martyr
This separating me from these authors




So people, looking through the needle
This isn't where we started
They see you're running to the fields
Deep inside a capsule, freedom, you know nothing at all
We run, we run, we run
We run, we run, we run
We run, we run, we run
We can run the world



Yeah, all that 
Revolution eyes gangstas heads broccoli
 snipers and broccoli
This is all graphic from professinal killas, it's true
Don't get excited until we tell you too
Motile magnificent heavy armor rap
We go until the clock stop, don't bother black dudes
Billy club boys, those architects and street politics
Keep it hard like scholarships
Stadium shit, listen 2 bars exemplified
All I know is some came and some died
But from the cloth to the wardrobe fly, rich
Intelligent drama king is interchangeable like the Morris code




Who?!

ISHi?!

Who in the hell teaches you kung fu?
Your master must be an ignorant idiot as well!


(Uncle Ricky, would you read us a bedtime story?)
Nah kid, but I'mma give you one them old Raekwon crime joints
Feel me? We will, we will
We will, we will -- here we go


Well it was late one night, walking through the park
With my leathered down coat and Wallabee Clarks
Getting my step on, big shit, big six, big wrist
So much excitement in the air, I was crisp
Money suitcase, Louis joint
(yo, Rae, I'mma get some shit just like yours!)
Go make it happen, black God and get rich
Saw the D's fly by, in a New Yorker, yup, tints and shit
They made a right on me, them last two dicks
Know I seen 'em, Max loaded, jog right back to the car
They spun around again and blast their shit
I dropped a Backwood, a puff and then a 6-4-5
You'se a live nigga, you almost smashed your shit
I'mma don my way out the bitch, moving through the car
Nice and slow, two hoodies on and a golden pit
Nigga had a white eye, they both blacked down
What's the clown shit for? The dog jumped in the whip
It was a trained one, wops pointed at me (yo, nigga, freeze)


I told the Chef Raekwon, pump the brakes
Slow it down, you know these C-Cypher Punks scanned your plates
Release the seatbelt off the shoulders, a mile ahead
Then the vibe got a lot colder when the marksman said
"Black niggas in the Jeep, get the fuck out the car"
Put your hands where my eyes can see or suffer a scar"
He was a veteran, who kept, pepper spray in the canister
Donut shop lounger, thirty eight brandisher
On top of that, the blunt smoke just rang a bell
Of his bloodhound who had an acute sense of smell
Beef tripping, saliva dripping from razor sharp teeth
That was pointy as the daggers of the Indian Chiefs
Same cops known for extorting pimps and booking whores
Aimed Glocks at me and Rae, cause they was looking for
A few MCs wanted for a string of break-ins
Last seen, wearing long minks and snakeskins


We will, we will, rob you
We will, we will, Glock you
We will, we will, what? who? (not you)
Here we go


You know my Clan done ran from Japan to Atlanta with stamina
Peace to Chef, Mr. Meth
Move it on your left, with the Iron Lung breath
Ghostface Kill', U-G ill
Deck so real, Dr. Ason Unique, the medic
Ahh, Allah Just, The Abbott, y'all niggas can't forget it
You might catch a Cap if your shit ain't Street
Allah Mathematics make the cypher complete
See knowledge is the foundation of existence
To know starts the spark of the flow
Wisdom activation of the Nation moving
Wise words, show and prove or understand the 13 letters
And the Masta, culture be the way of life
Freedom is reward, who will pay the price for the power
Spending hour after hour, preparing his self
For the hour, now look how refined
When the mind and body is one, every part of me
Supreme equality, manifest the nature of self
G-O-D, now build and add on to the truth
Destroy the bullshit, born incomplete






What a shame, what a shame
Shame on a nigga who tried to run game on a nigga


This is it, boy
Stackin' money to the sky, gettin' rich, haaaan
Stackin' bricks to the sky, this is it, haaaan
When my dogs gettin' high gettin' rich, haaaan
And a nigga rich, haaaan


Shame on a nigga who tried to run game on a nigga
Pull a pistol, bang on a nigga
Beamer on the Boulevard, everybody know it's me
Bordeaux Polo, smoke a ton of weed
No room for nonsense, you under new ownership
Pullin' niggas' cards, givin' shooters bonuses
Fuck the rumors, now I'm standin' in a room with ya
Face, gut, buck 50, got two pistols
We the Knights of the Templar
Born dopeboy, oh, I should've been stopped
Def Jam see me as a threat now
Hundred mill, any less is a let down


This is it, boy
Stackin' money to the sky, gettin' rich, haaaan
Stackin' bricks to the sky, this is it, haaaan
When my dogs gettin' high gettin' rich, haaaan
And a nigga rich, haaaan


Full magazine, bitch, shoot for the stars
Snatch a nigga chain just to post it on the blog
Assassinate a name, nigga sprayin' in the dark
Hate you with a passion, but he askin' for a job
Shame on a nigga that tried to run game on a nigga
Pull a pistol, bang on a nigga
Gettin' money while them other boys bitter
I'm an artist and my niggas are the realest
What a shame pussy niggas wear glitter
Put to sleep by the pillowcase killer
Black Benz, black weed, black bottle, nigga
Rich, dirty niggas still mobbin', nigga


This is it, boy
Stackin' money to the sky, gettin' rich, haaaan
Stackin' bricks to the sky, this is it, haaaan
When my dogs gettin' high gettin' rich, haaaan
And a nigga rich, haaaan
This is it, boy
Stackin' money to the sky, gettin' rich, haaaan
Stackin' bricks to the sky, this is it, haaaan
When my dogs gettin' high gettin' rich, haaaan
And a nigga rich, haaaan

Catch me with a Spanish _______ _______
Average nigga, You crazy
To fuck with my wolves is bullshit, Them little guns is for daises
We got the T.I. joints

And everybody's contagious, And when them shots fly off
It's just a recipe for Chef and his cake mix

Ask you who the nicest, on mic devices
My lyrical crisis'll have you seein' "illusions" like Cypress
You bite this, wanna write this, so I might just
Teach you like them "teachers", that's "poor" and "righteous"
Sit you down and recite this, I like this
My crew shinin' wit tight sips, ya'll fools want
From a taste of Red Rum, wit a slight twist of Lou Diamond
I rule rhymin', ain't no if, ands, about that
Ask niggas around the way, you can beat me
They be like, "nah, I doubt that"
He's dangerous, don't try to follow, I'm sure to loose you

Get you growin' tumor, for tryin' think about my fly shit

Before you battle me, go to Apollo and rub that fuckin' log

Nigga, fuckin' up backs like beds wit no backspring

Leanin back on that good old alpaca
In the back of the vehicle and shit
Countin up motherfuckin 68 thousand
Two motherfuckin vests on the floor
Got mad reefer in the ash tray
Police put 17 cars away
You already know, man, shit is realer


Threw on the Harley leather sheepskin gloves, my Beretta
Bout to hit the ghetto, hard-body bring the kettle
Niggas is drinkin and gamblin, all you see is hammers in my corner
Champion sweats, hoes in pajamas
7-50 new blue, this is my lady
She stay playin suits, mad cute, two 3-80s
And her cousin, a police who live in the east
I knew him from the fifth grade, he definitely is a beast
A thug smugglin cop who live in the hood
Plus he rock a lot of Carhartt, Braveheart, die hard
The day I seen him, was the day they tried to rob him
They pulled out a flare gun, they shot out his charger
Yo, beast started simmerin at dice games and pubs
Niggas runnin up in alleyways gettin mugged
Niggas lucky, cause them other niggas butt
I sat back, calm as fuck, enter the conference


Whatever, whenever
Just keep that thing up on you
Wherever, whenever
Whatever, whenever
Just keep that thing up on you
Wherever, whenever


Show em how we position, all of the shit glisten
Stones flooded the Smith and, liquor, Im reminiscing
Fiends are still sniffin, sons are still in prison
My pen is still scriptin all of them ghetto visions
They gave me the contract, came where moms is at
Left a Audi 86 in the driveway in the mack
Felt like young Bond, Tom Forrest, slacks and metal lenses
Two polaroid pictures in front of his brothers Benzes
His sisters was some hustlin dykes, bullyin niggas
Ridin around, mollied up, plus suspended licenses
Hit the stash box  right there, a hundred in cash
Left a blue steel muzzle in the glove box, yikes
4:40 that morning, its foggy, Im under the Gotti
Louis jumper jacket, huntin hat cocky
Mad cause I aint fuck that morning
I had a Korean-Malaysian black sister with a thunder back ridin me
Made it to the balcony part
Tossed the rope around the big lion head statue, climbed up remarkably
Right by the window, they there
Took a glance through, they covered in Versace covers
Fuckin in the mirror
Couldnt see the faces, heard the moans
La Perla Draws hung off the sectional chair, cocked the chrome
Emptied the barrel, all you saw was goose down flyin
The trigger felt like wind, it was two bitches lyin there






Where Chops at?
Uh-huh, yeah, straight up magician shit
They call you The Butcher, huh?
Yeah, where The Butcher at? Where The Butcher?
This a Vocab/Ice Water colabo
Yeah... guns and ammo, you know me?
More ammo nigga, word up, go and do that


Aiyo, behold of the pale horse, or the nigga in the Rolls
With the code with the gold on, ill voice
The six invention of whips is ventin', on how we glide
Money on the line, wise decisions
Wild, see all the burners in the jumpers
And them niggas got off frontin', Tig' Woods style
Hands is ready, machetes, ice pick
Five dollar killas, that'll run up in ya villa..
Blaow, you wild, yeah, dress my niggas proper
Buy 'em a helicopter Friday, Wednesday got locked up
Call all the associates up, I need a new valor Monday
They got me in the jail that I copped
What up, more expensive sea glasses, jean jackets
Peep the unique fashions, street ammo, let the heat handle
Smooth, one of the illest fleets
Ice Water/Vocab, about to take over the streets, what?


Aiyo, now what's fuckin' wit us?
For all the gun holders and drugs, now what's fuckin' wit us?
For all the ones holdin' snubs, what's fuckin' wit us?

For all the rum holders in clubs, what's fuckin' wit us?
Aiyo, fucked around and got his wig piece hit up


Aiyo... there he go again with his shit
Who give a fuck if he rich, I will yap that nigga and his bitch
Comin' through frontin', they can get it
Vivid-ness, comin' at ya'll niggas, take that, we want our paper back
We in the hood with the wolves, with the wool on
The best made put ons, with the best made goods
Stop, flocked and locked, every block, your Great Dane got shot
All you know it all looked good
Stay up, we into sprayin' niggas, straight up, pay up
Fuck playin' with 'em, hit that nigga dead or I'mma lay up
He just a new player, kid, just recognize
I've been mayor, been flippin' cribs, killed different haters




All I need is the burgundy iron, yeah the shit that shoot 50
I paint it if the shit look live
Haircuts, the team lookin' real grown-up
So many young niggas on the come up, they all got tried
Rock vibe, a lot of niggas died
Don't start actin' like you real when your joint never bust since five
Stay high, take care of fam provide
Ride with the real, keep it on the low pro', and slide




The Butcher... Lex Leonardo..
Now what's fuckin' wit us?




Days that fly through the mist, so young and so rich
Powerful minds, the lines get intense
Wall to wall, cats in hell, so many trapped lost
Some will prevail and get clapped off in jail
Families mentally dyin', the roads is narrow
Jump out, bow and arrow, hit you with science
Huh, we've been livin' this daily
The wiz know what it is, that's why the vision is more clearly
War between money and lust, trust me, I hit enough dust
Suade fronts, color schemes, truck rings, stuck kings
Suade fronts, Balley's and blunts
Living amongst thieves, all we did was robbin', we won, Marvin


Hey baby, what you no good? (That's right lord)
And trusted and back with, it's me I want
(Niggas gotta cut this faggot millennium shit out right now)
War is hell (War is hell, and get real with life)
And will it be (start teachin' ya'll brothers, man)
When will people start gettin' together again



Baby, you know there's a lot of love between us
Sometimes that love goes bad
But other times it's so right!
Yeah, I know we've been through some rough waters
But most of the time our thing is off the hook!
I just want to know one thing...

What child is this
You've laid to rest
At my feet?
This is not the time
I know that I'm not responsible
It's white so it can not be mine

No, this, this is Christ the King
With a feeling of relief
I can not sing

Haste, haste to bring him, Lord
The Babe, the Son of Mary
Mmmmm, Son of Mary!
(Son of Mary)

Little bitty baby!
(Mary)

So, bring him incense, gold, and myrrh
Come peasant king to own Him
The King of kings, salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

Raise, raise the song on high
The Virgin sings her lullaby
Joy, joy, for Christ is born
The Babe, the Son of Mary

Son of Mary
(Son of Mary)

Little bitty baby
(Little bitty baby, yeah)

I'm gonna lay you down by the yule log
I'm gonna gonna love you right
Baby, I'm gonna deck your halls
And silent your night!

You'll hear the herald angels sing
When I'm sliding off your bra
I just can't wait to jingle your bells
And fa la la your la!
(Fa la la your la)

This, this is Christmas Day
A time for lovers to celebrate
I'm gonna ding dong you merrily on high
Because this is the season for giving!
(Give it to me baby, give it to me baby)

...Season for giving
(Season for giving, give me love!)

...Season for living
(Season for living, give me love!)

...Season for giving
(Season for giving)

...Giving you love
(Give me love!)

...Giving you good love
(Season for good love!)

...Whole lotta love

(Season for giving)

...You've got toes
(Give me love!)

...Whole lotta loving
(Season for good love!)

...Love
(Give me love!)

...Jingle bells
(Season for giving, give me love!

...Fa la la your la
(Season for good love, give me love!)

Son I just slapped my bitch
Came to my crib 'bout half past six
Kid's in shitty diapers, no food was fixed
I was like, "Yo bitch - why ain't no food fixed?"
She on the phone with her friend talkin bout dick
I snatched the receiver from that bitch like CLICK
She got all excited, tryin to throw fit
Swung at me then I swung back - BITCH!


What you in fo'? It happened in the club
With some thugs I was at the bar, smokin bud, hollerin at love
Ladybug was playin in my peachfuzz, she was
Talkin hot fudge, can't nobody do it like she does
In the hot tub - didn't know her man was in the club
And honey dove never mentioned that she had a scrub
It must have been the drugs or the alcohol buzz, had me
Shootin my game like a thirty-eight snub baby
Let's cut a rug, that's when I felt a shove
What the blood, dude actin like he won the Golden Gloves
I get one for holdin grudge, but if this kid throw a slug
I'mma throw a slug - that's how we be rollin cuz
I see this dud tryin to play me like a pair of Lugz
Big John Stud, Goldschlager in a golden mug
What you in fo'?

.. {*jail interlude*} ..


I'm locked down for tryin to hold my block down since a shorty
The Old Earth was like, "Street put the Glock down"
I was raised in slums, love how the gun sounds
And now I got one - c'mon, who wanna front now?
Sunup to sundown, ready for showdown
Whoever wanna throw down, the gangsters better slow down
Wake up, before you be in a cell with forty of us
(What you in fo'?) In for murder over money love and lust
(What you in fo'?) In for life, don't let me tell you twice
I might bang you twice and take double the life
What you in fo'?


Jail status - get up
Wash a nigga mattress faggot, you heard about me right?
Pass off them packages cat, you gotta eat to live
Meet the crib; got a hundred starvin niggas in here big
So pop off, drugs that's props, bring in
Glocks we call 'em oxes
Be a real live nigga, swing mops and shit, take over shit
Fuck the C.O.'s, aiyyo Boo, I need clothes
Slide brokers where phones get hid
Fuck with Russians and Latins
The most powerful marble black slipper style
Goin out thrashin niggas, kicks get thrown
Big sizes, sleep in your boots, 4000 rugged F Troops
Notarized wigs, lay six months
That's alright dog, make it home Lord
Heard you admit it in the box, slid it under walls
Bang monster anger
Bop through the halls with bangers
Live God like the Abbot of all chambers..

.. {*jail interlude*} ..

(Where do I start?) Let's see what they wanna hear?


Let me see where I start at
Hood cats are part of where it started at
We hustle hard to keep the sharks fed
For the score, go to war like a Jarhead
New York! New York! New York! New York! New York!
New York! New York! New York! New York! New York!
(We're gonna take you all on a little trip to New York City)
(With her first "Hello"...)


Uh, got a lot of heart, best part is I'm clever too
Hand skills, hard work, gun play, whatever; do
Ecstasy, oxy, Vicodin, powder
Ari, Haze, Diesel, Sour
Dust juice, loosies, turbans, kufis
Hand guns is petite, the shotties is doofy
Telling in is not nice, a lot of niggas got life
Everything is good in my bank except cocked dice
Harlems, Jordans, the hood can't afford them
So they bootlegged them, now everybody sport them
Dorms, cells, packages, mail
Warrants, bails, everything's real now


(Hi-Tek! Hi-Tek!)
(Papoose! Pap-poose!)


All I got is my word and my nuts; man, I got Brooklyn in my balls
So you could see Bed-Stuy if you lookin' in my drawers
Always talking about "you balling;" look, you want to ball?
Word on the streets: niggas is ready to put you on the wall
You just a leg shooter, you aim your gun low
I shoot my TEC high--I keep a high TEC like the producer
Pap rip the desi 'til that clip is empty
Man, I have black buried in the cemetery
Go ahead, get your fetti, but you better tell, homes
Messing with me, you'll get black-buried like a cell phone
Punks pay dues, not me, I pay attention
Call it "New York" cause we keep reinventin'




Who flipped the vocabulary? Shadow my adversaries
Bust them like a capillary
Roaches and rats on every
Corner when it's warmer, but New York is used to that already
Manhattan built those cemeteries where the blacks is buried
I take the Staten ferry, I walk the broad way
I talk to chicks along the way with John Fort
Used to do this all day, burning in the project hallways
Discussing strategies in the court case
I rock The North Face, cold like winter
I'm from Brooklyn like the Decept and lowlife niggas were
Fuck the talking, this a New York thing we aboard
But, all things considered, we all kings--what


(My nigga, my nigga, what up?)
(Tek, you did it again, nigga)
(Word up, I love that)


Hey-yo, yo, I rhyme for the streets; broke niggas rap on they feet
So angry as hell, we yell from the beats
"Wise killers up in New York, who lay for peace
Crime action get you trapped by the chiefs, no peace, see?"
Proud and have the hood style and good talent
Most of us fell off from drug wars, trying to re-up; the law whilin
Can't get no rest, the vest is on, stress pilin'
Scheming on something green with eagles on it, Chef found it
While I take a trip back, our first little pack
Had to open doors no time for broads I was scopin crack
Baggin like a newborn, barely profit beef pop off
We carry tommy guns and smoke trees and grab pockets
Pilgrimage life, real like with no money and no white
I had this white girl who work for me wipin pipe
Livin by the sword, a hundred niggas daily
Who get on board and kill for some proper live on them acres board

 (*Sample) (**New York Sample)
Let me see where I started at
Hood cats are part of where it started at (**New York)
We hustle hard to keep the sharks fear
For the score go to war like a jarhead (**New York)
New York, New York, New York, New York, New York!!!




Let's go, kid


Something's in the attic, drugs on me, thugs gettin'
Bubbly, let's pop, surround the block, looking lovely
Extra nine glindin' on me, women who barely know me
Swarm me, faggots try to front, blow me
Aiyo, I'm from the soul bluntly, we in them H2's coolin'
Want me, try to kill a kid, bring your country
Son's nice with rifles, white fools, white dudes
Jumpin' out, fed jackets, dare you to bump me
A glow like Willie Bostic, I do the knifework job, yeah
Rappers sprint, clap 'em, this is our 'jects
Who taught ya'll niggas, it was the kid with the tarantula
Tinted up, extortin' ya'll monthly
Crabs in a bucket, rap, fuck it, yo, go get your handgun
I'd rather shoot yo' ass in public, you ain't a Air Force boss
You a hoster, frontin' like me on your poster
Now ya'll niggas fuckin' with my ones
We need to battle for cattle, acts, boats, art and crafts
Scalpals, thumb rings, dick, be careful
Fuckin' with Staten Island's heartless
Son of all flames, God guard frames, catch me with the Starks kid
The authentic Ghost, we on the golf course, with rentin' boats
Eagles on, feastin' with bigger GOATs
Come take it in blood, dare any thug to re-up
What, we gon' keep it on the hush


In the clubs, where you at?
In the clubs, where you at?
Open paperchasing, on the low getting trapped


Aiyo, drove into the water like bait, the ocean was dark
The moon lit, swimmin' to the bottom to get to the sink
We on niggas, and we comin' boy, talk with ya gun
Me, I'm ready, and I'm ready with cake, yea
Flawless, more powerful horses, the kid flow naucious
Everybody gettin' weeded, we all for this
Armored tank style, moving in ranks
Hundred that'll rock for me, still kill you, over your men bitch
Skiing in Alaska, half the man, half Casper
Runnin' with wolves, the bulls look nastier
Silencer, each is thee least, will kill on Easter
Ya'll gon' get it, wait til we get creased up
Nothin' but, rapid fire, livewire, brand new trees
Burn 'em up, they respectin' your street, cousin
We gon' bring it to every label, pay attention, ya'll
Cuban is back, now put that on a glass table






Hey, you, jump in this ride
It's real nice, and slippery inside
Wise, guy come get this pie
Ride it in style
Said it a minute ago, I did it a minute ago
I drop it, I pick it up slow, I want it, I'm kicking it though
Cause they know that I got that good shit
Said I'm bad, but I could be a good bitch


Squeeze my body, rock my body
Boy, you make me go
"Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na," me go
Please my body, heal my body
Boy, you make me go
"Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na," me go
We gon'...


Hey, stranger over there
I'm really liking that way you whip it, whip it
Yeah, I want you everyday
You're so right, you're so tight
You got my world spinning, you got my world spinning
My head goes round and around, r-round and around
And I'm thinking if we could be
Stranger, what you say?
I'm really liking that way you whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it (uh!)


"Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na," me go
"Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na," me go


Is that my cue?
I'm looking for some brain to boost my IQ
I'm like 5'2", my SAT scores was high too
But I don't wanna brag I Louis Vuitton bagged him
Hopped out the jag proceeded to shag-shagged him
Slim, trim, also light skin
So Pe-Pe-Peter put the pipe in


Squeeze my body, rock my body
Boy, you make me go
"Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na," me go
Please my body, heal my body
Boy, you make me go
"Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na," me go

My head goes round and around, r-round and around
And I'm thinking if we could be
Stranger, what you say?
I'm really liking that way you whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it (uh!)


"Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na," me go
"Na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na," me go

Made me mad, in the Blazer we all cramped
Six deep, four bags of cheeba, a crisp beat
All I need to show you now is a sick Jeep


Eighty-four mopeds, blue and white Pro-Keds
Just started puff'n, got instructions from an old head
Co-ved, wally rock'n niggas tryna grow dreads
Back in the bush, Church Ave on the juxs
Shell toes, black and white, no laces in 'em
Pat U-edition had his whole face in 'em
Straight leg denims, Taylor made shit
Kareem Laker colors, low cut suede tip
Stay dipped, Stan Smith lay sick
Two-toned colors, put the taps on the rubber
Puma rockin' nigga, fuck a womber I was bigger
See a bitch in seconds an assumed that I could rip her
None hipper, copped kicks with the zippers
The Filas arrived, it was Levis and high
In V Tracks I was simply the mack
Everything I snatched had to match with the hat
Reebok rocker, whole crew couldn't knock us
Fuck who, only thing to do was just Glock us
Valley Competitions and the Jordans hit stores
I'm sitting reminiscing, T. La Rock it's yours
Now fast forward time nigga still on the grind
Haters everywhere, nigga still gotta shine
Guccis all kinds, switch 'em up for the weather
Louis' in lime, Only do it for the pleasure
Come fresher, from the tech on the dresser
Fifth in the waist, still crys'd and I'm laced


Niggas, And I do it for real you dig
You know, I still rock the Gor-Tex and Tims when necessary
Other then that, Bogary low cuts the minimum
Or I do the Italian Classic Olympic cut Guccis
Three quarters, you bum ass niggas




Forget White Castle, let's go get some pussy
Huh
Fucking sausage fest in here bros
Let's go get us some poon tang
Then we'll go to White Castle
Look Neil you don't understand
We've been craving these burgers all night
Yah I've been craving burgers too
Fur burgers



In case you thinking I'm trying to pull some of that old time nigga shit on you captain
I think you ought to know something
I hired the very best killers there are
White killers
White ones baby
So you better take good care of me
Nothing better happen to one hair on my gorgeous head
Can you dig it




Snatch the bitch wig off, give up that pussy, ho, get off
We taking that, Benjamin Franklin pussy, blinking that
C.C.B., Barbara Streisand, Cali sisters in the right hand
Rip the shirt off, had a nice pair
Twelve o'clock, afternoon boom, fucking from room to room
Enough to zoom, ten minute a wound, I comfort this
Stark confronting her, hello, miss-miss, come out the Tyra bra, miss
Marvelous, awesome bitch, out as a rich
Fly groupie bitch, crazy cum color, Penela' swiss piss
Dirty burst on her, wipe his dick on her lips
Slow the fuck down Rich, half his wrist up in the uterus
She spoke, "I'm tellin' Louis Rich", Max, shoot the bitch
Rollie was rooting this, Goldie hardly spoke, shit was ludicrous
She bit his dick, God wilded on her with a kick
Bobby stressed out, just like life is like a lighter
Lit a gal' on her, boo, stop wilding, for real, lighten up
For Noodles caught a lapdance, pussy clap-clap just like a tapdance
Let her fuck you on your head, go to bed
Delrio the Leo, hot pelepeno, lace a Gambino nigga, right
Wash knobs for free, though, only me though
Hah, polishing wax floors, she's a real whore
Keep it raw, you break law? My cousin Blake break jaws
We all raw, broke bitch, try to come aboard
Snort on the right, ho, now right as a core
I'm only fucking ya'll, cuz ya'll on, keeping my legs strong
You dead wrong, talking that shit, giving me head wrong
Sextress, dress ya ass off, bullshit necklace
Here, rock this robe, if you lose it, death wish
More head, we all getting feds, forget
Down the lamb spread, buying the right bread, Nike head
Dike head, married a white dread
Drive a snow white five, died in the air, swallowing white shit
Whores, they never listen, what? The girl's a whore
Come on..




No that nigag didnt come out of a motherfuckin balloon in the air

Crazy, B, crazy
Ah man, its this nigga Rae right here, right
Yeah, 2013 bullets, huh?
Thats what Im talkin about
Real


Fly down to Vegas and fuck, drop a half a mil
Table it up, silks cable it up
Im from the grain, entertainers get scooped and trapped
Pull a navy blue Uzi out and roof your Lac
Crap table, King, Black Jack, gangsters with chains on
69 blue jean denims, OJs on
Relax, blunts on me, black weed gritty
Parlay with the wrangler posse in the city, yo
Overdose confidence, gun in the console, concord jet to the Congos
Bagging everything up, swag on a million, blindfold
Cant see nothing I wear, fronting out here
They ask me how Im eating, I be hunting out here, yeah
Godzilla rap and them labels
Hugh blow fiend, heron don, Levis is plainclothes
So many rings plus surrounded by kings
Sitting back in the fourth row, examining Queens
They like Chef, yo, you built for it meet at the Biltmore
Any violations I agree to get killed for it
Wheres the real rap? Niggas is lost now
Hmm, how much it cost now to marry it up?
Divorce it, blaow, extortion style
Shoot the first nigga who talk, you lost your style
My next album might be called The Wild
Wolverines, bears and whales, no snails
Foxes, good Great Danes, thats all, he Cale
Kill all the rats, for real
They live in the hoods
They all come out convinced to sell
Little clothes niggas is frail
Cause when he rap its like poisonous lines thats rich
Mix together virgin blood and gallons of piss, yo
The real lowdown in the midst
I come like Sandy in the middle of the year like Christmas
Kango, Santa skully, emerald green
Rockin dark green Wallabies, blowing the beam
On the go, yo, bowling for cream
And Ill be here for the next ten years for the team


Yo, oh shit
Pacquiao just got knocked the fuck out by Marquez, nigga
Oh shit




Yeah (whadup)
Another, another my nigga


We that cold weather
Sunk in the tent
Phone Valetta had the sweater
Paid 9 grand, on call machete
Fascinating in gun fights, wallabies is Chris
It's like a fresh new rhyme on the disk
Cut niggas like Zorro
Bullhorn gaff the borough that's Staten
New Brighton hell niggas, what's happening?
Harbor where the gangsters live
Stapleton, Smooth Willie's
All of us fly high
Peace to my goon Gilley
Chef, criminals have to eat ferocious
Six wheels, Maybach black, blowing on roaches
The empire is built from the ground up
I come around, what?
You get nothin' now
Stand there all frowned up
The emperor especially in buildings
Got a temper
No money coming slapping
Something down, it's suspenders
Now back to my shorty at hand
How you want it?
What's the plan?
Just be cool
Converse with your man


So many things I'm going through
So much that I wanna do
It's starting to become so clear to me
Tomorrow ain't really guaranteed
So many days I've thought of you
It's about time you knew the truth
Got to act quickly you and I
We fall in love
So many reasons why


Why don't we?
Why don't we?
Why don't we?
Why don't we?
Why don't we fall in love?


Why don't we fall in love?
It's so many reasons
It's the only thing that lies to me


It takes such a load off to let you know
That you're the only one
I never want to go
Things I never did
Now I want to do
And love I never felt
Now I feel for you
Why?
I want to just swallow
Each and every ounce of my pride
Everything you do
I wanna feel again
Ain't no use for us to pretend




Come with me
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed




Yo, Yo, What the fuck is goin on niggas
Word up, We comin for all them fuck bets man


You wig splashed frontin, I know the science
You can't con a convict, Watch niggas
Rock all around the clock with it
Post it up on these grounds
We block niggas don't fuck around


I dropped lines that became a motherfuckin anthem
Blood shed, Gloatin for the Phantom
The arms dangle off the stretcher
Oxygen masks's worthless for real
Done deal, It's closed curtain
The barrel of my gun still smoke'n
Niggas be frontin like they G'd down Wu, Stop joke'n
Welcome to the state called crime
Ground call Syndicate, Fat whips and long clip
When this cat spit it's on bitch
Nigga I'm dangerous as fuck
Profane languages, My slang ya get touched
And barrels where sick niggas serve powder
Now um, Spent they whole live in cells, Never turn coward
Black clouds shade on the city
Beware the Phantom loose, No block is bulletproof
Slugs tumble'n from metal bananas
Burners we slant em, Scarface Tony Montana's


You wig splashed frontin, I know the science
You can't con a convict, Watch niggas
Rock all around the clock with it
Post it up on these grounds
We block niggas don't fuck around


Ratchet's get to clackin
Yellow tape'n numbers on the asphalt
Mom's cryin, The silence is beaten
Little kids stay in the crib, It's hotter then a motherfucker
Homicide rugged still dumpin with some head bustas
Bandana swagger, Them hammers will melt your bones, It's on
The scent of death is in the air, It's block war
I ain't over reckless I'm grantin niggas a death wish
Get X'd, Watch your movements, We ain't cool bitch, Nah
This ain't checkers it's chess, Checkmate, Inspect pase'n
No safety, Paint up your rest, I ain't got no patience
Splack your asshole, Some motion picture, Goul's affliction
Niggas tied in on some mob shit, My goons'll get ya
Cats gettin too loose, Set examples
Shoot the shit out that man right there
And let yall faggot niggas know we ain't the one to cross
We boss, Don't get it twisted
Get your kick and your hardware yall fuck niggas


You wig splashed frontin, I know the science
You can't con a convict, Watch niggas
Rock all around the clock with it
Post it up on these grounds
We block niggas don't fuck around


I seen it calm before, Lying on the floor
Paramedics tryin but he expired for sure
Fuckin with the wrong cats done it
Wave you outta your place
Damn he thirteen, Handed rattle snakes
Layin in the jungles of concrete
Waitin on the next victim
Fuck rap, Macks and techs spittin
Hatch in the back in the Lex liftin
Forever Mya reppin for projects and prisons
Poppin seven hundred dollar bottles of Coogi White
The champagne cost a fortune
Sky's the limit when we celebrate
Ties with killers, Niggas sellin cake
Jewels, Bananas come'n out of Jake
Even though we stay fly, Nothin sweet but the cologne
We marry the streets in holy matrimone
Never take this ring off my finger
The block'll get jealous of course
Now I'm smile'n at your corpse


You wig splashed frontin, I know the science
You can't con a convict, Watch niggas
Rock all around the clock with it
Post it up on these grounds
We block niggas don't fuck around

Don't take it per-son-al.. it's only mu-sic
Holla at me.. yo! Yo!
Ice Water! Yo.. yo


Try me, P.C.'ll put a clip in a nigga
Fuck a hole, my bullets'll dig a ditch in a nigga
Listen, I've been reppin', only pack big weapons
One shot to the stomach, you missin' ya midsection
I'm off the wall, dog, I could off ya balls
Stick his ass to the rooftop, toss 'em off
Hit the Ave with the rooftop off the porch
I get money cuz it costs to floss, nigga you feelin' me?
And if not then fuck what you gotta deal with me
I've only been here for a minute but haters wanna get rid of me
P.C. creep with at least three heats
And a shotgun stashed underneath the backseats


Niggas actin' like you don't feel a draft
You seen ya man? Tell him I'mma kill his ass
And I don't, wanna talk I want a mill in cash
I come through 'tards shittin', lookin' ill in the past
Cuz it's the, Ice Water, don't get it confused
And one false move'll cause me to spit at you dudes
It's Stumic, motherfucker and I'm pickin' ya food
And ain't no one out you know that my niggas'll do you
Let's spit on 'em, rush these niggas
And crush several fuckin', will leave a dent out ya liver
Only kid in the hood with a mustard ninja
Heard you broke down good, well I fucked ya sister


Eh yo we Wyld in Da Club, style in the club
This is for my niggas gettin' down in the club
At the bar throwin' down rounds in the club
Talk slick and get the four pound in ya mug


Yo I keep my gun on me, what the fuck y'all want from me?
Y'all touch my property somebody gon' die, uh-huh
This ain't no joke, it's for real
My niggas they totin' they steel
All it takes a phone call and they ready to ride
Get ready to die


Eh yo the cards are dealt, the words are spoken
Nigga, welcome to the Hell, the gates is open (uh-huh)
Gatekeeper, first degree murder through the speaker
Who deep enough to flow with the reaper?
Stuck in the middle, I spit a little riddle
Leavin' niggas crippled, my niggas ball 'em like Kerry Kittles
You niggas makin' it hard, it's really kinda simple
If a nigga gotta pull it out I'm puttin' it in ya temple


Official I do this, rude maneuver
I use the Rugers to keep the bullets movin' through ya
Weak anatomy, fuck the small talk and flattery
Ya power is weak, to beef you need much more batteries
Keep it genetic, or dead it, Ice Water Inc. we said it
Whoever so-called did it or said it, promote it and spread it
Fake it or front it, get ambushed and confronted
With slugs in ya head, back, chest and stomach
Niggas don't want it or ask for it, so we give it to 'em
Dead in the club and let them things spit and rip through 'em dead in the club
Is you gon' fuck around and be the nigga dead in the club?
(Yeah? Uh-huh..)




Egyptian look, gazelles on, L's lit, this how it's goin' down
Ski mask, Chanel shit, move like a terrorist click
Nineteen eighties babies, worldwide, ya girl on our dick
All you know is Rae look good, he hood
Envision the flips, I make money like them niggas who take money
Fresh out the can, Duran look, Astro van
The ill Castro, rap Son of Sam
More Rugers, more bow and arrows
Still no losers, forty five dollars ahead
Go at niggas shootin' lyrical leads
Stop absorbin, break shit, knock that gay shit out ya head





 + (samples)
(Make me yours) He get out of line, break his fucking arm...
You know how it go (What am I supposed to say? Yeeaaah)
You know, word up, not playing the games, with these niggas, man
(Somebody tell me what do I do...)
None at all, man... hit 'em off, none of that, man


Aiyo, jump out the Acura, crazy heavy, what's popping?
Us locking the game, word to every hand on the locman
Street gwop, everybody eats, sweep blocks
This is a message, ain't go no grams, we gon' beatbox
Study like lessons, niggas in the game biting the grain
You knowing where it came from, stop it
You thought we wasn't coming? You dumbing, you blunted again
Watch Lex get that dough out ya pocket, rhyme all 'pallegic
Can't nothing move when I rhyme, when I drop lines it's law out in Egypt
Love ups, don't need no batteries now, what?
The only niggas that'll glow'll be us
Yo, throw me in Sin City, leave me with the vultures and bats
Then give me two weeks to bubble like Kim titties
Dirt Dog, we miss you, now it's time to murder the game
Cuz if things change, you know it ain't against Wu


What am I supposed to say? Yeeaaah
Somebody tell me what do I do...


We keep it hot, keep the heat on the block
We never stop, drawing water up until it begin to drop
Raining with the patchwork of puzzles
That was written in the year of the dragon
More raw than you could ever imagine
How much of a great blessing to a rap city
Where the youth is organically fed, from the Witty
Unpredictable, Talent And Natural Game is lyrical
Analyze the picture, the portrait, the visual
A Cuban Link Chef cooks spaghetti that's untied
RAGU nigga whose tomatoes are sundried
He gave y'all niggas whiplash from bling bling
But my rhyme'll give ya hot flash and moodswings
Math shed light on divine secrets, then science leaked it
For the lower level creatures that can't peep it
I observe MC's, regardless
From a neighboring world which is ten times the sharpness...




Let the track wind and ya mind flow free
Remain conscious on this ride to ya best ability
Infinity, back to the source of which it came
Energy, see it change forms, atoms being born, never ending
On and on and on and, travel with me
Not trying to convince the pack, that it's a fact
For those who can't adapt, I lived it, shitted it back
We have agreed, you'll feel the impact of the truth when I'll squeeze
The brain feels something pop, hip hop, locked in texts
Fat checks, fly whips, jewelry, chicks
Enough kicks, fitted crown, buttoned down
Underneath the white T lies the four pound
This is forty-five minutes of menacing
Dismantling, any MC opponent stepping in the zone
Get ya face blown (Get ya face blown)




Observe the word, when I speak, get the truth's heard
True to the curb, Wu classic is the new birth
Spreading the blessing across seven continents
Arm of the trench, there's no form of defense
Entertainment, nine swords swing rapid
Check the techniques, first bow to The Abbott
Witty Unpredictable, gritty individual
Valid, if it's Actual, Talent and it's Natural
Game, rugged like the train, pump it in ya vein
I and I ride or die under the name
W-U, the primary, ya secondary
Definitely not necessary, the legendary
You printed the blueprints to do this shit
Moving the youth in the bricks
Spit poison tipped darts that rip hearts
Through the chest, when I manifest my sick art


Speaking my mind, fall in line when I spit mine
Still in my prime, still'll shine til it quit time
If this is a crime, find me guilty, I'm so sublime
So rapid with rhymes, sayin' I'm slacking is assonine
Revealing the truth, catching feelings, it's still the Wu
Gorilla the booth, body armored, them killa proof
In living proof, I'm the Wittiest Unpredictable
Most Talented rap muthafucker you ever listened to


I'm a hustler, I grind til my pack is done
Give a seed mad knowledge til they crack and run
Can't nobody fuck with me, I'm just too nice
Smack niggas in they head everytime I write
Yo, I'm straight from Park Hill where the guns is popping
Where them little black kids do they grocery shopping
Go to school fucked up, it's Africa Island
We poor in the bricks but inside it's nothing but talent




It's on {Where your sparkle at kid?}
(RZArector)


Yes the shit is raw coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, "Wu-Tang's back for more"
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)


This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
X Y  slam Nine Diagram pole
Raekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback Notre Dame
Golden Arms is bronze Buddha palm hit Qu'ran
It blows extreme, mainstream be the theme, supreme team
America's Cream Team, redeemed
Vidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone
Gun POW to the dome and split the bone
Wig blown off the ledge by the alleged
Full-fledged, sledge RZA edge
One dose of my feroc' handheld trigger cuts
A capella spitting shell paralyse if you get touched
And critical mic cords, hanging like umbilical
Cords, dope swords, five star general
Raw be the quote rap style sore throat
Through the fully operational, handheld totem




A hundred thousand times one, snatch up my styles get done
I hold a title, and here's how my belt was won, check it
Slick majestic, broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew through lack of effort
You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes
My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
Masked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords
And his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines
With more gains than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains
Poisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this
You get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this
Side effects of hot raps and hot tracks
A duffel bag full of guns son, dipped in black
My culture, glides and attacks you like a vulture
Ghostface in Madison Square is on your poster




Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy show it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
Of the Wu and learnt how to
Fuck up your anatomy steadily, calm and deadly
Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit
MCs submit to the will as I kill your
Juvenile freestyle, civilize the mental
Devils worship this like an icon
Bear-hugging mics with the grips of a python




You heard other raps before but kept waiting
For the Son of Song, I keep dancehalls strong
Beats never worthy of my cause, I prolong
Extravaganza, time sits still
No propaganda, be wary of the skill
As I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum
Dedicated to rap nigga, beware of the fearsome
Lebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat
CD massacre, murder to cassette
I blow the shop up, you ain't seen nothing yet
One man ran, tryna get away from it
Put your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh
Into your chamber like Freddy enter dream
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause, like a black jack to dat
You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertaining motherfuckers can't stop O
In battling, you don't want me to start tattling
All up on the stage cause y'all snakes keep rattling
Bitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you wanna clock me like Sherry
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry
Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in, and get ten dollars back
The fat LP with Cappachino on the wax
Pass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LPs back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt and dial 9-1-7
1-6-0-4-9-3-11
And you could get long dick hip-hop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction
I'm Staten Island best son, fuck what you heard
Niggas still talking that shit is absurd
My repertoire, is U.S.S.R
P.L.O. style got thrown out the car
And ran over by the Method Man Jeep
Divine can't define my style is so deep
Like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy
Like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind
Cause you weak in the knees like SWV
Tryna get a title like Wu Killa Bee
Kid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbott
Me and RZA rhyme name printed in the tablet
Under vets, we paid our debts for mad years
Hibernate the sound and now we out like bears
In Born Power, born physically, power speaking
The truth in the song be the pro-black teaching




No man all bitches are the same, just like my hoes, you know
I keep em broke, wake up one morning with some money
They're subject to go crazy you know?
I keep em lookin good, pretty and all that, you know, but no dough
When I get a bitch, I got a bitch (right on)


Word up
Got motherfucking brother wise
You know what I'm saying? Teaching the uncivilized
Yeah, runnin the streets, you know it's deep
Word up, check his technique, yeah
I be Ghostface, flippin the marvelous track
Yeah, you know the steelo, but yo, yo

Check the banging-est sounds that I invent
Fake niggas who tried to flex hard came and went
They couldn't match up with the fly nigga with his back against the wall
Heads clocked once I came in the door
I played the speaker, sipping a Kahlua
Saw this bad bitch wit a switch and yo, I had to step to her
In a manner, and rather wished the current was warm
When I had reached her, I looked and knew the shit was on
Peace, excuse me, allow to introduce myself
Yo, I'm the man, and honey, you've been rated top shelf
Yo, what's your name hon, hair wrapped up in a bun
Your eyes sparkle, just like glass in the sun
Never diss 'em, it's hard for a nigga just to miss 'em
Especially, when you're browsing, going fishing
Your waistline, banging like a bassline
Physical form is well complex
And yo, I love your outline, boo
Your whole body is wild, with your rugged profile
Enough to make a hard rock smile
You can't strike out, tell me what can really go wrong
You're rocking labels - Tommy Hil, down to Claiborne
Show me some love hon, show me some love boo
Show me the vibe and I'll be more than glad to shoot it through
A-yo peep it, I know you love Victoria's Secret
And loving all the marvelous slang on how I freak it
Plus, see you're the type to make a nigga crash
Far from trash, your flesh is way softer than a baby's ass
Your body lotion is the potion
The shit got me open like dust and yo, your stee is Thai potent, yo
We can go the distance, I put you under wings
From this convo we can spark and see whatever brings
I walked the hot Arabian desert, barefooted
I grabbed your hair, you grabbed my joint and knew where to put it

Word up, yo, straight up and down yo
Check the joint, baby
It be the Wu-Tang production
Yeah, yeah, and all types of shit, and brothers catching repercussions
Yo, straight up



I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means

(Verse 1)
I guess that's when I'll walk in a chill
Grab a Phil, wipe the ashes off my leather pants, the vest is just lambskin
I'm the real Muhammad Ali style in the Phil
You know it, (?)'s my clique, Italianos
Walk through the door few deep, roll a leaf
Whoever want it, just sign up, I won't even beef
Ninjaz with heart, the payouts, the city is chaos
I'm feeling you, now go and make a move, he killing you
Searching for the big rainbow wearing a Kangol and a raincoat
Jump with the .45, it's Django
Flying in a new (?),, missing my man
You got a Christy in the can where you destined
They see the young cub come up, drop a bracelet through your burpees
Stay under the radars, no attorneys
Yeah gangster, stay gangster, made from Kingston
I wish real niggas would say something
Glorified getting it, guns on us, tons of trust
Few niggas in the slums is us, but hate being here
Just meeting here, thinking it's sweet in here
'Til niggas take your head off for creeping here
Far from the curb to the jails
I write poems to flip tails, and letters to judges to get deals
I miss the good days, you know, the hood days
Now we sit in mansions on good grades
The moments is raw, baller's is poor
Run with your boy, light and blow a blunt if you're bored
Take a flash when the (?), them niggas was ashy
Dreaming on the benches, don't bash me
Crying, letting the tears dry, no one I'm trying
Society rubbing me when I'm eying, where the love at
With war fears, hit the beers, just wait
Come up with a plan to hit a bank, what

I feel it's time we should cake up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh, baby, when we're together
Breaking our cheddar

I feel it's time we should cake up, baby
I feel it's time for us to split that together
And make the best of things, oh, baby, when we're together
Breaking our cheddar

I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means

And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people we ever greeted
And I'm hoping on all the days to come and days to go
And I'm hoping on days of loving you so

I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a star, whoa-oh
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see

I'm wishing on a star, whoa-oh
I'm wishing on a star, whoa-oh
I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are




One day Joe asked me, ya know what I mean
"Would you, would you get on a joint with Pun?"
Ya know what I mean, on the strength, I'm like
"Hell yeah the kid got talent"
Ya know what I mean
So, our first joint we did together was Fire Water, and that was Pun's introduction to the game... he murdered the joint




Uh, First off, no I ain't soft
Eeny meeny, any one of you will get broke off
Sayin' you the truth nigga look like false
Just talk too much and you look like narcs
More than the king look up to the gods
In my own lane your shit garbage, my shit poppin' your shit Amish
I been grindin', no other option
We ain't even started, still the beginning
Tell them this my shot with a lime and a lemon
It's no more limits it's ho's in my linen
Theres holes in your story you been telling for a minute
Been all round the city never seen you in it
Back then with a 4X tee and a fitted, riddin' in a bucket but I paid for that shit
Still got it, just dropped thirty K in that bitch
Blunt long as an AK, sprayin' in this bitch
Same nigga since day 1, you gay nigga' switch
When the dough start coming tell em' live is a risk
Talkin' bout bars got life get a grip





I said work's never over, money gettin' older
Never see me walking with a chip on my shoulder
Show price going up, every single quarter
Got you nigga's cornered, call the fuckin' coroner
Out of town, all the time, I'm a foreigner
In a foreign girl, I can transform ya
Reppin' that West side California
Make a wrong turn, your chain in the pawn shop
Streets ain't playin', nigga's back on they bullshit
Better find an OG and get to payin' dues bitch
I said I'm good in the hood yo
And you nigga's wifen hood ho's
Hold up, said hold up
Me? Nigga get ran over
Rose up from the roaches
Now I need a crib big enough to fit a boat in motha fucka




Rifles out, beard like the Russians
Octagon tub in the silk drawers, the dutches
Model that clayborne, posing in black sayin' the day gone
Swimmin trunks gold, with the suede on it
The rap version of Frank Ward, the mad cape and the sword
Home in Columbia call me a killa
Fried fish Friday's, fresh to death, waves are sideways
Blunt out, I'm ready to buy  paper bag stunna
Trench coat 40 on the throat, all I know, take money, wanna?
Besides bread max in lounges, feet up coolin'
Merlot bottles get blown by the thousands
Heard I was browsing, but I was upstairs
In the room chillin' smoking bout to blow hundred thousand
Real niggas wiling, fucking on the balcony styling, remember the family
Peace I'm out Ink




I'm wrapped up  trying to break free
I'm my own worst enemy, me
They'll never let me by though, cause I'm always tryna beat
Beat my worst enemy, me


Ayo, a better platform for all to listen to me
We out in DC deep, ain't got no sleep
The ride bumpy, who jetted out the country to buy D
Came back,  ain't nothin' sweet
My dome is yellin', "Go home!" but I ain't through
So many years in my career, it's a long route
Thinkin' when  skinned his face on the plaster
We was dusted back then, I smoked the last of it
And jumped into the Acura, sleepin' at , what it do?
Stew, beef, chicken, where my boo?
Had a quarrel with a hood rockstar, I broke his arm off
Cause he was pointin' his fingers at Ivanne's daughter
What's next? Dreads want a piece of my spot
This my crib, I pay here to live, fuck the pap




Ridin' with the gun cocked, sweatin', musty tee on
Black Timb Bs, 10, 10 degrees 
Couple Ks, some had charms
I'm strictly Eagles, few suedes on
Next Friday I'm 
I gotta kill this nigga's head
He'll prolly do mine when nobody's there
Cause the only way to score, leave no witness
A thug on my shit list, pay him to slugs back
The slickest and remember that I built two graves
I wasn't stupid, I was ruthless
Check the bazooka crew, they bookoos
Broke the glass slammin' my rings down
That's doofus, don't mess up, you got the longest clip, use it
Yo you see 'em in the lobby, they right there
Headshots only, kill him, he right there






Yo, too advanced, Digi' stance, made the CD enhanced
I move with the speed and strength of ants
Identical in form with the Bees they swarm
Hold up, the cold current appear warm
My first verbal brawl, started on some yes yes y'all
To the beat y'all, break your windshield, your jeep stall
Mr. Traffic, dumbin shit, from ecclesiastic
Cashier, holdin out, fine, cut off the plastic
See the logo? A monument in hip-hop
Carved out, in the giant landscape of broken rocks
Whether heard in herb spots, jukebox or malt shops
Uncut live, drop eighty-five, in one shot
Spotlight hits the metal mic, majority stare
Heard the Wu snare, while my iris cut down the glare
Walk a road the great length you find too long to measure
My Clan'll make me rhyme like D. Banner under pressure
No surprise, double disc touched five
Those elements kept environments colonized
With the high flying death-defying flow like the Rebel
Right there, but you're one light year from my level


Uh-huh.. yeah.. yo.. check it.. yo..
Bottles goin' off in the church, we broke the wine
Slapped the pastor, didn't know Pop had asthma
He pulled out his blue bible, change fell out his coat
Three condoms, two dice, one bag of dope
Oooh! Rev. ain't right, his church ain't right
Deacon is a pimp, tell by his ice
Mrs. Parks said, "Brother Starks, meet you at the numbers spot
Heard you got red tops out, and I want a lot"
Shirley fainted dead on the spot
Two ushers slipped eighty dollars right out the pot
Oh shit!


Egyptian, brown skin brown suede Timbs
Masqueradin X-rated throw blades, all occasions
Round nozzle touchdown, Haagen-Daas gobbles White House
Gucci flag on the roof, call us rock groups
Mere intelligent, buy Neimann Marcus out
No doubt, all we saw he bought, Lori mom's all blow
Was simple, blamp instrumentals run camps the stamps get you
The way we lamp, fans come and get you
Play, fullback strapped like a fuck, war at
The black, Carlo Gambino's stash house in Hackensack
Pack capsules, Green Bay 'em lay 'em down like wax do
It's all actual we build, like Crash Crew
Coconut, incense, one sentence, aiyyo
Control the holy flinch hit this, new whips
Roman numerals, sun splash them niggas like, Tango and Cash
Alcatraz cats roll out fast..


Wu thousand nuthin but hardcore
We tryin to get land riches and more
Ghost put me on to it
We just do it, floss or whatever
Take care of the business, there's too many roughnecks
Give two of these to Flex, tell him it's real rap like Ghost
Had to beat niggas with toast
Clubs V.I. clientele we lay it down flat
Pulled out on y'all kid, now where your mans at?
Fakin the real like, "Damn I can't stand Cappa'"
Then my wardrobe flooded the next chapter
Y'all heard about us like we heard about you
Bless the mic with reality, hit you with the virtue
Calm down not tryin to hurt you, burst through
That shit, fatter than all y'all niggas outfits
We the glitch like Y2K
Catch the ball when it drop, guns pop, y'all have a nice day

"Doctor Kanabuta, Iron Man, he is invincible
His remarkable armor is supreme!"


Yo, sometimes I'm liable to spaz and break fool
Grab my gun, select one, snatch son
Put the barrel by his face, blast one by his eardrum
Piss run, you drop thinkin you shot
Screamin like a bitch, kicks to your face
Shots to the body that shake like the bass
I'm Ghostfaced up, military style down
Nuff ammunitions of rounds across the chest


Skip to the intro, rap through po'
Smashed a fresh ball of wax ceasar
Flashy penthouse that overlooks the vista
Wally Moc' half tied, swimmin trunks
Three chunks of ice sit in Johnny Walker for advice
Catch the moment, fundraiser at will, work with the homeless
Polish diamond edge, Flintstone shit, sealed in a comb pick
Carefully, swing the B seven series Christmas lights
Too bright Ghost is comin y'all fix the mirrors
Relax like pudding, confidence strangle my man couldn't
Exile he no longer in the hood
Bless the kid that max the most
Me I turn a wedding into hoax
Roses tied to bombs on posts
On commercial breaks, piss in the apple juice
Rasta nigga rock the big do's
Jiffy Pop it's only chant Wu




"What we're gonna do right here is go back, way back, back into time"
"Here we go!"
"OK everybody!"
"Sing my song" "Step up to this" (Both X4)

Raid the desert, clench a camel thirst
Polish Spring breath itch


"OK everybody!"

Yo, I move like a UFO ship, a smooth prince
The eloquent stance, intelligent man, while shooting
Rhyme from the Byzantine face, with seven holes
Nuwaubian, Israelite faith, my weapon blows
Fire pearl, fugitive chased from higher worlds
Priest move through FBI states with white girls
There's benzodiazepines, sedate the culture like the Europeans
Two hundred grams of , build sculptures
Of the high proximity and fitted me pale
Paradise lost alone in this wasteland, he wears an ice cross
Lamping with the gold white Porsche, lights off
When he talks, breathe so cold you see white floss
You can see the sidewalk, you can see the white chalk
American tragedy, men who killed Malcolm
Icepick, confessions of a Mafia hitman and crime families
Brother minister, the brother's keepers
A sick grin, they cleared out the mall with street sweepers
Try to front, tell, in the hood, will bury ya
Priest sniff out beats like dogs sniff out bodies in wooded areas
Investigation, journalists on child murders
Jihad sip with serial killers, KKK and the hot burners
Every eye lurking, slay the beast when my iron emerges
Killah Priest throw fires at serpents


Prince of Persia, five fifties, most of us sly and shifty
Can't take the cake when you die, why evict me?
Diamond cut needles on the twelves, my niggas blow off the sales, come back derailed
I speak with the strength of power sour, black reefer and flowers
Build me a palace in Egypt, I own McDonald's
Cranberry grenades, hood parade
Make sure my peoples safe, send the US the cure for AIDS
Everybody know my portfolio, Gucci sneakers on
Looking real, yo, this is my polio
Bro man with the gold lamb, gold glam
Show his hand off, I got the Scorpio in sand
Brand new rebels, rolled up, keeping it pulled up
Snatch your kilt, sipping African milk
My levels, is more higher then them devils
Check me in another ghetto, the circle



Wu-Tang! (x16)




Yo, there's a rumor that an inmate heard
Salesman hiring, a convict of murder
Bodyguard, he used to use physical fitness
His business, catching and terrifying the witness
In the gym is where he gained his powers
Boss was the pizzeria owner that rolled flour
A made man, it felt good to be made
Turned murderer, extremely quick to upgrade
But he still baked pies and his cake would rise
Like his enemy, he watched to take dives
Allies would retaliate, at least even the score
Had a thousand guns they would calibrate
He sort a loss, if devil crossed
Moved on 'em swiftly, if worlds away set the shuttle off
Horror in the ville without the Amity
Scars upon the grill of your friend's family
Workers utilized then brutalized
Performance scrutinized then crucified
Wakes, fire bombs, function's shot up
The jakes was not alarmed, but damned is the product


Shooters mans, grizzlies stands up in the GT
Klansman with the sword that'll blow up a van
When the people's come, blow right past
Mind your business, I don't know nothin'
They found his ho in the trash
Barbecue wings, blings for my niggas that's true kings
Sit up in the crib, catch somethin' and screw fiends, yeah
Watchin' me, next time scotch me
I drink Cristal liquor, I'm a version of Hitler
On wax, no 'dacks just water
A du-rag on, I scratch waves sayin' niggas is trash
Yo, learn how to write, beware
I pull up, he here
I should've known I had a clone, see weird niggas'll get irked
Murked, dropped off in a new turf
Trunk full of Siamese rats and gnats yo
I do it for the cats and pits and all the bitches with big tits
Five hundred shoe game switch
Shake that shake, I bake
I live in the state that kill niggas over grits and steak
You might get smacked with a Mac 11
Or run off the road or shot in McDonalds for frontin' with fake niggas


Ay yo, Saladin vivid Wall Street sixteen
Muslims, kufis, uzis, the Wu is supreme
Ferociously I rank general a world's above self
Conspicuous crime make me grab the nine off the shelf
The dark hallways amazingly convenient
The phoenix with Jane, jugglin' cracks or playin' with ninas
Thug law of the streets, gangsters crave the beef to feast
Fiends with plates, a snake wanna eat
Gaze at the spectacular rapper, niggas is Dracula
Rap tours, Priest the hood ambassador
Passion for war, Wu-Massacre, threats, they never worry me
Plots to my death, mic jack conspiracy
Lyrically, I'm only afraid of my own ability
Words that shape into nuclear wars, we shooting through walls
Bringing down the mall, I ring around the store
Planets of the Apes, bandanas on our face
Hammers on our waist, cameras out in space
The nickel plate, fake armor, will harm ya'll snakes




And in our line of work we need all the help we can get
Tony Wings the name. He works for a drug ring in Central America
Who wants to kill him? No information, say yes or no

Fuck a nigga hottie, that ho pussy probably
Burn like the deserts of Mogabi, for real
Ain't nothing fraudulent here, we pioneer
Commandeer a new frontier, this be the Wu yeah
36 Chambers of fear, huh you lost it
Information leaking out your faucets, hmm
Time to forfeit your crown and leave the grounds
There's a new sheriff in town holding it down
It's the two holster, shit shot smoker
Wanted dead or alive, bounty on the poster
Wild in the West, a student of my culture
And life is the test, hold up
Let a nigga catch his breath
I'm still paying dues and the last one is death
Back to the essence with that shit you stressing, this rap profession
Now peep Tical, the son of the Shaolin Isle

Jakes beware of black rap millionaires
Rock Airs, leather goose, bears blowing this year
1-800-GAMBINO niggas, yeah


Wu roll together as one, I call my brother Sun cause he shine like one


Solid gold crown is shining, we're blinding like some diamonds
I'm reclining in the sky on a cloud with silver lining
Double breasted, bullet proof vested, well protected
The heart, the rib cage, the chest and solar plexus
Casting stones, cracking two-hundred and six bones
And watch your ass get blown to a sea of fire and brimstone
How dare you approach it with them poems
The overfiend like noah bean green souls with a soldier mean
The grand exquisite imperial wizard or is it
The Rzarector come to pay your ass a visit
Local bio-chemical, universal giant, the black general
Licking shots at Davy Crockett on the bicentennial
Happy Millennium two thousand
Microchips, two shots of penicillin goes up your Adrenalin
Son it's time for bouting
It's a model you're resembling the niggas who like following
Trapped inside your projects like a genie inside the bottle and


God stepping forth upon holy ground of the track
It's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like I'm under attack
So I decided to bite down on the mic
So the pain of the track won't deny the fact that I'm the master
For what lurks, is an expert that hurts
The individual who tries to visualize under
Cause I strike, like thunder
Niggas couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable
My wisdom fucks up your respiratorial
Systems are fractured by the killer tactics
Style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged
Enter the entity, my vicinity
Is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity
Represent the school of hard knocks and Glocks my
Clan is hostile and got mad moss for blocks so
Feel the force of impact from the iron side of
The gat as I attack the track
From the blind side of the pack, Starks pass the chrome
Watch a nigga get blown out his motherfucking dome-piece
Deceased, laid to rest


Who come to get you, none, they want guns
I be the first to set off shit, last to run
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother Son cause he shine like one


Yo, aiyyo I got this under my wing, move give me room
Holding up your saloon, clean sweep, like a broom
Full moons make me howl like a wolf out of breath
Sold only new vocal cords you heard Genius on Gef
So step back, to the lab at, high velocity
My team make hand-to-hand sales, we're like a pharmacy
Fuck Geraldo, Pablo's plan bro is Bravo
Goodfellas we know, best sellers become novels
The man rocking head bands, silk scarves and jams
Early 80's British Walkers, playboys, mocks and shams
The laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies
Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's
Remember them kids that came off with eight million
Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavilions
Them flour heads must have been stupid
Tell me how the fuck black niggas get caught with all that loot kid
There's jet money, underground money
Submarines and rings too bad you fucked up dummies



Intro:

Wu will grow like llello, ley no, plus coolin in Barbados
Ricaans be givin me much shit, the dutch shit
Stay cool papi, seize it with enough shit
Back at the lab a, crack's bagged up
Yo niggas act up, what blow up the workers if they hafta
Senoritas, fuckin up a storm buyin guards margaritas
Suckin his dick, up in the whip long
Designed for rhyme prime nigga jail time jiggas
Them niggas up in Height figures bitin niggas
Silks Wally-Wear finger rolled chain yeah
Jakes beware black rap millionaires
Rock hairs leather goose bears blowin this year
One eight hundred gambino niggas yeah

Meth:
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother Sun 'cause he shine like one

Verse Three: RZA, a.k.a. Bobby Steels
Solid gold crown is shinin
Solid gold, check it Sun yo
Solid gold crown be shinin and blindin like some diamonds
I be pioneering the style in the cloud with silver linings
Double breasted, bullet proof vested, well protected
The heart the rib cage the chest and solar plexus
Casting stones, cracking two-hundred and six bones
And watch yo' ass get blown to a sea of fire and brimstone
How dare you approach it with dim pones
The overfiend like noah bean green souls with a soldier mean
The grand exquisite imperial wizard oh is it
The Ryzarector come to pay your ass a visit
Local bio-chemical, universal giant, the black general
Lickin shots to Davy Crockett on the bicentennial
Happen millenium two thousand microchips two shots of penicillin
Goes up your adrenalin son it's time for boutin
It's a mileage resemblin niggas who like followin
Trapped inside your projects like a genie inside the bottle

Verse Four: Master Killer
God steppin forth upon holy down of the track
It's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like I'm under attack
So I decided to bite down on the mic
So the pain of the track won't deny the fact
That I'm the Master, for what lurks, is an expert
That hurts the individual who tries to visualize under
'Cause I strike, like thunder
Niggas couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable
My wisdom fucks up your respiratorial
Systems are fractured by the killa tactics
Style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged
Enter the entity, my vicinity
Is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity
Represent the school of hard knocks and Glocks my
Clan is hoss and got mad moss for blocks so
Feel the force of impact from the iron side of
The gat as I attack the track
From the blind side of the pack, Starks pass the chrome
Watch a nigga get blown out his muthafuckin dome
Piece, deceased, laid to rest

Chorus

Verse Five: Ghostface Killer, a.k.a. Tony Starks
Yo, aiyyo I got to serve them my way, move give me room
Holdin up your saloon, clean sweep, like a broom
Full moons make me howl like a wolf outta breath
Sold only new vocal cords I heard Genius on Gef
So step back, to the lab at, high velocity
My teammate, enhance cells well like a pharmacy
Fuck horado pablos plan growas bravo
Goodfellas we know, best sellas become novels
The man rockin head bands, silk scarves and jams
Early 80's british rock, playboys, mocks, and shams
The laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies
Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's
Remember them kids that came off with 8 million
Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavillions
Them flower heads must have been stupid
Tell me how the fuck black niggas get caught wit all that loot kid
That's jet money, undaground money
Submarines and rings too bad you fucked up dummies

Cosa cosa, come on...




He in a wheelchair moving like Xavier
His arms is crossed he had a haunted power moves in Arabia
Glassware chemist cocaine riding with vengeance
Crib elevator 13 benzs, 7 snipers 64 rifles that might pull
He chuckles work is the thick glass I chose
Less road is the Lex luga load
Give him the Globe take his 19 shots and go
Nego Mallanna him and his brother don't fuck with us
Shot up Lacy's crib his ass is all dusted up
Goofy niggas get slapped perfectly
Bring all yo goons I got 2 lurches will merk your best man
Styrofoam nozzles drug boys come with them hallows we wulocks
Warlord models New York the home of the brave
You'll get your face caved in you sell out y'all niggas is slaves


Ayo big city corruption high life train heights
Plane flights war stay more games and gunfights
Bad company city streets and living comfortably
Big dreams live it up till them boys come for me
Big city corruption high life train heights
Plane flights war stay more games and gunfights
Bad company city streets and living comfortably
Big dreams live it up till them boys come for me


Got goons ready to ride ready to die
And not fooling round to kill yo they will comply
Sports fly like the fourth of July
Bullets fly but his fortress is fortified he will survived
He ain't got that through his conflict and combat
Mercenary assassins celebrating contracts
Black water the body count is enormous
Remorseless eliminate all informants
Engage in war kick down the door hit the floor
Warlords like African sworn rebel forces
Sparked revolutions with shootings that they doing
And they moving as a unit through these dark days
Sparks plays in his bloodshed
Blood red sunset the world is left upset
When you shot you not thinking that you have
Mula, new ammunition new shots




Ayo big dreams live em up rogue chains and leather gloves
Rottweilers wilding off the dope fiend and powdered drugs
Ma seargantist got them choppers and chopper rick
To watch his children with choppers and click shots full of hollow tips
Lock the city down crack communist
Black conglomerate moving through this metropolis
Rocking gold  with diamond-crusted iron glyphs
Bring the shooters through call it third world politics
Rootless gorilla warfare in the suites
Standing like a super villain on the roof
With a Luga and a bad German Bitch holding the loot
She a killer with a mask and a ass to match a murderer's pursuit
And I never ever ever have to dust off the metal
Cause ma lessons won't let it settle
Swinging power like a Brewed street over lord
Birth from out the bowels of the ghetto
Screaming loud from a pedal stool a thousand of truth








Raekwon:

Yo yo yo yo
Now we gonna drink some good Night train


Champion gear that I rock, you get your boots knocked
Then attack you like a pit, then lock shit down
As I come and freaks the sound
Hardcore, but givin' you more and more like ding!
Nah, shorty, get you open like six packs
Killa Beez attack, flippin' what, murder one
Phat tracks, aight, I kick it like a Nike Flight
Word life, I get that ass robbed on spite
Check the method from Bedrock 'cause I rock your head to bed
Just like rockin' what? Twin Glocks!
Shake the ground while my beats just break you down
Raw sound, goin' to war right now
So, yo, bombin', We Usually Take All Niggas Garments
Save your breath before I vomit


I be that insane nigga from the psycho ward
I'm on the trigger, plus I got the Wu-Tang sword
So how you figure that you can even fuck with mine?
Hey, yo, RZA! Hit me with that shit one time!
And pull a foul, niggas, save the beef for the cow
I'm milkin' this ho, this is my show, Tical
The fuck you wanna do for this mic piece, duke?
I'm like a sniper, hyper off the ginseng root
PLO Style, buddha monks with the owls
Now who's the fuckin' man? Meth-Tical


On the chessbox
"Wu-Tang style"


I leave the mic in body bags, my rap style has
The force to leave you lost like the tribe of Shabazz
Murderous material made by a madman
It's the mic wrecker, Inspectah, bad man
From the bad lands of the killer
Rap fanatic representin' with the skill that's iller
Dare to compare, get pierced just like your ear
The Shooby Doo-Wop pop, strictly hardware
Armed and geared, 'cause I just broke out the prison
Charged by the system for murderin' the rhythm
Now lo and behold another deadly episode
Bound to catch another fuckin' charge when I explode


Slammin' a hype-ass verse 'til your head burst
I ramshack dead in the track, and that's that
Rap assassin, fast and quick to blast and hardrock
I ran up in spots like Fort Knox
I'm hot, top notch, Ghost thinks with logic
Flashbacks how I attacked your whole project
I'm raw, I'm rugged and raw, I repeat
If I die, my seed'll be ill like me
Approachin' me, yo, out of respect, chops to neck
I get vexed, like crashin' up a phat-ass Lex
So, clear the way! Make way! Yo, open the cage!
Peace, I'm out, jettin' like a runaway slave


You gettin' stripped from your garments, boy, run your jewels
All the meth got me open like fallopian tubes
I bring death to a snake when he least expect
Ain't a damn thing changed, boy, Protect Ya Neck
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah jam is fatal
Quick to stick my Wu-Tang sword right through your navel
Suspenseful force bein' brought through my utensil
The pencil, I bring strong winds up against you
Havoc, then run up through your county like the Maverick
Caps through the tablets, I gots to make the fabrics


A-a-a-ah-ah, are you a warrior killer slicin' shit like a samurai?
The Ol' Dirty Bastard from the bar
Ol' Dirty clan of terrorists
Comin' at your ass like a sorceress, shootin' that piss
Niggas be gettin' on my fuckin' nerves
Rhymes they be kickin'
Make me wanna kick their fuckin' ass to the curb
Boy got funky fresh like the Old Specialist
A carrier, messenger, bury ya
This experience is for the whole experience
Let it be applied, Unique drop that science


M-M-My clan is thick like plaster, bust ya, slash ya
Slit a nigga back like a Dutch Master
Killer, style jumped off in Killa Hilla
I was the thriller in the Ali-Frazier Manila
I came down with phat tracks that combine and interlock
Like gettin' smashed by a cinder block
Pow! Now it's all over; niggas seein' pink hearts
Yellow moons, orange stars, and green clovers




Niggas on the left, brag shit to death
Now hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, c'mon and attract to what
Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, brag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, c'mon and attract to what

Automatic money




From the slums of Shaolin, to the dungeons of the 36 Chambers
{Good, Wu-Tang Martial Expert}
(Straight up and down) we now bring you, Cilvaringz
{Good, Wu-Tang Martial Expert}
Wu-Tang Martial Expert (this is all gutter shit)
Now shadowbox with this real rapper (we in the building, nigga)
{They say he's a swordsman, to me, it seems he can't use a sword}


I wrote the album in sincerity, GZA, you feeling me?
Cuz if they bombing for peace, I'm like fuck her for virginity
See I'm that Killa Bee, I'm back up on it
I'll attack and sting everything that's corporate
Plus the fake, everything stay cornered til I'm done
And ride back straight to my office
In '99, I struck deals with RZA, build with RZA
A natural on top, that can't be shot
So poverty never became my topic
And followed politics and the became obnoxious
So now I'm Chuck, I'm Nas, I'm BP, I'm Slim
I'm Technique wrapped in one CD
Freely inspired by life itself
Trying to speak real issues, it might just help
From the Wu-Tang Clan, Martial Expert
Taking care of vein with the sword, where your neck's hurt
The knowledge verse with that I attack first
It's da-da-da-da-da-da, could it get that worse?


Aiyo, the 36 Chambers of Death
How many ways can we devise to kill a man?
The sword thrust, palm strike
Poison tip knife, go across his head with a metal pipe
You are being injected with a high frequency
Piercing through your brain
(If you should lose it, you're finished)
It's hard to maintain, nigga!


You see them Arabs, they hooked on 50, they go to rehab
They come back yelling, Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Jihad!
They wanna lay back, and bounce in clubs
I said a life's so dark? Take these darts as lightbulbs
Switch it, reality's ugly
And ignorant mentalities bug me, it's rugby
Trying to get your points across, you get fucked up
Trying to get your joints in stores, you get fucked up
Trying to make some noise against war, you get locked up
Try to get your voice to be heard, you get shot up
And those who fear God, will not fear death
And so I went and got, RZA, GZA and Meth
Plus I went and got, Ghost, Killa and Chef
Have 'em speak on fire beats while I co-wrote the rest
So I don't care if you write, I swing it to the left
And I don't care if you dislike my writing exact
I'm that real, slay me now, prototype
That you dislike, recline and Dolomite
Get my shit right...


Good, Wu-Tang Martial Expert
Good, Wu-Tang Martial Expert

His technique was perfect




Don't take it per-son-al.. it's only mu-sic
Holla at me.. yo! Yo!
Ice Water! Yo.. yo


Try me, P.C.'ll put a clip in a nigga
Fuck a hole, my bullets'll dig a ditch in a nigga
Listen, I've been reppin', only pack big weapons
One shot to the stomach, you missin' ya midsection
I'm off the wall, dog, I could off ya balls
Stick his ass to the rooftop, toss 'em off
Hit the Ave with the rooftop off the porch
I get money cuz it costs to floss, nigga you feelin' me?
And if not then fuck what you gotta deal with me
I've only been here for a minute but haters wanna get rid of me
P.C. creep with at least three heats
And a shotgun stashed underneath the backseats


Niggas actin' like you don't feel a draft
You seen ya man? Tell him I'ma kill his ass
And I don't, wanna talk I want a mill in cash
I come through 'tards shittin', lookin' ill in the past
Cuz it's the, Ice Water, don't get it confused
And one false move'll cause me to spit at you dudes
It's Stumic, motherfucker and I'm pickin' ya food
And ain't no one out you know that my niggas'll do you
Let's spit on 'em, rush these niggas
And crush several fuckin', will leave a dent out ya liver
Only kid in the hood with a mustard ninja
Heard you broke down good, well I fucked ya sister


Eh yo we Wyld in Da Club, style in the club
This is for my niggas gettin' down in the club
At the bar throwin' down rounds in the club
Talk slick and get the four pound in ya mug


Yo I keep my gun on me, what the fuck y'all want from me?
Y'all touch my property somebody gon' die, uh-huh
This ain't no joke, it's for real
My niggas they totin' they steel
All it takes a phone call and they ready to ride
Get ready to die


Eh yo the cards are dealt, the words are spoken
Nigga, welcome to the Hell, the gates is open (uh-huh)
Gatekeeper, first degree murder through the speaker
Who deep enough to flow with the reaper?
Stuck in the middle, I spit a little riddle
Leavin' niggas crippled, my niggas ball 'em like Kerry Kittles
You niggas makin' it hard, it's really kinda simple
If a nigga gotta pull it out I'm puttin' it in ya temple


Official I do this, rude maneuver
I use the Rugers to keep the bullets movin' through ya
Weak anatomy, fuck the small talk and flattery
Ya power is weak, to beef you need much more batteries
Keep it genetic, or dead it, Ice Water Inc. we said it
Whoever so-called did it or said it, promote it and spread it
Fake it or front it, get ambushed and confronted
With slugs in ya head, back, chest and stomach
Niggas don't want it or ask for it, so we give it to 'em
Dead in the club and let them things spit and rip through 'em dead in the club
Is you gon' fuck around and be the nigga dead in the club?
(Yeah? Uh-huh..)



Egyptian look, gazelles on, L's lit, this how it's goin' down
Ski mask, Chanel shit, move like a terrorist click
Nineteen eighties babies, worldwide, ya girl on our dick
All you know is Rae look good, he hood
Envision the flips, I make money like them niggas who take money
Fresh out the can, Duran look, Astro van

Yo listen B we got the best clientele since '83
Fuck it, pull out the pot let's cook it

Sat back burning a big dutch
With the crisp 18 shot Glock, stashed in my nuts
Poured it in the Pyrex sizzling

Rainy day murder black won't miss him
Still I'm yelling this shit is business
But they still ain't gon' violate
What I stand for wid these drizzers
He took it off the stove run the water
Trying to work me yo
Knew I shouldn'ta hit the nigga's daughter
He mighta showed more love
Than went in the freezer
Broke the ice down, pour it in
We both looking at it on the twirl around particles grew
Fly Khaluas is mad sliding Coronas through
Feeling like Castro's cousin
Gave them niggas all of my life
All of my paper all my judgement
It droppa only like an ounce worth
Should I just come out my shirt
Go berserk and let the Macks burst
Skate off body in the Bronx
Same shit Gotti was on
Shallah they gonna get your's play it calm
Seventeen five was the total plus the five
Hundred for the cab driver that was rolling




Hey, fuck you, man

Yae yo, yae yo, cop that yae yo

Seventeen five was the total plus the five
Hundred for the cab driver that was rolling
Yo, he blank rubbed his nose like a Nazi
Jocked me, Glock piece cocked
Ready to light up shop, watch me
Standin by the 'fridgerator then caught the gleam
From his eye, and he watch a nigga ride for the rent
He looked up, recognized real
Oh Papi, yo, pardon me
Your glass spilled all over the floor
Guess that's real, we both shakin hands
Holdin guns, gave me back, all my ones
We did that shit political, it's all done
Last word, we bout to vanish
Cognio, you woulda bust, right
Don't Puerto Ricans speak Spanish


Yae yo, cop that yae yo
Yae yo, bap do dap do da da yae yo
Cop that yae yo, yae yo


Say hello to my little friend


Lay back like a fat Buddha, holding my pearl-handle mover in a Land Cruiser
Rims shine like day time in Bermuda
I write rhymes smoother than niggas
Who be fronting like, half a key movers
I have to be financially set, new Lex in front of my duplex
My shine dripping wet, new nines in case your crew flex
My brown eyes leaving your boo stressed
So bad you had to get a new red vest
Cause I collects tax
My advice is to accept that
Step back, blast, don't even wet that
Yo, it's mandatory, I'm self explanatory
Don't front on me shorty
Young Scarface, for real
I wanna die blasting
Fuck stashing
My next fifty G's I'm buying me a fire wagon
Thugged out, leather interior
Meg is superior
My art of war dented your area
My mug shot praised in jail cells and drug spots
My razor, touch faces and carve rocks
Corrupt cop cases
Had me on semi-vacations
It's day dreams, lay down way schemes
For niggas who get payed and takes cream
Drugs supplier, thugs admire
Ghetto dun-dun gunfire
Keep my nine higher
The drama equilizor
I speak the mind-a, Keyser
Sze, no survivors


Say goodnight to the bad guy
Go ahead, I take your fucking bullets

Hear me roar, Timbaland tree, weed galore

Oh, that's Meth Man, southpaw, I throw my left hand
To that hardcore shit that even make the Tec jam
Oh my goodness! Trust me, ain't nuttin' like some hood shit
Gotta love my dogs but ain't nuttin' like a good bitch
Strictly, if I'm goin' down, she comin' wit me
Whole time screamin', "Oh my God!", ain't no mystery


Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, you either step or get stepped upon
Correct me if I'm wrong but fake thugs never last long
Can't wait until ya fake ass gone
Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, you either step or get stepped upon
Nigga, uh-oh! I think they're playin' our song
Lit blunts, Clan in the front, sayin' "It's on!"


Try to Wu hate, duck, you could suck my
Watch the block get clear when I buck my
Boomerang darts, you can't duck my
No tellin' which Clan man you got struck by
Chains get tucked when he walk by, hawk eye
Arrows bein' fired from crossbow, I talk fly
You can't Etcha-sketch all my rhyme threat
Try to bite my flow, you catch ya throat strep
Soaked in cess, dope, you eat the cold Tec's
Bold flex, W crown, the ice O-X
Up in the oolie, yo, who you know?
John Bizzi, Ghost Deini, Rollie Finger and them toolies yo
Stainless Bobby, boy, you have an English folly
To try to detain the slang that we can to polly
Plus you didn't peep Irief, kid, you sleep
I seen this heap of shit, you in steep




Yo, amist the gravel, play the words of the Big Apple
Broadcastin' live from the pits of the battle
Wigs split and rattled, get shook out ya saddle
You ever hear me losin', one of y'all fix the panel
Ask who? Wu, that's true, known piranhas
Who knows drama, fathers of your whole persona
The mad doctor, stay locked in the O-R
In too deep, beyond reach of the sonar
Still a vet, say my name next to hall of fame
Hurtin' third string players, first day in the game
It's on, son, the Killa Bee swarm come
Make the world shake with one continuous drum




Wave ya gun, Killa (I got you)
Shoot this nigga in his face fast, mumblin' (I heard y'all forgot Wu)
Wear ya crown, black down (Watch the block too)
Blow at y'all niggas (Blowin' at the cops too)
Eh-yo, my wallets stay bulletproofs, racin' in Coups, yea we the realest
Ultraviolet leathers on, pealin' this, love lookin' the illest
Gorilla things, monster background with a history
You're pumpin' crack, yap clowns, we all real in here
Strap a bomb on a family member, let y'all niggas know we here
Blasted, it's like cheeba when I splashed it
Real reefer heads'll know the meanin' of hittin' glass
I told y'alls, against y'all, Ginsengs, avenge Gods
Picture me stabbin' you in the yard for R's
Kid saw Staten, nine Bin Ladens
Valors on, colorful draws, lookin' all relaxed in


Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, You either step or get stepped upon
Correct me if I'm wrong but fake thugs never last long
Can't wait until ya fake ass gone
Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, You either step or get stepped upon
Nigga, uh-oh! I think they're playin' our song
Lit blunts, Clan in the front, sayin' "It's on!"




Yo, I'm gonna roll some trees up and think about life
Grab a wife, make her queen, throw a baby in her spleen, get right
Write a cheque, be a team, stay one, who give a fuck when they come
Blow her right, pay out and get aight
Cheque writers this goes for you, check the vet writers
All 40'ing up, we respect biters
Drinking on dead cash and coins and goons of rap
That's when I come through with fly heads and Nikes on a track
I'm a track nigga attacking a track, strictly rap nigga
Piece of the A, my South niggas track niggas, dead niggas
All the above, we love 
Y'all niggas stay paid and ask me for shit
We just a far little caked up, baked up, a thumb up
Plunge ya, pluck ya lady up, backshop, we run jump blunts up
Doing our thing, I'm  down
With a couple round on me, homie feel my style out





Live! In stereo


Yessir! This what I wanna hear my nigga, yeah
Yeah yeah
You don't even know that's the official word up in the town
You heard? Ha ha ha
Get that swing, yessir! Get it in man
That's the official shit kid, mmhmm
Word up, we gon' take it back to the big park 'n shit
Yeah, when niggas was rhymin hard and comin crazy
Electrifying and vivid, yo


I'm like a rabbi, fresh new mag and I'm mad high
Stolen black Jag I brag fly, yeah
Yo a project thug, political gangster, starving Langston Hughes
The Jews want the crib when the God dies
I'm deadly, metaphors'll dog you while I'm in the Forbes
First 500 niggas who raw live
Yo B, the nigga Shallah, he low-key
But he O.G., half of his niggas gone or in hidin
Federallis'll sneak, police, holdin my old piece
Heard the young policeman died
58 carats of glass, the Aston
Blueberry black where I keep my ices and knives at
One of the force rawest, yo we're British aware
Who get money shoot dice in his fortress
Mocknecks and stragglers, eightball jackets the hagglers
Of the rap game, post up surprise
I want that spot, coolin with the Supervillain team
All you other playboys is twats
Niggas be down for the murder game
Run in the church, grab the rifle, put one in a nigga frame
I'm thirsty, hungry like a Somalian
Polly with them niggas with the waves in they dome like tsunami
All we do is get fresh and fuck ma
Probably yo' baby ma gave me head in Barney's while I calmly
And I got giants in armies
While we rock mean colored clothes and don divas
Yeah Chef back, some call him Louis Smith
Slash Lex Diamond and his chick sell crack
We rep bananas, beat this, legend of Stan Smith
700 dollar jeans, keepin your man distance
Yeah son, gimme your ear son

Yo yo yo, yo yo get the fuck away from the ropes man


{*beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep*}
Doom, the warning signal again
Somebody approaches!

What manner of creatures are these?
There they are again, FIRE!

"A gunshot from inside the house, forces a change of plans"
{*monster roaring*}
"A straightforward entry, has turned into what appears to be"
"A barricaded standoff"

"POLICE DEPARTMENT! COME TO THE FRONT DOOR!"
"Anything you say, cracker"

As the funky beat continues..



(Intro w/ Raekwon ad-libs)


No more rocks, Rubber Glocks homie
Move here all I hear, Call the cops on me
Ankle gold straight for my chucks, Chevy truck
Good CD, I rhyme to every nigga wit ill weed
We at the cheeba house toast'n, Rhymes we roast'n a hundred K
All they say is Rae and Ghost shitted
Mind frame puzzled, Bezzle cost one million franks
The Louie luggage bordered in Brussels
No he didn't, Harry Winston watch, My time's limit
I.C.S., The G kitted, We fitted
Making my way all through the garden
Large nigga respect, Yep, The Chef up, He kept calling
Counter move'n with my shorty, We both lizard down
Her neck, My ring blizzard down, Get up in the South
Cooling with the hood goonies
The Mickey Rooney's of the Project when mad logic step in the room


(Yes sir)
Where niggas rock mink coats and carry a mink tote
We got our bitches on mean boats
(Yes Sir)
The money that come we spending it, Getting it
Don't give a fuck you get shot in the rented kid
(Yes Sir)
Don't play with the Kings with blings on
(Yes Sir)
No fake shit, Say the wrong thing and your team's gone
(Yes Sir)
From killers and rap niggas who clap niggas up
What, Yeah but, Go get your little gats nigga


Yo this ain't your average type boss shit
Steel pipes big enough to blow out your fausete
We car buying, Bar buying, Not to mention
My wall got flicks of me standing in the back of a large lion
Shearling on, Shirt chill burning my man up
Style is back up in this like P. and E. Sermon
So what yall wanna do these bars is French toast
Sin City style I'm like Marv in the trench coat
Busting off arrows like Cupid
The truth is I got the mother load from my girl and booked it
Went to my cell shitted out then pooped it
Sat broken down twenty dollars for two sticks
Uhh, I'm a hustler, Yall my customers
Broke niggas just wanna smoke like a muffler homie
It's Crooked I and the Chef, And of course me
Michael Phelps of this shit who wanna endorse me




If it's war I'm reaching for the heat
I got bullets the size prehistoric teeth
That'll bite you like the heater or the beef
So I feed it more to eat, To lead a boy your sleep
Leave em leaking on the street
Then I'm creeping low, Discreet
I'm the reason for police when I'm squeezing on my piece
Like I be squeezing on your piece
When she drinking on my skeet
She move when a gangsta say so
She wanna pop skittles, Wanna taste the rainbow
You never know, Crooked could be poke'n your Mom
In ______ while smoke'n a bong, The ultimate Don
Closed mouth don't get feed, I'm quoting you Psalms
Closed fists don't get bread, So open your palms
Yeah, How can you not feel that
I'm on Rodeo with the top peeled back yelling C.O.B
I took a vow of abstinence for ya sucker emcees
Which mean I swear to God none of yall fucking with me, Uhh

(Outro w/ Raekwon ad-libs)




Ay yo I'm skinned up, Nike's is scuffed
Still buggin' earlier around four how I escaped the bust
The way I fell cracked the face of my watch
My mans chantin' me on like "Run son! Don't go up in the spot"
Jettin' through bushes and backyards, neighbors is rattin' me out
Dogs is barkin' all you hear is the car's sirens
I'm tryin' to think and toss the iron
Bomb in my sweats got me runnin' funny, you think I'm lyin'
May God strike me if he don't like me, I'm tired and I'm out of breath
The weed got me paranoid, my heart's poundin' through my chest
Tryin' to focus up and make progress
That's what I get for slingin' in them projects
Next thing you know I'm in this bitch's crib chillin'
Told her my story and like this I had her legs in the ceiling
Cookin' me fries, fish sticks, hot side of them biscuits
While she doin' this, the bitch still slidin' on lipstick
Now I got the fat stomach on, she crackin' a dutch
I'm playin' with her pussy on the couch, I'm ready to fuck
Like come here miss lady wop, where you put the condom box?
She finished off the last one, oh shit I hear the cops
Handcuffs and talkies, I mashed her white Yorkie
Jettin' up the stairs, them pigs want revenge like Porky's
So I slid, hid behind the wall, opened the door
Like ooo I seen my man Meth goin' in raw
So he jumped up balls out, hid in the closet
I'm dyin' laughin', he said "Yo Starks be quiet!"


...and let me put my drawers on, nigga what kinda dope you on?
Should've knocked before you came in the spot, Ghost you wrong
Bustin' in here on that government shit
Got this chick screamin' grabbin the sheets tryin' to cover her tits
She's asthmatic and you laughin' son
I bump my toe on the nightstand just runnin' tryin' to grab the gun
Shit's real man, you spazzin' dun
There comes a time in a man's life, he gotta toss his pack and run
You know we family like Crack and Pun
But Mr. GFK, state your business after that be one
Now can it be that you hot lord?
You did some shit on the block that the cops tryin to lock you for?
Can't believe you blowin' the spot lord
My chick is buggin', she trippin'
My dick keep slippin' out my boxer drawers
Now I'm caught up in the drug sting
Niggas is callin' my horn, police is hittin' every corner we on
Can't understand it, it's a thug thing
And in the moment of thought, I'm interrupted by Shallah Raekwon


I need my money Meth, gonna buy them hundred birds
Tell Tone get at me, all them little clients want work
He know we fresh out, tell the kid meet me, matter of fact beep me
Word to mother lord, son he got me hurt
You still fuckin' shorty? I knew it
The big mouth broad that be yolkin' my balls out
Her little brother wanted two bricks
You know the nigga licks, a Maybach on twenty-six
All he do is get money, hustle, he's a dick
He told me foul shit, wild shit
That nigga wear a lot of loud shit, no that Steve Rifkind style shit
Hit me with some other talk, him in New York
They robbed the Venezuelan niggas, stabbed his son with a fork
That was Jesus' rooster's little niece, little nooses
Father's homeboy, that's the kid who gave us a boost
He gave them things on the arm, said for us to be calm
And if some beef pop off, go ahead and ring the alarm




Read the fish, get the red lobster, tilt your glass, seen shorty ass
That's what's happenin', son, pass the hot sauce
Straight vibes, corner to corner, me and my mans glanced at her
The look, sure do prove she a woman
Yo, good morning, mamma, what you ordering, right now, some water
And it hit me, mami was a dime and a quarter
Thirty five cent, thirty five dollars or thirty five bricks
That's live, then I seen her eye and blew a kiss

Baby, baby, baby, from the day I saw you
I really, really wanted to catch your eye
There's something special 'bout you
I must really like you
Cause not alotta guys are worth my time
Oooh baby, baby, baby, it's gettin kinna crazy
Cause you are takin' over my mind


And it feels like, OooOooooOOo...

It feels like, OooOooooOOo...
You don't know my name
Round and round and round we go
Will you ever know?


Oh! Baby, baby, baby
I see us on our first date
You doin everything that makes me smile
And when we had our first kiss
It happened on a Thursday
Ooh, it set my soul on fire
Oh, baby, baby, baby

My imaginations runnin' wild


And it feels like, OooOooooOOo...

Round and round and round we go

Got me feelin' all crazy inside
I'm feelin' like... OH!


Yo, yo, I met you in the restaraunt, see you every wednesday
Fly little waiter, so we exchanged data
It took a while, I ain't even think you would call
You used to walk by, you once said nothing at all
I ordered a special, know that every time that I do
I ordered the chocolate, a soda, just reminds me of you
So you holla out of the blue (damn), gotta catch a flight
When I touchdown, shorty, I'mma holla at you


I'm doin nothn I've ever done, for anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of you, cause did I mention? (OH!)
You about to miss a good thing
And you'll never know how good it feels to have
All of my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience
My lovin (OH!)
Cause my lovin' feels like...

You don't know my name
Round and round and round we go (and I swear)

Will you ever know it?


Well I'mma have to just gon head and call this boy
Hello? Can I speak to... to Michael? Oh, hey how you doin'

From the coffee house on 39th and Lenox
You know the, one with the braids?
Yeah... well I see you on Wednesdays all the time
You come in every Wednesday on your lunch break, I think
And you always order the special, with the hot chocolate
Look man, I mean, I know girls don't usually do this
But I was wonderin' if maybe we could get together
Outside the restaurant one day?
You know cause I do look...
A little different outside my work clothes
Wait, hold up my... my cell phone
Breakin up, hold up
Can you hear me now?
Yeah so what day did you say?
Oh yeah... Thursday's perfect man

Baby, be mine, bitch.. hahah




Yup
Get this flow together nigga
Get that flow sounding ridiculous you heard
You heard
For real
Check the flow


Glass shoe tape
Wristband kick slaying cub cop a pair
Mind blown bricks laying whats foreign
Grew up on stick ups
The whole click robbed know we ain't starving yes
Pulling out big notes yes
Jumping in the big S I'm fresh
All about success let's flex
From the rip get checks what's next
Hit grass get a pass that stress
I remain non-lame I'm blessed
Pull the nine I'm firing yes
Cause my mind knows best
Catch me in the shop
Buying a bitch out
Flying in a Lear
I'm right in the bitch mouth
Heard I'm in the chair
Louie the bitch out
Its all real yeah
You heard it from his mouth


You hear me
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me

Crown broken down, freaks want a thousand
Let me stroke 'em down
One bite, one town
Send siblings, hustling is business
Tustling niggas up, stomp 'em in Tims
Meet my hounds
Sitting on plainsclothes
Bitch calm down
All I rock's Kangols
Six all brown
Inside mangos
Getting it hold the town niggas got a rainbow
Everyday motto, seek for pay day
All in the lotto, Sheep's could sued grey
Out in the Cabos eating steak plates
Whatever it do, Keep the same traits
Jeeps with name plates, Sweep the main gates
Try the blunts yo they fixed with green flakes
Living up top, let's rock with team faith
And get money nigga pop I need space


You hear me
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me




Sometimes it feels like
The world spin opposite of the way you spin
Sometimes you just gotta create your own
A world


I been on a mission, man
I been on a mission lately
Some sticky situations I just grinder down to make it
Ive never been to prison, man
Still dont know what it is to break free, no, no
Now I live my vision plan, no need to hallucinate
The nigga be slipping, man, I think they gon make me angry
If they wouldve listened I coulda kept my cool today
Evil got me tripping, man, I dont think that you can say, no, no
Youre in my position, man, you just couldnt hit the brakes


I cant believe it
Word on the streets one of my soldiers talking to them alphabet boys
My first reaction is to find out who, where and why
Put the word out and bring em to me now, but keep him alive
Put some bread on his head and make sure he arrive
Cause this is something I aint tolerating
Plus Im getting impatient
Im fiending to break him, for real, boy, Im salivating
My phone rung its at the seven oclock sharp
They said they had em in one o my warehouses by the dock
Jumped in the Benz with a ill look, no grin
With a still hook, Ima bout to do this coward in
When I got there DD was already tied up
Pillow case on his head and the blood stains dried up
The moment I been waiting for is finally here
I get to see who done betrayed me
Snatched the pillow case off his wig
 him here, now it's time ta face me
Who I seen? My little niece boyfriend, 
He begging me not to kill him, I told him I gotta him
As I poured the gasoline, I thought about my little niece
I know she love him, but he a snail, he tried to put Shallah in jail
Take me from my wife and kids
Why should I spare this maggot life to live
Man, it is what it is, he chose to play this game
I lit the match and watched his frame go up in flames


Get emotion
We in motion
Make commotion
I can feel
How we roll on
Keep it going
Let it go out
Take the wheel
Saw up in your eyes
I'm amazed, I know
Saw up in your eyes
To the things I know
We rode it for life
Put the game on me
If we don't get it right
Put the blame on me


Guess again
Thought that you could pull the wool over a veteran
I would pull the trigger but I'm thinking that it's better I, better I
Burn you like a cinder, let me share the light, share the light
(Yeah)
Gasoline
Pour it in my tank
Now it's absorbing in your skin
Man, this fool is dimmer and I wish she had a better mind, better mind
Where you talking now you were regretting mind, get it right
I been cutting loose ends
Why your lips so loose talking
I could fuck with new friends too
Gotta get it with my new
I could be a nuisance
But not if you use caution
I could be a nuisance
Its time we write some new commandments




Yo, at night time, reflection from the mural
Federal bureau with ikes, did it all our lives
We Swiss bankers, cream making in Australia
Floss whales, we live, men, plus the son of the Mahalias
Gold plated horse with the wooden face, catch me up grace
Iceberg blanket, Queen Cheeba sheets
The Giganti's, paparazzi nazi, elbow money
Invisible glaciers, laying over rastas
Let the stars know, the crescent is the blessing
We came here to show and prove, make moves, for every dollar in the groove
Rhymes that's imported, wore platinum kitchens and shit
Niggas gave bitches, most got extorted


Yo, aqua swiss iceberg wrist, the chocolate swiss miss
Love the Spanish kid, with the Starburst twist
Marvelous, with the '59, 50 fitteds, matching the kicks
That's crispier than Saint Nicolas fish
Do take, niggas slipping the disk, Wop and Rae world premiere shit
Like Sermon and Smith, homey, my sermom is swift
I got them powerful verse, that if
This was a church, the'll give a cripple person a lift
And now he crip walking, I ain't just talking
I do this thing often, ask Kenyon Martin
Last week, I gave his chain a bone
And told him, take this with you to Boston (the kid's awesome)


From every borough to borough, every castle to castle
We connect, put it down, and we ask you
Real niggas rapidly past you, mumbling, come on
Standing right in front of the building, son, nigga, you might die


Yo, I came across the Verrazano, to polly with Mr. Polly, himself
Plus I need a pair of wally's with the cheddar melt
Goat snake skin to coincide with the belt
It's doe or die, baby, like Sosa, hold your penny up high


Aiyo, inkless colorless Aston, toast, nigga, post
One of the finest made taylors to sow
My medicine's growth, young popes, greatest of all time
Spoke, who drove off, had sixty horses on post
It's automatic magic, thirty kangols
Understand, fabric spray at faggots, close
The legacy's dying, fakers approach, hit him with the hater soap
Clap at your gators and snatch your hoe


It's the 2 double 0 3, version of the Cold Crush
And Force MC's, I'm bout to force mc's
To get their weight up, yo Rae, I'm a DJ, and I'm still telling
Rap cats, to step they game up, ain't that some shit, playa?


Hahaha, yeah bulletproof armor tank shit, nigga
P-9 material only, real niggas, Sing Sing style
Word up






Call 'em a lobbyist, he stay parked, this is obvious
He won't leave the block, his people gon' copy this
18 wildin', no cream that's sloppy shit
Need a real nigga to tell him that's jalopy shit
Wrong moves, yeah that old ass Monopoly shit
You need to play chess and kill all that cocky shit
You not hard, you just on some fake Rocky shit
One day nigga gon' smack out your choppers, kid
Yeah we all know that lockin' ain't watchman shit
Skinny jeans, long Timbs, ain't poppin' shit
Just real yeah, general with stocks and shit
Stocky, no Glock, just hand full of rocks and shit
They hold L's and get craned, that's popular shit
Gold ghost on some Phantom of the Opera shit
Take a ill toast and shop, buy more Glocks and shit
Stay away from petty ass slimes who watch your shit

 x2
Young boy penalties, when will you learn
Young boy penalties, when will you learn
Catch young boy penalties, when will you learn


Ay yo, no morals at all, you lost shorty
Don't know which way to get on, come on shorty
You should've stayed around on the real, get lost shorty
Now they sendin' your ass upstate for 40
You wouldn't listen, now you just runnin' in Jordies
Frontin' in the back of the building passin' 40's
You ain't just built for war, you for the ball leagues
But you'd rather front with them four niggas that's corny
Never get money, they sit yappin' they jaw-pieces
That's when they get broke, cracked in 44 pieces
Meet you by the store for the one vision of glory
Then I'mma tear your face off, it's mandatory
I ball forever, through any category yo
It's like a fresh Gucci mock against a Maury
Catch me in a pool full of sharks, I wrestle surely
The realest, fresh off the block with the porgies

 x2


Word, gotta school y'all little branch face ass niggas, man
Stop fuckin' actin' like you're listenin' to the wrong niggas, man
And keep them 71 characters out of your body too, man
Niggas is just fuckin' up the whole poster right now, man




Yo *echoes*

Or get stung by the killer bee stinga from the slums
KnowhatI'msayin son?
Yo son
Of the young Shaolin Monks, chickenheads will get done
You the first man, you go first son


I mobb deep, in cherry Cherokees I forever be
On some thug shit, runnin wild through New York City
Bustin guns rockin jew-els that shine like sun
Stapleton is where I'm from
And been down for years stayed on point like stairs (yeah, word up)
Cause the jealous motherfuckers want to end my career
I never feared, the ghetto is hell, but I learned ta
Keep my mouth shut and pack a nickel-plated burner
And squeeze, if I get front on my nine millimi
Will have my enemies, behind trees
Niggas that think they live cause they puff a little lye
Pack a bullshit, twenty-five, nah don't think they'll kill us


Older cats mack, roll with young godz that got the guns
You right about that kid
Out of town Big Willie niggas best to run
Now yo y'all just keep everything moving you know
Or get stung by the killer bee sting from the slums
The beat is sounding like Star Trek
Of the young Shaolin Monks, taking heads, with the tongue
So yo, youknowhatI'msayin Son?


Yo, deep in the ocean of the Atlantic, here comes the killa falcon
I meditate then swing with the force of mountains
Brain cells is able to be bi-debatable
When I think it's hazardous to your ozone layer
A pre-meditated killer plan so kill the Mayor, my silencer
Causes niggas to hush, then I rush, like Manchus
Who guard jewels and collect, Cash Rules with heavy jewels
I live by name and cut veins
Burning bodies into flames
Between my anger, I lock down every chamber
Hillside strangeler, a nigga with a mask like Lone Ranger
Rap poetic is injected into the brain athletic
Build off of rhymin calisthetics
I'm determined, I raise a army like Hitler young Germans
And become the Allied commander, my enemies is catching on camera
They seek death, I begin to torture them (calm down kid take your time)
By giving butterfly stitches, bear witness
As I hang with Jehovah's Witnesses


Older cats max with young godz that got the guns
Out of town Big Willie niggas best to run
Or get stung, by the killa bee stinga from the slums
From the young Shaolin Monks, taking heads with the tongue


Yo, yo, this is manslaughter, so what you wanna do
Last year, you ran for the border with your crew
I flip, stacks, all the, time when I rhyme
Libra is my sign, and can't stand swine
When I dine, the automatic weapon
Got niggas steppin, in the opposite direction
My jurisdiction, is off grounds to you clowns
My proposition, meaning you go round for round
Straight up and down, I broke the sound barrier
Scarier, than a tight skirt wrapped around a transvestite
The grammar, hype, nigga check your stacks
Or you'll be rhyming with a broke back
Niggas talk about they rollin deep up in here
The only way you roll is if you in a wheelchair


Older...
Yo, y'all calm down man calm down calm down
Yeah, and yo
Now yo, youknowhatI'msayin?
I wanna tell y'all
Y'all up under the restrictions of the Wu camp
Aiyyo Rae, you got Killa Sin
YouknowhatI'msayin?
Madman, Shyheim the Rugged Child
So just take your time and handle life as it comes
Motherfuckin Rubbabandz, the young godz comin through
Cause the real nigga gonna know what they gotta do
Showin and provin youknowhatI'msayin? Shaolin forever


Yo, may all the bullshit cease, increase the war fuck the peace
Make shit hot like rockin tube socks at Jones Beach
In the summer, number one gunner run for cover
Keep em steppin with more Lethal Weapons than Danny Glover
I cock back, action packed raps and gats
Niggas trade mats for prats people react, to RZA sharp tracks
Another day nother body dropped you better keep your shottie cocked
For actin snotty Hobbes catch karate chops
Cuz Wu-Tang live, forever and a day
You better pray for better ways to get away when my Beretta spray
We never play with commercialism
The hardcore rhythm give em more hell than an exorcism
My terrordome be a clever poem let it be known
I'm packin chrome and rollin phatter than eleven bones
My crew's sicker than that AIDS shit
While others get played quick, cause we be making hits through the grave sift
My right hand man, myself and the Clan
Gun and mic stands reverses help me see my first a hundred grand
And to my Physical one love power crazy real
For all them carbon copy niggas lurkin in the rap deal

Yo word up, yo Ghost come here
Ooh, you in trouble
Yo Ghost man, you haven't found out
(What, what happened?)
I know she is frontin' (for real son)
Nah, nah man come on
She is on the block son (damn)


She said you couldn't deny it
Why did you try to hide it?
You buggin, it's just like you
Tell me what am I suppose to do?
Should have told me long time ago
Baby I would not have walked out the door
You tried to deny your own flesh and blood


I couldn't believe my ears when she told me
You had a child and she was the girl
I thought I meant more to you
Shared thoughts with you, held hands with you
You loved only you, not me and not your child
Tell me why, is not worth your while




So many things you need to do
Like take care of your responsibilities
Stand tall and be a man, strong and understand
That the truth will set you free
No need for you to lie, to hurt on me
She said it and I believe it




What can I do, said it - I won't play with you
*singing various lines over each other*
You tried to deny your own flesh and blood


It was the one night stand and the chick tracked me off
I was drunk and the stink-witch slit the condom off
We got seven years in, now boo now picture me
This Hollywood big-head bitch don't mean shit to me
Your eyes look sad and you are hurt boo, pardon
Self, put the drink down, Scotch is bad for your health
Why you slapped me in my sleep, with steamin
Hot grits in the bowl, fiendin to throw it at me
Chill! (Don't try to deny your own flesh and blood)






Yeah, yeah, let's go, nigga


This is your world and my world, nigga, let's make a movie
Get it jumping, hit the box office hard, get it pumping
This is your world and my world, nigga, hundreds to hundreds
Let's burn, then fuck it, put our mamas up, keep 'em fronting
This is your world and my world, nigga, bust a nut
Get a cut, then gettin' paper, by laying in the cut
This is your world and my world, nigga, we flyin' fly
In the bank, nigga, you know how we get down, thanks, nigga


Arm & Hammer boxes, we love foxes, leaning in the Tropics
Blood money, boats is abnoxious
Standing in the mess hall when, nose froze
Posing like a king, I'm rocking New Balances, new silencers
Glass table'll choke, twenty four challengers
Half of my niggas is slow, but they dough island
You know the pantries is full, ranches with bulls
And wolves there, who sit around, fronting in Wu-Wear
I slam a Noodles hat, pull hair, two tokes and Ghost
In a ghost, I be back in the wrong year
Long sleeve, one cuff up, rugged gold teeth
Fronting with Colombian niggas who gave me raw meat
Due to the gangstas that died, forever ride
To the rats in the manholes, who hate, niggas live
But it's all good, you from a poor hood, I guess
Back in the Guess with the Champion hood, what?




Glass sculptures on my vultures, fifty cultures
Play the couch, posted, count your money, hide your toast in
Black tea, sucker free, ask me, clappers is free
Metal knick knacks, get slapped in your hat, B
I'm dynamic rec room potent, that'll blow you in the open
Pay a cop off, fly you your coke in
My house is worth 2.9, my Benz is worth, he want mine
Nowheres, we call that shit high heels
Dedicated heat rock sprayer, spray your mother and your lover
Better pay up, these guns is from Grenada
Wild fight, customized dice, get nice in the Trump Tower
Drunk bitch, spaghetti and sliced
Everybody features is that mean, never leave the lab
Lacking, always in the red, blacks and green
Drug slingers turn into slug singers, one of them snitch?
It's just a gut lingers, laying in the mud


Slimeball ass, niggas, man, for real, man
Stay away, man, knowhatimsayiing?
Get that muthafucking, hater gator spray next to a nigga
We ready to zap one of ya'll niggas, with the quickness
Aiyo, Hav', man, these niggas don't know what it is, man, about hip hop, man
These niggas, man, for real, man, eat them niggas


I got to admit that Shaolin boxing ain't that bad!
But, now watch mine!


Ya'll niggas food, I peep that shit a long time ago
Dick rider niggas trying to front like they grimey, tho
This is my world, I just let you live in it
But the lease is up, you faggot niggas get evicted
How many times I gotta tell you cowards, mind your business
Oh, you still yapping? Time to catch 'em slipping
Doing dirty, we don't mind getting our hands dirty
And you can't fuck with any bitch because her ass dirty
Cuz when it pop off, we just up in shorty ears
And you just stuck with it, and how us niggas got you there
That little bad caramel with the long hair
Got you lined up, and caught in the crosshair
Nothing but bosses here, we enforced the fear
Always in the hood, my office there
Blow a bag with my comrades, polly my next move
And have you niggas bugging, how I wet 'em and crept through







Yea yea, What up my nigga, thats nineteen hundred dollars
I need to see you alright
Yea, lets do that, for real



Buyin' Le Perle, Jimmy Choo, Louis Vuittons, coup ya Benz up
Keep it one thousand trooper  hold ya ends
Me God, despicable me, just a typical G
See everythings a goal, shop, cop, and flee
Up in Finland, thats class gremlins with millions
Thats why I stay luxuried up
Waves and Timberlands, best lover girlfriend
Me romantic thats the antic
Who fuck up in helicopters now land it
Wardrobe remarkable, pen game arsenal
Up in , they got showers here, park it boo
You been a rider rollin, hair up in rollers'
Yo thats my shoulder, you can keep it, I'll mold ya
Black sand beaches, Norwegian I'm treatin'
Four Seasons or The Ritz peep the keys
See the waiters, they suckin' us
Shake that ass, thats a  teaser
Stay bowlegged thats a pleaser



I remember the way, you used to love me
I remember the days, you used to love me


You don't appreciate the time
I put into this love affair of ours baby
I couldn't let you walk around
Thinking it's alright to let me down




I gave you all my precious love
And anything you wanted from me
You didn't hear me calling out
Calling for your warm affection after all this time
You can't deny what I'm feeling is real
And I stood around, stood by your side
Went through all the hurt and pain
And you turned and walked away



Can't give up on the way you used to give it to me
Give it to me
What a feeling it's for real



You didn't hear me calling out
And that's not what love's about
I remember you used to love me
You used to love me every day
Now your love has gone away
I remember I remember
