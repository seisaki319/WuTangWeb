Ah yo yo
My, lyric is AWOL
Batter up play ball
Fuck yall Analog
Niggas we be digital, subliminal command
From the 5 star general
Attack you from the blind side, invisible
To the naked eye
Where them criminals
Better have your 8 essential vitamins and minerals
When wu is coming through you know the outcome
Critical
Conditionin your physical for injurin
The officer and gentleman who stack private benjamin


Off a beat like this
I keep a night stick
In case any stick up kid with heat might miss
I chicken fry rice bitch
In a white trench
Bustin off two macks I'm like "I'm hit"!!!
I'm just playin, I clear the crowd out
Like a peppa spray can sprayin
I throw lightin out the arms raiden
Your guard should pray
Next year I do nothin more than Y2K

And if you say fuck me 
I'm a say fuck you 


From deputant down to stripper
I'm too nonchalant
A drink mixed with four kinds of liquors
Catch me at the bar "Fu Bar"
Ladies know who we are and
Dream of fuckin a star
Who da scrub
Shotgun in this man car
Burnin up
Forever gettin thrown out the club
It be us Paul
Shot out and bugged
I smoke bud, sniff a bee's ass to get a buzz
I'm everything you think you don't know


I throw a 5 in the power
Poppa wheely with the front end hittin speed bumps, 40 miles per hour
I'm out at Howard, next to Baltimore
Takin change out the fountains at shoppin malls
Rats can only afford Chuck E Cheese
The blood in my genes is tough like Buddy Lee
Semi-dart auto off ya, blood coughin
Meth pull the last spark plug with a heart pump



Call me will, enemy at state
When Funk Doc run the scam
New jacks studderin, dudder? man from the upperhand
Punch, atomic bomb'll hit many
From Bricks to South Park you dyin with Kenny
While you bailin I'm trailin
Rockin hard hat helmets clip the satellite surveillance
When I walk by you better not be kickin
Or I put two more in that teriyaki chicken


You've just been fitted for them cement shoes
This is bottom of the lake raps
Stab you in the back
Kung Fu
52 cops can't withstand the 52 blocks
Unless they bust like 52 shots
I'm the has been that have not
Battle kids at Maxwell's house
Know when I'm good to the last drop
Whats my name Meth his name Doc
Just like urban
See me in the gran transportation splurgin
Drivin with a turban who push a black suburban (come on)
We rollin windows half down through the urban
Network law lay it down like a persian
M to the E to the F, spell curtain


Get out your car sucker
This ain't yours
Robbed you with a gun that filled with paint balls
And broads got the nerve to act funny
You a champagne ho, with Kool-Aid money
Frown bitch, Doc up in that town quick
You back down a point on NFL blitz
Im liable to break fool and take two
And put your hole in the earth to escape through

16th Chamber, temple number five


Somebody said it's on, if it is then I'll be set
To blow a nigga up, with my Five Fingers of Death
I bring it to his whole damn fam, understand
If he frontin, on any man down with the Clan
I be comin, for that headpiece you can't cope
For my brother, I even kill a Pope, word to mother
Serial, killa, style from the Isle of Stat
My peoples are you with me where you at?
Shit's gettin deep in here, I mean like thick
Niggas lookin all in my face like they want dick
It's about to hit the fan, hit the flo'
That's all I can stands, and I can't stands no mo'
What is it? Niggas think they bigga
Because they got the finga on the trigga of a biscuit
They don't know I'm wicked, when I start to kick it
With the raw sound, wash it down with a Mystic
Better yet a Snapple, nigga want the juice
But he don't want the hassle
Thought they trying to overthrow the castle
Better yet the temple, I'm comin to your town
Black down, the rental, car, the pistol
YAH! If you don't want a burn from Glock
Then beware, I buck shots, meaning what, the buck stops
Here, no more dough will be made
Unless it's being made by who... the 1-6-Ooh

 + (Method Man)
Chamber four (1-6-Ooh) Chamber four
Temple number nine, temple number nine


I'm the original G-O-D
Making young ladies scream is my specialty
When I go ooh-wah, ooh-wah, ooh-wah, girls wanna get hype
From the funky fresh music that was stereotyped
When I kill, that ol' mad rugged flow
Not sayin Ason, is like a duck of disco
Or a disco duck, I'm strictly hip hop
Yo, Ason, what's up? I can't stop...
Wu-Tanging, flipping the script and
You could test my skills, but niggas must be trippin
Coked up from sniffin, you're the one who's riffin
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
You start to flip, now ya slip, cuz you're slippin
While you sleep I be the God on point, like Scottie Pippen
As I, jump on stage, cold flip a rip a show
Strip or rip a ho, ready like Bo
Jackson while I'm still taxin, I'm maxin
Relaxin, sittin backs and, laying tracks and
Again and again when I rock this jam
I wanna see 'em up in the air, throw up your hand
Introducin, the one-man band
A child that's wild, now with the style, couldn't stand
Niggas wanna jump, then stepped, to the center
Of the rhyme inventor, MC tormentor
You get jacked and slapped, across the MC map
I laugh at ya ass, on a horse shack
Come on through I black and blue your whole crew
Then I get rudie with the Hong Kong Phooey
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, MC killer
Money maker, Brooklyn, Shaolin style
That I lay down like tile
Gotta hit you up, one blaow, so you better come down...




I wrote this verse on the 25th
But half a yall just ain't gon get it till the 26th
Im here to analyze ya shooter
Like Im Kenny Smith
But I aint Kenny
Kenny can shoot it
But can he spit?
This aint for morons
Hashtag NEW Yiddi trick, and oxymorons
Fat broads who skinny dip
The War Report on
Better come with your sword on
I hit ya with that Cee-Lo Green
You know that short arm
The people caught on (wait)
I meant to say the Peoples Court on (wait)
For the record I hope record on (brake)
Before I wreck it
Too many styles to go on
Wu-Tang is for the children
Go get ya child support on


I aint tryna bring the city back
And all that pretty boy rap
Aint where Im really at
Besides rappers dont really ride
They piggy back - Ill trade them all
To have 2Pac & Biggie back
Facts. Dont give me dap
Dont want your pity want Fifty Fifty
Just give me that
Want every penny both Hanz on
How many that?
A black president
White house, what's really rap?
We not so friendly at my house (clicky clack)
If necessary, pet cemetery, ya kitty cat  Wont let em eat
Cause my other problems too many rats
Ya boy a beast on this mic Jack
Da ratchet tryna peel (pill) ya like Mike Jack
Call that thriller a nite cap
Take a moment to suck it up
But make it brief nobody cared if ya cow died
Dont make it beef
Rap game we own it
We really in these streets
You rap lames is homeless
You really in the streets


I aint tryna bring the city back
And all that pretty boy rap
Aint where Im really at
Really how sillys that?
Besides rappers dont really
Ride they piggy back
Ill trade them all
To have 2Pac & Biggie back



Uhh, hahah, Ruff Ryders niggas (all my niggas)
(All aboard!) Blood in blood out
Funk Doc, Sheek Luc', Meth-Tical (whattup niggas?)
Yo, yo, aiyyo yo


Soon as I cop the nine, I pop the nine
When I take it out the box, I represent LOX
Now when I flow, you hit the rewind button
So I charge out more, want it all at the door
Fuck heat, Sheek walk around with an oven
Who you gonna kill with that little Foreman grill?
How its gon' look when I come through your block?
Sheek, Funk Doc, Meth on top
Porsche, 300 horse fly by
Back open pumpin "How High?" (How High)
Yeah, can y'all see that (See that)
Bitch you can call me what you want, 'cuz "I'll Be Dat" (Be dat)
Get off my dick, I don't care about no jewels
Long as the condo's paid and the truck I choose
I'm tellin y'all niggas, if its not double R
I'mma spell my name out on the side of your car


Come and Ruff Ryde with us
If you wanna get high with us
If you wanna get down with us
Come on nooooowwwww
Come and Ruff Ryde with us
If you wanna get high with us
If you wanna get down with us
Come on nooooowwwww


I got a twin cam exhaust connected to the jaw
A five speed clutch on my paw when I write
I glow like the pegs in Lite-Brite
3000 volts of lightning when you fly the right kite
Me and Meth be Hennessy, two ice cubes
We can draw (choose your weapons) or do I choose?
When I choose the grip, one shot lose your hip
I hope your shoes fit for this move and pick
I avalanche your camp with, ten feet of snow
I'm cold blooded, my fam half-eskimo
My flows move like indo;
Turn ten nickels to ten loads, outta ten sto's
Ride the crash course, do the math on it
Swizz Beats you can ride Amtrak on it
But I'm on it, grillin with George Foreman
Ya peeps is at the Grammy Awards cornin
The ice, the fat wallet son, I want it
And the helicopter warmin before mornin
Def Jam nigga, Redman nigga
Got - "fuck ya momma" on my sweat band nigga
You tough guys'll get smacked in the club
COme with the gun I bought from Mack in the club
Its P-P-P from Bricks to Brook-nam (C'mon)
(C'mon) Bring me some more ass to whoop on




Look what the cat dragged in
Underground dweller from the cellar bring terror
Scoop a high yellow Cinderella, Meth forever
Never rush a rhyme, hope to never bust my nine
But if I have to, I have to, it's all in the mind
I stay ahead of time while y'all fallin behind
Tryin to relight ya lime
It's a crime when I drop bomb lines designed
To tick, tick, BOOM blow your mind
Yeah me, M-E-T, H, the O, the D
Can't be done, like tryin to find a penny in the sea
Nigga run for cover son go and get them guns
Y'all ain't from here, don't try to come around here gettin ones
Swizz Beat the track in the head, but I instead
Pull my dart gun and bust sixteen until it's dead
I'm the game, all of my dogs be off the chain
Yellin Wu.. Tang, Wu.. Tang






We will fight till the night is done
We will live our lives tonight as one
We will live our lives tonight as one, one


I'm a bad mother, shut your mouth
Insanity, DVD, how I stretch 'em out
What the stress about? INS best out
Fact, you knew that before he left the house
Fresh at the produce section
Gaze at my shine like a showroom necklace
Death wish, stepping in Deck's direction
I'm checking niggas like test questions


Across 110th now, cross Belmont and Montauk
Camera hawk hawks the sidewalk
When they get to flexing muscle niggas bust you
Hustlers do you, gave you your first toolie
Cutting out of school to pump your first loose leaf
Think graduate to wait, take it out of state, duct tape
Anything of pulse and heroin
Emcees frozen, cuban link chains are golden
I'm ownin' everywhere I'm holdin' it up, to keep it raw
Math here, I got 'em keep coming back for more


Yo, man, I'm so turned up, all the marijuana burned up
Y'all don't want the drama, word up
The Wu first up, the game is the world versus us
Y'all was good 'til the world heard us
Y'all ain't want them Clan birds up
Y'all don't want your man served up, that'll get the fans worked up
Homie really wanna play, stir it up
I'mma catch me a wave, surfs up
Gliding on the track like this, make me wanna act like this
Make me wanna smack that trick
Make a killer really wanna yap that kid
If he opens up his yap that's it




Mass of minerals in a glass house
Playing 4th the Wu neutrinos will blast out
Letting out verbal thunder bolts
Until the world attract old and younger folks
Charge with the vitality of magnetism
In large reality with massive rhythm
The manual without technical part
From the beginning give off an electrical spark


I respect you if you respect me
Everything's for real, WTC
No fake ass shit, don't front the Remy
Break bread, never have pockets empty
Let's get it, flip it up then we can spend it
The money train, Killa Beez on your brain
W's everywhere, one on your chain
Homeboys for life, please don't change
You can hide at my house, it ain't no thing
If you see the pigs, don't say jack
Call me original, don't say cap
I'm on the low, might be at the murder
Holding off the place y'all cats never heard of
Yeah, chicks wanna peep me out
Nasty ass, want me to pee in their mouth
But now I'm out, about to link with sticks




Bang a few notes up top, we call it beast mode
Forget the street codes, show you like a deep throat
It gets rougher, you suffer from the heat stroke
Blast barrels, embrace my leaf smoke
Park Hillians radio for back up
Polish your act up, nigga need a back up
Syrup in my cup, no cut, straight up
UG's on the court, never miss a lay up


When the emcees came to live out their names
Some rode the bus, some rode the train
Some motherfuckers wish they never came
When they met the nine swordsmen of Wu-Tang
Nine Maseratis pulls up to this party hard
Body, the party is filled with Godbody
There out of shape models coming through with those bottles
And double D's please, all eyes follow
Pass me a bucket of ice, that's nice
Hit with the vodka, what you say proper
I drink with the copper, show up in a chopper
Stop her, she wanna have a mnage  trois
I can tell by the bra, RZA Ra-KZA-Keem is all is Allah
Do you wish or wish upon a star? Do you wish or wish upon a star?






Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (roll it up niggas)
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (4:20, y'all, it's time, it's time)
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (it's been a long time for this man
Niggas been sleeping on the kid, man, everybody got some sideway shit to say)
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (Carlo! Know what I'm saying, man? Yeah)


Fast or slow mo, oh no, Meth done made a killing
Call the po-po, oh niggas is squealing, oh, y'all ain't feeling
Niggas no more, the bigger they are, harder they go though
Good pussy put a hump in my back like Quasimoto
Hah, my sex ain't homo, season vet, hold the adobo
Got rappers on that low carb diet, y'all can't get no dough
I keep a low pro, file, excuse me as I get smoked out
Put hands on these niggas, then put the roach out
Go head, I'm wishing you would, ask if it's good
Man, this Tarzan shit in the woods, my shit is hood, bitch
That means I'm hood rich, telling you lies
Straight out the pull-pit, it's like Merrill Lynch I'm on that bullshit
Real spit, money come first, and even worse
You need all your toes & fingers to count up what I'm worth, trick
So when I blow a smoke cloud in your face, just take a hint
Dick, you crowding my space, it's Mr. Meth, pa


It's 4:20, roll up, nigga getting smo-ked out
No seeds, California weed have you choked out
No doubt, roll up, which rims spoked out
4:20 mean either you roll up or roll out


Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it


So on and so on, I flow on
Power to our people, get your smoke on
And I'm so gone, off, that sour diesel
Hard to hold on, but hold on, it's like I'm Pretty Toney
With that robe on, got terrorist shook, because I'm so bomb
The hood, put, me in position, I'm in the kitchen
With that cook book, the service I'm giving, birds they vision
Not a good look, told ya my nigga, Tical deliver
Hook or crook, lots of asses to kick, wish I had a bigger foot
Yeah, taking it there, hating who care
Y'all stay out my mental, I got killas waiting in here
To get you, as I sharpen my pencils, tear apart instrumentals
Fuck it, y'all niggas is pussy, so is the dick that sent you
RZA, we done it again, Co-D occassion
Here's to short skirts and Ol' Dirt McGirt, okay, then
Let's get it popping, like it ain't nothing to get it popping
The big and rotten's the city, too good to be forgotten

 - 2X


The rap game won't like me
You can tell that a nigga is shiesty
If I die, my second born'll be like me
Slide dick to your wifey
Never know your baby boy just might be
Quick to rob a jack, he's so icey, stay dressed to kill
From the Hill, never ran, never will
Attitude, like, fuck you still, I see you missing the point
This is not a rap song, you get clapped on
Bullets break the bone, like the joint, call you out your name
Disrespect ya moms, spit on your dame
Go public, then, shit on your fame, you overlooking the fact
Where you from, is where we at
And y'all don't want no, parts, in that that
Caught your verse for sale, but real niggas don't shoot & tell
We'd rather do the time and rot in the cell


The inner outer state, bi-coastal smoker
Inhale, Cali piff with a swift of glaucoma
Black jeans, black Timbs, black Benz roaster
Smoke rise, out the sun roof when I roll up
Verrazano, with no relation to Gravano
Carlo, shots are hollow, still cop a bottle
And pour some out, moment of silence, then I swallow
I'm still alive, and still the sun'll come out tomorrow
Shine shine shine, and grind, cuz it's money on my mind
And I'm moving like my life is on the line
For the bullshit, I really got no time, a full clip
Really gon' let ya niggas know what's on my mind
When ya getting out of line, have them choppers lit up
You won't need a camera phone to get the picture
Chalk down, tape around, body bag zipped up
Carlo Verrazano, you can call me mister








 Make it butter
 I'm gonna Bankhead bounce
 No doubt
 Aiyyo watch your mouth
 Aiyyo, one two three four five six seven, blaze the hot
 Trizack that sound like heaven
Seven six five four three two one
C'mon, Meth-Tical, come and get some


Playing my position, hot Nick, son
This one, for all the sick ones, infliction
Poisonous darts sickening, best believe
Finger itchin' with two broke legs, now I'm trippin'
On MC's cliche, shot that ricochets
Start trouble bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me, G-O-D, no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly
Tap your jaw from my Punch Buggy sunning you
Got you shittin' in your last Huggie, running who
Fuckin' punk, get a speed bump coming through
A single shot make yo meat lump, respect Wu


Aiyo I put it on a nigga, shitted on a nigga
Turn a Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (explodes)
While you got sent up I was hitting your ex ho
Shit I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chickenheads gobblin'
Shit I'm driving in, come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city, from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the gypsy
When I approach rappers be taking notes
I drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat
Absolute, I love to burn to the roots
I keep comin' til your pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you fuck you my attitude is anemic


I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I snatch your crown with ya head still attached to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beating niggas to death and beating dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough, I start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, "Yo, how many rhymes you got?"
I think I'll go on for more Milleniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run to, when I confront ya
Nigga, I call your bluff like you had a phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild?
Who wanna act fly and get shot down with a surface-to-air missile?
I take em on in all shapes, sizes, and forms, and spit on
Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin' a hundred when I'm blunted
And I give it to any nigga that want it


Stay out the dark, cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you, dog, believe that
Where we at, do you value your life, as much as your possessions
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, cause it's, better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put you somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on
You ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
You'se a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby
So I can hit you up on Front Street, you think I'm sweet
Want heat, one deep, leave him behind, front seat


Aiyyo, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Blaze the hot trizack, shine like heaven
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
Come on Mr. Smith, come get some


When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords, I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewhere cryin on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
I'ma do this shit for free this time this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis ("LL Cool J is hard")
Every little boy wanna pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like picking up a ball, playing with Mike
Swingin at Ken Griffey or challenging Roy to a fight
Snapping, you amateur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team touring overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringing a tiger cub to his knees
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't wanna borrow that, you wanna idolize
And you don't wanna make me mad nigga you wanna socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth don't ever step out of line
LL Cool J nigga, greatest of all time



HUHHHHHH!
 Def Jam, No Limits
 No Limit
 Def Squad
 Wu-Tang, and beyond

	Aiyyo, one two three four five six seven
		Blaze the hot
	trizack that sound like heaven
		Seven six five four three two one
		My mon Meth-Tical come and get some


Playin my position, hot Nixon
This one, for all the sick ones, confliction
Posionous darts sickening, best believe
Finger itchin with two broke legs, now I'm trippin
On MC's cliche, shot that ricochets
Start trouble bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me, G-O-D no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly, tap your jaw
From my Punch Buggy sunnin you
Got you shittin in your last Huggie, runnin who?
Fuckin punk, get a speed bump comin through
A single shot make your knees knock, respect Wu


Aiyyo I put it on a nigga, shit it on a nigga
Turnin Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (explodes)
While you got set up I was hittin your ex hoe
Shit I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chickenheads gobblin
Shit I'm drivin in, come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city, from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the chin see
When I approach rappers be takin notes
I drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat
Absolut, I love to burn to the roots
I keep comin til your pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you fuck you my attitude is anemic


I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I snatch your crown witcha head still attatched to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beatin niggas to death and beatin dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough, I start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, "Yo, how many rhymes you got?"  I think I'll go on
For more Milleniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run ta, when I confront ya
Nigga, I call your bluff like you had a phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild, who wanna act fly and
Get shot down with a surface-to-air missile
I take em on in all shapes sizes and forms and spit on
Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty?  I'm already doin a hundred
When I'm blunted and I give it to any nigga that want it


Stay out the dark, cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you dawg, believe that
Where we at, do your value your life, as much as your possesions?
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, cause it's, better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put your somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
You'se a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby
So I can hit you up on front teeth, you think I'm sweet?
Want heat?  One deep, leave him behind, front seat


Got my mic on, it's time to get rowdy
Got homies from the N-O to the N-Y, Bout It Bout It
I break bread with the ballers
Professional killers, and shot callers
I got game from the South to the West to the East
To the middle now remember me
A young nigga with the gold teeth bumpin
Keep the crowd jumpin, gotta say something
UNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGHHH, now have a Coke and a smile
The party don't stop but it get buckwild
Pass the Hennessey and weed, just blaze one
See a shorty, let's play one
For the cookies you can't be a rookie
I'm a No Limit Soldier, that's why they book me
Master P rock bells, hell
But I gotta give it up to my homey LL

 four
		 seven
		Blaze the hot trizack
	Shine like heaven
		Seven  four
		 one
	Come on Mr. Smith, come get some!


When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed (yeah, word up)
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewher cryin on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
I'ma do this shit for free this time this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis ("LL Cool J is hard")
Every little boy wanna pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like pickin up a ball, playin with Mike
Swingin at Ken Griffey or challengin Roy to a fight
Snappin, you ameteur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team tourin overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringin a tiger cub to his knees (uhh)
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't wanna borrow that, you wanna idolize
And you don't wanna make me mad nigga you wanna socalize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth don't ever step out of line
LL Cool J nigga, greatest of all time




We both know, that our love will grow
And forever, will be you and me...


Give me a woman that get down for me, my one and only
That don't fuss or fuck around on me, or leave me lonely
Not just a honey, but a homey, just wanna hold me
Cuz she got alotta love for me, and put it on me
If I need that, plus she understand me when I beat that
It's sweet like candy, this time, I might just eat that
You steal my heart, sweetheart, then you can keep that
Let's bar hop and find us a spot where we can chief at
Push the seats back, you got the kinda body niggas beep at
Try to speak at, but get no feedback
Sophisticated, Miss Highly Edumicated
Living well, lady that made it, type of woman you stay with




Give me a queen that respects a "king", just like Coretta
Get everything except the ring, for worse or better
Even through the stormy weather, rain, sleet, snow
Whatever, see if it go down, we go together
Like Twix bars, ain't no problem that we can't fix, ma
You ain't gotta sugar my tank, or key the kid car
Cuz broken hearts leave big scars, when emotions get hit hard
Niggas get drunk and hit the strip bar
But that ain't even ya man's style, even back as a manchild
That's where I stood, and where I stand now
I'm throwing rocks at your window pane
Trying to bang, girl, like injure pain, you know the game




No matter what we go through (what we go through)
I'll be there for you (there for you)
I'll never let you down, I'll just hold you down, oh-oooh
No matter where we be (where we be)
I'll do it all again (all again)
The ups and down, I'll hold you down, oh-oooh


Give me a woman that get down for me, my one and only
She don't fuss or fuck around on me, or leave me lonely
Not just a honey, but a homey, just wanna hold me
Cuz she got alotta love for me, and now I gotta
Lotta love for her, might even take a slug for her
And everywhere we go, pull out that red rug for her
Yeah, them back rubs in the bathtub, got me cleaning my act up
I'm ready to shack up, now that's love


Nobody can love you like me boy
I'll promise to be your only girl
Don't ever leave, just stay
You will be down for me, anyway
Ahhhhhhhhhh, you and me together, baby





Smoke More Grass


Bitch!
Brick City, yo
Yo, yo Funk Doc straight lunatic since young
I ate paint chips the rare moon
That pair mics, my maintenance
I battle you and then me and Meth exchange shifts
For money, to your house arrest anklet
I take it all, if not, here's a thousand
Bricks, be shooting fair ones with bail bonds men
I'm constant, on that paper chase
Blow zip codes from bricks to 8-1-8
Doc serve til you lickin' the plate
Battle royal, in the ring smoking like Doc out of oil
Fire thrown to the roof of you apartment
Hit 95 then I hide with the Waltons
Down South, the forty-four feela
I'm a Dolo nigga, you a Polo nigga
I'm an Uptown shopper, you a Soho nigga
Westside highway running, homo nigga


I'm the sultan of the ghetto
The homicidal aficionado
I empty niggas out like Cristal bottles, uh
When I battle, I'm breaking Bentleys down to gravel
I got the heat right here, we ain't got to travel
I'm bigger than producers, I figured out you losers
I knew my longevity confuse ya
Big paper game, come on run into these flames
Recognize the power of the royal King James
Phantom Menace, that's why niggas make faces like they drinking Guinness
When they realize I'm not finished
I've been paid, I've been platinum, been spittin', uh
Been eatin', been ballin' and you know I'm shittin'
Platinum links, chinky-eyed blonde haired honeys sippin' rainbow colored drinks
Black thugs with white minks, ready to jack the brink
Bend your little wifee over help her stretch out the kinks
That's why ya niggas freeze when I step up in the building
The Godfather's here giving blessings to his children
Carats shine, the world all mine
Can't believe these cats is poppin' shit about papers in their rhymes
Or bodies they collect, black Gotti shot a tech
Them gangsta visions will have you ass up in an ambulance
Cats ain't live, look up in my eyes
We can do this one more time, I'll let you decide
The Alize swigger, I clock twelve figgas
Think Giuliani's rough I got some real shit for niggas
Never been defeated, niggas retreated
Made the choice to be seated until my mission's completed
Get loose, get loose, Method Man get loose
What the world gonna do when my dogs get loose?
(Blaze one) Blaze one (Blaze one) Blaze One
Blaze, blaze, blaze one


Now four corners, four seasons
Four MC's with four reasons to bring this game to its knees
And while you down there, suck my dick
My whole motto is fuck it
Hit the smoke shop and blow my budget
MC's abusing my bitch, using my shit
I'm hanging off the roof with one hand, losing my grip
Now y'all don't wanna see me do that, now do you?
Go straight cuckoo and terrorize rap, do you?
I do my best work stressed out and under pressure
Deep inside the mind is where you'll find my buried treasure
I'm still wild, still Tical
Still gritty style, foul, crimi-niminal, individual
Sing a song of sixpence
Pocket full of chits
Too many rappers be on John Gotti's dick
Now this is something that we don't rehearse
Put that rap shit second, and hip-hop first


Easy, ain't Nann niggas spitting like me
Nor Murderers motherfuckin' INC
Niggas will pass me, look me in the face, ask me
Are y'all really holdin' weight or did somebody gas me?
Ja be the myth, Reggie hand me the fifth let me explain
Your lil' man made me give him a lift
So you ridin' with gangstas
I'm up to a whole lot of other shit
Murderers is the clique, niggas can't deal with

Lesson tonight by the four-four
Niggas want more than a little bit, hot shit
L.L. an Red
Ja Rule with Hot Nix I'm the best at that shit
So bitches explain this
Who ride dick so well, head game from hell
I love making them yell, my name

From a city that is known to do crazy things
You already Im heavy yall stay in your lane

Graffiti some, we spray cans where Cory from

Kidding so it shall be written the story done




Fuck you losers while they fake jacks I make maneuvers
Like Method, Sticking up crews, bumping some Wu shit
Im all seasons goose down hoodie and snorkel
Whatever, whatever you want Ill off you
Im awful, unlawful, I aint the one to talk too
Thats word to uncle Ghost, Ill cook your waffle
Riddle me down, Im mentally that
Freddy the villain is here you remember me back
Felony killers or kitties. I chill and trapped in the belly
No telling me how high and they feel I be strapped
Waiting for murderers some type of burglar and chomping
And murder burglar upon us some karmas when the curb with
Turbulent, been a veteran what you still a virgin
Dangerous grounds, we stain the clowns Im burgeon goon platoon
Some loon buffoons refurnishing, womb for tombs
Kaboom, you doomed, no surgeon you know




You could never break me down, Im built for this
Crown fitted for a king Im victorious
It's survival of the fit as we are warriors
For the red, black and green vanglorious
Godbody-Cypher-Divine, dangerous minds
Spontaneously combine, its the sign of the times
All things must come to an end, Imma ball until then
No fade away shots Im going hard at the rim
Might rupture my Achilles heel, chasing this hundred mill
Brake pads gone just lost my third wheel
On my last leg stay kicking like old cabbage and boiled eggs
Known to hold a grudge wont stop till they all dead
Eyes bloodshot red bottle to the head damn forgot what I just said
Eyes blood, fuck it just on to the next one
I been around the world never forgot where I came from






Man, I don't know what they smokin'
Our rappers must be on that Lindsay Lohan
I think that snow bunny got 'em open
Your 'erb smell funny and I funny like we jokin'
Look, if it ain't about this money, don't approach 'em
If you do try and play, I got a K that can coach 'em
Pen game, poke 'em like an inmate enforcer
I'm for that, it's nothin' like a doormat, you're welcome
Huh, shout-out to Jadakiss and French
I got two French vanillas French kissin', that's a pimp
If my goon don't stretch 'em wit' the weapon, that's a ten
Little meth in your possession, that's possession wit' intent, bruh
It's a hard knock life, but we find a way
And we still find the time to write a rhyme a day
I'm tryin' to send my babies to college
Why you rappers babysittin' your pockets?
I want your life or your wallet
Brr, that's the sound of the roscoe
Mexicans is vatos, skinny jeans is flacko
That means I'm tight wit' you, I'm ready to fight wit' you
Please, and that don't mean I'm tryin' to be polite wit' you
Nah, see, I ain't even try and griped wit' you
So take your team if they ain't tryin' to lose they life wit' you
Back down while I'm puttin' this MAC down
But only for a limited time, homie, so act now
Bruh, keep it a hundred and a Backwood
Who else could think on an empty stomach? I'm that good
Far from the slave ship, just far from basic
Started from the basement, now we're y'all replacements
Rap star Belly, magazine, who sixteen?
Son, you all ready, headshot, all beggin'
Man in the myth, take a stand, any stand on the Fifth
I'm tryin' to hold it down, I hold the Clan
Get a grip, Lord, from this jump I got my hand on the ripcord
And I ain't tryin' to bite the hand off your bit Ford
Now y'all done got the Method Man on some rich border
I'm gettin' paid and I'm full
Y'all sheep for the wolves, we gon' eat 'til we good
Y'all don't speak when you should, ain't no peace in my hood

The burners and the stash, we 'bout the cash
We got females that got it like that
The golden childs that bone the crowd
See, niggas in the place that bit my style
Well, I'm a singer, dancer, we bulletproof brothers
Wu-Tang got the answer
Cause if I had a chance to do it again
I will still keep the heat in my pants-uh


Y'all be nice to the crackheads, everybody listen up
I shot one of my bitches, the ho ain't trick enough
Word life to big screen Don, tapping dustbones out
With starwriters like I fucked Celine Dion
Stuck everything that's the god's honest beyond
We airin' niggas out, that's the type shit that we on
Official Wu-Tang headbanger
Flood your space with big waves like you did in Sri Lanka


I drink heavy gallons of cru, play the big part
Niggas got squid on the grill, selling kids Clarks
Finesse notes, yo, the Guess on with the vest pose
Yellow swede one matching hat with the grey gun
Niggas be rhymin' for nothing, then my team pull up
We all throw down y'all broke niggas stay frontin'
Lines come digital stupid, plus ain't got no jewelry on
Bet I'm still live and I'm coopin'
Two of my silverbacks run through a pack of your wolves
Front on react, we're sippin' Cognac  relax dude
Know I'm with these cracks dude


Yo, 1-2, Dirt McGirt
Solid tone smith with 6th shots, lick shots
Leave your head like a Shaolin monk with 6 dots
Brooklyn Zoo, Zoo
Brooklyn Zoo


It's the return of Bin Laden, grab your armor
Smash pretty boy niggas, crush their karma
Eat bones with alligators, roll deep with my entourage
My whole crew's fresh out the bars
Diggler AKA the Cab Driver
Drop him off in the middle of fire
Dirty Island, drag bodies to the Murderland
Knock niggas out hurtin' my hand


I remember in the elevator we was playin' corners
Now we play the corners and the cops is stayin' on us
Staten's where the war is
Where the court system's running out of warrants
Where TNT be jumping out the Taurus
For real I can't call it
You see I love Lucy cause she Lawless
Exactly like that 1-0-3-0-4 is
Snitch niggas swallow your tongue
Already know the island I'm from
And y'all don't want no problems with them


We got a history full of lightning victories
Conceptual breakthrough, it ain't no mystery
Long vision from giants in every way
Rap czars, magnificent flows for every day
From the East to the 'ville, from the West to the hills
Incredible rhymes, encouraging skills
From rat packs, the smallest crews were enormous
We hit 'em fast with an effortless performance
MCs start fleeing in flocks
Especially those that's more sensitive to heat and shock


We grindin' down to the bone, my name grounded in stone
I'm Mr. Violence we loungin' with chrome
Mr. Violence we lounge in his home, hit the housing on Rome
Shining like a hundred thousand in stones
Move mountains with poems, got a jones for dinero
1-6-zero my songs we throwin' elbows
The hoes cling, sho thing, we know kings
Only dime dikes with minds right, we choose Queens


Yeah, we wild like rockstars who smash guitars
Yo son split his face with the toast, he ain't ghost
It's no joke iron coat rifle with the stroke
One toke brains float, shot to the throat
Before the smoke hit, witness the killing, chilling crime scene
Body on the block, eyes open from the shock
Of being popped in the neck
Yet he still held a lit cigarette between his fingers
Danger when you step into the chamber with the Masta
Disaster, gotta blast ya cause I have to


The rat pack is back from the island of Stat'
Leave you cursed dust, cause you worship the Gat
The first one to snap drunk off the Smirnoff
Blow the bouncer's ear off, let him floss he the boss
Handcuffed, to the turntables like Wizard Theodore
See it's pure, let it rain pearly ounces
Bang him with the thing that hang from the trousers
You don't want no drama, I'm flaming fast
That nigga jumped up and did the Damon Dash




Yo, this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
For all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it

Yo, in the housing, thousands seen early graves
Victims of worldly ways, memories stays engraved
All my live brothers, is locked down with high numbers
The young hunger, blind to these lies, they die younger
In this New World the Order slaughter men, women, and children
Ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in
The projects, lifeless like a vietnam vet
Constant war, sever threats of enemy conquest
Crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble
Streets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble
Vivid thoughts, Devils resort to trick knowledge
They kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars
I know the pain the game bring, I did the same thing
Spaced out in the staircase, performing a sting
It's hard to keep control, I bless those who seek a scroll
Trying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
Not a role model, I walk a hard road to follow
I sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
The gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole
Mentally they fold, and they eventually sold
Their life and times, deadly like the virus design
But too, minute to dilute, the scientist mind


You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way


A voice cries from the wilderness of the North
A representation of the families that lost one
All victims of incarceration
Or other divisions of the family structure
Youths are injected with serums that leads
To skin irritations, babies being born with
Disfigurations, experimentations
On their faces there bear worry-ations
Of mothers that carry the pain
Of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
Fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
It lightly begins to rain screams of terror
Are hidden by the passing trains
This can't be little Hussein, his uncle cried
As he drops to his nephew's side, holding his cane
Just give me a name, of who has inflicted this
Bitter sickness, and left us to witness


Yeah, yo
Curses from war, innocent blood spills for days
Soothe in godly ways, hands, solemn in praise
Tree of life, more precious than rubies, golden game
The wise shall flourish inherit, Halls of Fame
Crime visions in my blood got me, locked in prison
While we die hard living people whine about religion, vision
Blow, spin, and sin and killing what's revealing
It's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen
Zero process, progress, become the hunted
America's most wanted, good life flaunted, want it
Some love the speed, some satisfy a need
Some want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed
The strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed
One flew astray, and it caught my little seed
Can it be, the ice savage, trife life, made me grab the knife
The righteous man was beat with many stripes, pipes
Take in my energy, breath and know the rest
Cause the good die young and the hard die best


You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way


Y'all bitches love dances, and pulling down your pants
While your man's on tour, your spending up his advances
Your friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke, and suck dick
The whole projects is trapped in stench
You either high school drop-outs, one to three cop-outs
Fifteen years old, shorty ass and top out
Ninety-nine cent beer drinking pussy stinking
Fucking so much your ass and titties start shrinking
New World Order slave trade, minimum wage, Medicaid
Can a devil fool a Muslim nowadays
Inside my lab, I'm going mad
Took two drags off the blunts, and started breaking down the flag
The blue is for the Crips, the red is for the Bloods
The whites for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs
Or the slugs that ignites, through the night, by the dawn
Early light, why is sons fighting for the stripe


As we dwell through this concrete hell, calling it home
Mama say, take your time young man and build your own
Don't wind up like your old dad
Still searching for them glory days he never had
So many bad want to scheme for American dream, no more kings
The cash rule everything now, we going down
These babies looking up to us, it's up to us
The Million Man March MC's, get on the bus
But envy, greed, lust, and hate, separate
Though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
No longer, brothers, we unstable
Like Kane when he slew Abel, killing each other


You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way




Wake up... wake up
Wake up...


Wake up, get a hold of your life, go get your cake up
The motto in the streets is you eat, or you get ate up
Straight up, you tired of waiting, go get your weight up
My peoples tired of waiting for reparations to pay us
Screaming Jesus can save us, I, I get the Bentley if I save up
But that's just another trick to enslave us
Push the minimum wages
Put, put our fathers up in them cages
Then watch out when mother struggled to raise us
But, but my ambition won't let me live in this poor condition
That doesn't care about color, creed, or your religion
Priests, politicians gotta listen to opposition
From my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in
From my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in


Allah said to save the babies from the cold
Pour wisdom in the cup so the truth overflows
Still, knowledge is that bread that keeps us well-fed
Old time religion will not bring us satisfaction
Without action now who can disagree with me?
God is not a mystery, there's nowhere in history
That you could show and prove to me
But still you face east and nod your head to me religiously
I'm G-O-D, to infinity, for real


The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me


Poor reparations, the Bush administration
Unequality, martial law, segregation
False hood, false teaching, false education
Now's the time for us to come amongst this nation
They deceiving us, they don't believe in us
They believe in that Cream like Julius Caesar
I'm like Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X with the heaters
Ripping the chains of the remains of all of the leaders
Never worship the image of evil swine eaters
I'm on the back of the bus with two fine divas
We in the jungle of life, but never jungle fever
I'm God-body all day long, spiritual life lessons
That I recite in this song
Trying to wake up everybody, can't we all get along?
For all my people that's out there persevering through the storm
Black fist, Staten Island, stand up, stand strong
Penetrate through the gate and bring the Clan along


The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me


Wake up and realise the times
That we living in the world is getting more iller than ever
Thought we was chillin', striving change for the better
But it was a dream like Martin Luther
He had a vision that could move a mountain
Protect one another, that's world to my brother Malcolm
As-salamu alaykum, alaykum as-salam
We want justice, police supposed to protect and serve
And then they shoot us down like wild animals
The nerve of them cold-hearted killers
With blue suits slaying our black youth
The earth cries from all the blood that's being spilled
We need a solution fast, get InshAllah bill
Let me educate them, translate it meaning God's will
It goes all in together, together how we are
To stand with a plan, provided we down to fall
And that's the Willie Lynch tactics that separated the masses
Taught us all to think backwards




The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me

We gonna change the world (x5)





Ooh yea I'm on my way to get some hay

To have fun so I hook her and I treat her
Like one. Bust it! Look in tha local
Project, when I buzz her; on the 5th
Rather brother make a dozen? Floor she
Had a child but because I'm half poor kids
Buy dread the next door. He don't know
The meaning of child care, 'cause she's on
Welfare looking at..? So raps the same
YearSo I took advantage of dat before it

Let me tell you something my friend
Hope is a dangerous thing
Hope can drive a man insane
Its got no use on the other side
You better get used to that idea


I got cotton mouth
You know how it go
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)


Look
I wonder if I fail just how many will go to hell
I'm trying to send a message, fuck how many I sell
Hoping that my lessons of goodness riches prevail
Not saying I'm perfect, say I'm harder than that
But I got standard from when niggas rocked a starter cap
And I got morals for myself, I'm living by a code
And I arrive for you even if you hardly drove
Figure that, my intuition be gone on expeditions
I suffer from crazy visions but I don't need a psych camp
See Einstein and Newton and all the greatest minds
We ever had in time were crazy too
I turn on my lamp
Enlighten you even if you're frightened to
I'll sensei that ass you can get to riping dude
And help you find the right path like a big Nissan
Pull you in the right direction, you ain't got a leash on
Searching for the wealth homie, I'm trying to get my feast on
Trying to get some ladies on my Johnson like Keshawn
Boy just put the beat on and I'll float away
But I ain't flowing with the current yah I flow astray
I'm swimming in a new direction this you won't predict
Its like I'm dropping out, can't fuck with this school of fish
Cause if I take the current then I'm just like everybody else
And niggas is so similar they can't think for themselves
Oh no


I got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal
I been waiting on this all day
I got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal baby
I just want to parlay
I got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal
Niggas doing it the wrong way
I got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal


Let's take them back
Check the old school flow
Like water see I sorta got a Rick James aura
Let the whole school know the order
Yeah
Can't tell you what an old fool know
But anything organic, that's a whole food store
Taking nothing for granted
If you hoes too slow too bad
When one door open they close two more
I ball and dragon y'all
That Goku glow
Stash grams in ceiling fans
I don't do blow or pills
My 40 below's giving them chills
I can drive a hard bargain
And never give them the wheel
That's ill, Park Hill
Never ran, never will
Listen king
I jack queen if you don't tell her the deal
Black or white
Its so Cruella de Vil
This is dog 101, now give Cruella the steel, blaw
Meth
There ain't nothing Beverly Hills
About me or my team
We living legends for real


Look
I got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal
I been waiting on this all day
I got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal baby
I just want to parlay
I got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal
Niggas doing it the wrong way
I got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal


I grew impatient and no longer could be vacant
See a (?)
Lay it down like I'm her patient
Got to feel like I'm the one
Guess that puts me in The Matrix
See I'm the boss so I just call you up for cancellation
I'm aching
For sweet love and back breaking
That's what I tell the universe when we communicating
So when we have a baby that's the time for celebration
And roll the trees up, take me on a vacation
Picture me just standing on the corner of Magnolia
Strolling though the projects with my niggas man I told ya
And you ain't standing next to me either
Cause they'll hold ya up
Hit you with the rope-a-dope
And have you feeling like a duck
Straight plucked
Fucking with me you straight fucked
Just lube up if you want to play it tough boy
Them armor piercing rounds will wet your ass up boy
But like a transvestite I keep my shit tucked boy


Got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal

Got to give it to them real
Got to tell you how I feel
What's the deal




Yeah, that's right everybody get some act right"


Awww shit! Ya know the name
Who flip flows like chessboards, there go the games
I'm drugs to the brain
Even on the 14th of February I ain't got no love for a lame
Back doin' my thang, right
Livin' the fast life
Bitch grab a seat at the bar, get you some act right
If that don't do it then rock, lets bring it back like
(Damn right everybody get some act right)
Ever since I came up, rappers done changed up
Put your walking shoes back on and step your game up
I'm getting through off the books, rock we banked up
Y'all don't think my shit off the hook, then y'all can hang on
I'm like a king that's so fresh so clean
I leave niggas like black coffee, no cream
Come inside the party fuck up the whole scene
(That's right everybody get some act right)


Get up get up, ya know what we came here for
What up what up, get your asses out on the floor
Come on come on, I've been away for far too long
Guess who's back and far too strong for ya niggas (now)
We feelin' good tonight, we hittin' 'dro like
We gettin money and gettin' honeys that flow like
My mic, my clothes, my life, my dough
(That's right everybody get some act right)


Ya damned if you do, ya damned if you don't
Step inside my Range and get blammed if you won't
My Clan in the joint, man we got it locked
Like whatever niggas got in the bank, I got it stopped
Y'all already know of my strength already growin'
In this game many may come but few are chosen
I don't usually do this, but keep the party going like
(Damn right everybody get some act right)
I get tips from B.I.G. and Pac when they blastin' the heat
If you's a rapper, don't ever ride the passenger seat
One to grow on
When up shit's creek, you get your roll on
Boy I never stop, I go on, so on and so on
Rappers can't fuck with me
My career's like somebody put glue in your chair and now you're stuck with me
I don't use pick up lines, I guess I'm just picky
(That's right everybody get some act right)




Extra, extra read all about it
Who shits they grounded, flies all around it
My trees don't doubt it, they green as a salad
All American Express I never leave home without it
I'll never go pop, Meth Man I'm bout it
Whenever I rock, the jam's over crowded
I'm never gonna stop, the fans won't allow it
(Damn right everybody get some act right)
Yo, get it you got it, if you got it then good
(There's a lot of rappers rappin' but not a lot of 'em could)
I'm that boy in the hood that told Red Riding Hood
There ain't nothin' but wars in my neck of the woods
So! Who's ready for MC Whoa
What's beef? Beef is what I got teeth for
I eat up everything on my plate then eat yours like
(That's right everybody get some act right)




Stand up! Staten Island, Lond Island get some act right
Every borough, New Jersey get some act right
Each state, west coast, east coast, dirty south, midwest get some act right
If it ain't well, it ain't right
If it ain't Meth, it ain't tight
So on that note like this, everybody get some act right




Damn... yo, yo


Woke up in the morning, like ten A.M
Walked passed the Listerine, went straight for the gin
Osama Bin Laden on my chinny chin chin


Yo, Meth, the mailman!


Yo, Ghost, let him in!


Will you sign, Mr. Ghostface, package for a friend, here
Right by the X, my bad, here's a pen


Gucci flip flops, I box my way to the kitchen
My keys is missin', my trees is missin'
No more parties, cuz Doc need to listen


Cuz something in my closet, go look (he's a pissin')
I cursed this bitch out, we be laid back


Half a box of cereal gone, my milk's warm
Thta's wrong, this is John John, pro and con phenomenon
Stretch with a morning yawn, party 'til the break of dawn
Ladies throw your faces on, sing it when the break come on


Ichi, ni, san, shi
Boats (suites) dough (beats)
No cat give you these, rap flow triple g's
Meth, Ghost, Killa Beez, you know we ride


Wu-Tang, the best rap group of all time
Rush little shotgun, rest around nine
Refrigerator, fish and sweets with no swine
Dirty and Meth guest room with four dimes
And U-G. had a Masta headache
Him and Genius flew back from, Uganda black, gettin' that cake
Where Divine at? Wine at
Tell a DJ to rewind that, Killa killed it wit a blind back
Dime sack, you know we blew that wit the cognac
Them bowling ball lead head niggas, we call them pawn yacks


I say my girl, like to party all the time, Ghost
Spend up my ends, every week, she always cryin' broke
Thank God it's friday, I just got paid
Feelin' good like I just got laid
The next drink's on me, instead of, oh God, you think O.G
White girls they comin' out, like they Pink on E
So you better get the party started, we get it crunk regardless
We got the 'dro and hypnotic, them kids is puffin' garbage
Is where it's crackin' at, Street is you passin' that?
Mami's is grabbin' ass, Johnny, I'm grabbin' back
You know my habitat, you know my peoples
If you wit me, where you at
There ain't nothin' compared to that, come on!


Ichi, ni, san, shi
Boats (suites) dough (beats)
No flows ill as these, M and Ghost, nigga please
Meth, Ghost, Killa Beez, you know we ride


I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cup, but they ain't chipped in
(These cheap muthafuckas be grown ass men
Tight muthafuckas finish your shit then they bounce off with them)
Come back again, drunk off your gin
And when they try to get you for they ends, that's no friend
That's no friend, eh, eh


Yeah, greedy muthafuckas, always wanna get high
But never wanna buy, first one to come to the party
Last one to leave, man, fuck all that
Aiyo, Mr. Streetlife, tell 'em where we come from man..



(feat. Melanie Rutherford)


If you like it (a lil' bit) I will give you a (a lil' bit)
If you want it (a lil' bit) you can have some more
Now that you spent it (a lil' bit) you can taste it a (a lil' bit)
If you like it (a lil' bit) you can have some more


Somebody tell honey I'm good, just like a licorice
Meth got 'em stuck in the hood just like a clitoris
Something like this track from Roc', ya'll, ridiculous
Don't touch her if I'm getting my rocks off, she ticklish
Now if I turn it up, shorty if you got a Dutch then we can burn it up
I ain't the type that need to drink to get his courage up
Half ya'll get a drink and think you murderers


Yo, I know you heard of us, Red & Meth, here take a photo
Walk in serious like Miguel Coto
Pimp in my mojo, swing in my logo
Def Squad, Wu-Tang, that's how I do things
Hit my blunt, baby I see your pussy a lil' bit
That's when I know it's on, it's time to head home
And we kick bitches out, around six in the morning



O.G. bubblegum, kush burn a bush
See you pussies like to eat out, need to learn to cook
Look, Meth wasn't eating 'em til I learned to juks
Tried to catch something, everytime I work a hook
Now if I crank it up, if I put it in the cup would you drink it up
Ever get caught up in a lie and try to change it up
You got a pocket full of lime, try and blaze it up


When I bust, I sip on that sir, fly to Miami and act up a lil' bit
I know eyes on me, when I count to three
Make believe you was indeed a copied MC
You can smell me a lil' bit, boy, my connect just mailed me a lil' bit
I got that block out of drought, now everybody love me
It's like Beetlejuice, shit gon' get ugly



I got to be out, at the club door with the key out
Bouncer at the door trynna tell me put the weed out
Honey got her feet out, the dudes coked up looking skied out
Tapped her on the shoulder like let's be out
Now should I speed it up, you know whisper in her ear, skeet skeet it up
Or should I take it to the crib and try to beat it up
A little candlelight and dinner when we need it up


Yo, another one light the dutch, it's Redman, holla bitch
Fuck you, that means she swallowed it
I do double on the turn, you must learn
Like K-are, the A-are, I grip it firm
If they brought hip hop back, sucker MC's be eating a lil' bit
Redman is on fire, so call him quick
You can reach me at 1-800 Eat-A-Dick






If you like it (a lil' bit) I will give you a (a lil' bit)
If you want it (a lil' bit) you can have some more
Now that you spent it (a lil' bit) you can taste it a (a lil' bit)

Yeah.... the coming is everything
(Just when you thought it was safe
I got to slap taste out ya muthafuckin' mouth!, bitch)
Yo! Yo!


It's the M.C. stresser, Street the aggressor
I apply pressure, until your lungs explode
Over choke flows, rap, over load
I live by the code style that's mad P.L.O
Shaolin pro, equipped with rhymes to go
Scully low, rock a teflon coat like it's ten below
Controller of my destiny, live for longevity
When my life in jeopardy, bust shots consecutively
Black teflon rap, I lay this on you heavily
Deadly Melodies, I rock the Iron Mic steadily
M.C.'s keep tryin' to step in my zone
Get ya head flown, crush your nose bone with the microphone
New York's bravest, longly awaited (come on)
Highly anticipated, street niggas favorite
I never ride dicks, that's why y'all niggas hate it
I'm Street Educated, plus thug related
Wu affiliated, still underrated
That's to be the greatest, world's most famous
Crowd entertainer, top debut gainer
Hip hop hall of famer, rap terminator


Who the slang pro nigga role, banned from your radio
Flow straight ghettio (aiyo) but y'all don't hear me though
(I rock for all my niggas) I rock for all my niggas
(I rock for all my niggas) I rock for all my niggas


This is Street radio, live in stereo flow
No video, still ghettio slang pro
Hoes by the boat load, lust for my logo
But they don't get shit from Street, but hard dick and coco'
I'm known to hold a grudge, bust slug and drug
Flood the court with thug, scream, 'fuck the judge'
Bad firm, I never learned, crack the bird, burn a dutch
Never had much, never gave a fuck, give it up
You ain't larger than life, to lose ya life
In the heat of the night, talk like you walk, you might get sniped
Just because you got a record deal, don't make you real
Just because you sold a mil, don't make you hard to kill
If you feel like I feel, we both know you bluffin'
I'm about to snuff you the fuck out for nothing, aiyo
I'm in full Street mode, ghetto episodes
Never sold my soul, or fall for fool's gold
Just control the globe with wise words told
It's been in my blood, since I was God's years old




Hey, aiyo!



Chorus:
You're all I need to get by--
(x2)

Verse One:
Shorty I'm there for you anytime you need me
For real girl
It's me in your world, believe me
Nothing make a man feel betta than a woman
Queen with a crown that be down for whatevera
There's a few things dat's forever, my lady
We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nothin
You made a brother feel like he was somethin
Dat's why I'm witchu til dis day Boo no frontin
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say "Baby it'll be okay."
Now dat's real to a brotha like me baby
Never ever give my pussy away and keep it tight aight
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a fat ass crib wit thousands of kids
Word life you don't need a ring to be my wife
Jus be there for me I'm a make sure we
Be livin in the fucking lap of luxury
I'm realizing dat cha didn't have to fuck wit me
But cha did now I'm going all out kid
And I got mad love to give, you my nigga

Chorus:

Mary J Blidge:
Like sweet morning dew
I took 1 look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny
With you I spend my time
I'll dedicate my life
I'll sacrifice to you
Dedicate my life to you

Verse Two:
I got a love jonez for your body and your skin tone
Five minutes alone I'm already on da bone
Plus I love da fact you got a mind of your own
No need to shop around you got dat good shit at home
Even if I'm locked up North you in da world
Rockin three fourths of cloth never showin' your stuff off, Boo
It be true me for you dat's how it is
I can be your knower you can be my Wiz
Then I can be your sun, you can be my Earth

Yo, Yo, I couldn't give a rat's ass
I've come to eat grub and slap ass
And show my whole entire black ass
Y'all know the saying he who laughs last laughs loudest
Bang the loudest, can't a coward do a thing 'bout it
What the bum-ba claat like "aye carumba"
Here's my name and number, lets "La Rhumba"
Doc, it makes me wonder; how many heads has Heather Hunter's
How many different conclusions to come to
And my sixteen bars meth, hittin' too hard
With a total disregard for whole entourage
Rap phenom, slap your ass, snap your thong to my theme song
And hope you don't get clap upon
Who that kid, as dirty as that Ol' Dirty Bastard
Who that kid, who pack a tool belt and dirty belt and dirty ratchet
Set your tape recorder, lock down your daughter
Soon as a touch the rap game, out of order


Do I get brollic
Gimme that car ill show you how to flip mileage
Gimme that mic, ill short it with a quick wattage
Skip college for the big wallet
The ape with a fire escape from the weight of a hit product
My draft is cold like miller beer
When you hear it, you see more stars than tigger's cheer
The red nigga here, and its out of control
Something like when Ron Gold' went out with Nicole
I'll bring it back to the streets where the crooks belong
And if it ain't come back raw, you cooked it wrong
Gangsta bomb, hold your nose
At the show, ill be shittin' out my mouth like my colon closed
Me and meth, 100 proof, in case y'all a biter
And ovaries, feel these great ball of fire
(Doc, where the lighter) I'm hemming them up
Coffee grind them and put them in a vanilla dutch

 (with America's' most after the end of each line)
Believe that, the brothers in the house now be that
Believe that, lets turn the mother out now, be that
Beback , that what it all about now ,be that
We not playin' (knowwhatinsayn' sonsayin)
Believe that, the brothers in the house now be that
Believe that, lets turn the mother out now, be that
Beback , that what it all about now ,be that
Fuck with the meth(knowwhatinsayn' sonsayin)


I'm looking at you killers like you stole something, fuck ya life
Trust my niggas, sometimes for I trust my wife
Fuck it, I'm nice, y'all don't be rushing the mic
With your guns in your left hand
Not bustin' it right
Ain't no I in the team
Ain't no eyen' my cream
I'm a semi-auto, clean
Rapid-fire machine
Cocky, six foot three with knock knees
Attract hoodrats for blocks cause I got cheese


Yo, dude I carry cheese, but I don't flaunt it
When the towel it thrown it, you know there's grown men that spoke on it
We both want it, the Trackmasters
Puncturing holes in the beat when a vocal tone poke on it
Barbaric, my caddie truck beyond average
With the same size wheels that on a horse carriage
Up in the air , spot my dudes
Rollin' over shit like B. Rhymes on mountain dew

 - repeat 2X




Eh yo, eh yo, eh yo
Yo, yo, yo
My son want his back, fuck that (my shine is beautiful)
It's time right now, you know?
It's like we ain't fuckin with no lame ass niggas no more
Bein bullshit by bullshit niggas (for real)


Am I my brother's keeper?
Theres no need to ask, I'm the creeper
Million dollar man, Johnny Cash
Puff the reefer, sometimes mix it with the hash
Hard to keep up, 100 yards dash, beat your feet up
Jumpin Jack Flash on a muthafuckas ass
Caught 'em in the weed stash tryin to tap the bag
Now he suspect, read him his rights, it's only right
I never, never, never in my long-legged life
Ever bite like shark niggas, got an appetite
For destruction, lusting for dough, it's disgusting
Disgraceful, end of disscusion, this tasteful
Like cyanide erase you, pull up, let me take two
Come all you faithful, Meth and Shyheim
Tommy Hilfiger, that I'm a Johnny 'field nigga
Till I die, S.I.N.Y. testify
Girlfriend sweating my game, killing my high


I'm a 100 proof, like Smirnoff blue label
I'm so wild, got housearrest bracelets on each ankle
I break you, something fatal and make New Jersey trade you
You don't got game, so niggas don't playa-hate you
Come back to Brooklyn, the ya G's gone
Chase you up, batted in dun, dun
Nike won't endorse you so you rock an And-1
I pull out the M-1 and hit you handsome
Cuz you forcin it, you can hang it up like an ornament
End your actin career, put you back in street tournaments
Run for your life, like you doing suicides
When even use your scrub ass, Live '9-9


Am I my brother's keeper?
There's no need to ask
I ride for my brothers, give me the gun and the mask
We be in the bushes like The Down Low stash
Pop up like a warrant, let off on that ass


Yo..
Y'all could catch the player Inf' way beyond calm
Sharp and on bomb chron, rockin my Sean John
Copin the bomb chron from Sharon on the quan
Got me chinky-eyed like a Hong Kong don
Fire arm palm, cock back caution
Alarm for the chumps, boy what you think you gon' palm with my charms
Better pay attention to the harm in my palm and it's fully-loaded
If I said it, could he hold it?
But once he seen the gun I said, "son, look he bolted"
Son, look he noted, the Berrettas'll shever, but he was clever
He stopped screwing and he blew in his vendettas
His crew was in to leathers, Avirex and guns
Some of them was smart but I could say the rest was dumb
So I played the vest for dumb and saved the checks for dumb
Cuz they hard-head niggas who graze and steadily come
To be leakin something, you could care for speakin
Frontin bout shit they stick, instead of zip they lip
They was young niggas, you know the young dumb niggas
Who don't care how they get it as it come, nigga
*fades*


*old school party music playing and fades*
Hey, hey...
Are you that little guy makin all that big noise?
*sounds of mad ass dog and man screaming*

Hard to touch retarded fucks playing with their fantasies
Respect this, specialist, black, testing this will get ya necklace jacked
And name scratched up off my guest list
Party freak, you the type of nigga that'll hardly speak unless you spoken to
You throw a cold screw, but sober up when I'm approaching you
At the same time we posting two
Niggas on that ass that's gonna do what they supposed to do
The limelight, snatched away from you because it's my night
Killarm blaze hot in the twilight, you better get ya lines right
Half of these crabs can't even rhyme right

Yo, my words should never fail
Shootin' darts sharper than a carpenters nail
Inhale life, exhale strive anxiety's trife
Blowin' smoke out my peace pipe
Ducking the snipe shot off the top of the White House
A cop pauses, war never does its many causes
My offense is my defense extreme precautions
Moving cyphers high velocities making you nauseous
Ya forcing it, terrorist extortionists, aborting this
Space ship that's spacious face it, almost can taste it

Let me know its real son if its really real
Understandable, self explainable, caution
John Blaze flammable when under pressure, interchangeable and still
Coming down like precipitation as I reign undisputed
How Johnny do it? Dangerously
Whooping cough (cough, cough), chewing off
Stank pussy make my dick sore
Bottom line be this, high explosive
Not for the average Joseph, come and get some
Hold eight and keep one, up in the chamber
Blast with my middle finger
9 swordsmen attack like the Four Horsemen
See me dog walking, strictly ghettio slang talkin'
All up in these guts, often, these rap niggas official
We slap niggas with mad charges
Dope shit regardless
We usually take another niggas garments, what?


Straight up and down I got this rap shit locked in '98
Niggas can't escape the laws that I enforce
Like top notch politicians who be politicking
Slam through and expand total construction across the planet
And micro chip software placed in the rear of ya ear
As I slid to next year
All y'all analog niggas fuck y'all we be digital, shit is critical
Like the hallways in my projects
Similar to the streets in Tibet
Fuck that, I ain't playing with a full deck son



(Intro)
Quick to pop off let a couple shots off
Leave em bleeding out with his shoes & his socks off

(Verse 1  Streetlife)
War dancing. I aint trying to make it rain though
You slow gassing. Ill leave you brain on your Durango
First classmen, old school with the Kangol
Thug passion, that pussy juice like a mango
Hulk smashing, make it jump like everlasting
God body Ramadan, 30 day fasting
Six two brown skin fellow with the Caesar fade
360 waves, side burns with a little graze
I remain relevant; Im a raw element
High street intelligent. Product of my tenement
Son of Anarchy, smoking that Bob Marley
La la la be killing these niggas slowly
Wake up, smell the coffee, sleep on the street is costly
Pay attention to the warning signs, dont cross me
Give em hypertention. That niggas is getting salty
Im quick to pop off back the fuck up off me

(Chorus - Carlton Fisk)
Carlton Fisk banana clip silver back gorilla
Mr. Streetlife show you what that heat like

(Chorus - Hanz On)
Hanz on yo we handle them Berettas PLO
Yo its forever, bout to show em what it bes like

(Chorus - Method Man)
Method man, turn a dollar to a million
Killa bees we in the building
Making sure the children eat right eat right
In the building make sure the babies eat right

(Chorus - Hanz On)
In the building make sure the babies eat right

(Verse 2 - Carlton Fisk)
Black scenery white chalk yellow tape
Carlo got a bullet proof wallet, bitch in every state
Light that smoke that animals ferocious
Dealing with the boss mentality really focus
Tailor made linen & loafers, louie emblems
Problems on the street my lieutenant quickly attending them
Carlito ways, brown bag money
In the book of life you cant get stuck to one page
All in together now, chinchilla bullet proof
Hoodies for any sign of winter war weather
And daddy gonna get that cash so clever
And Meth push the button my hands all on the trigger
And they thought I rot in jail, like go figure
If I laid down dead in the street you going too nigga
And this is raw kicking out your door start to scream out loud
Carlton Fisk back for more

(Chorus - Carlton Fisk)
Carlton Fisk banana clip silver back gorilla

Killa bees we in the building
Making sure the children eat right eat right

(Chorus - Hanz On)
In the building make sure the babies eat right

(Verse 3 - Method Man)
Now whoever read me wrong, can start by reading my palm
Make me catch a flashback of my father beating my mom
Kiss the ring, (hashtag) aint easy being a don
So I gotta carry the heat, ain't easy being LeBron
This is past rap, but I aint pass the baton
Tell them rappers bypass it or get to passing it on
I wont take it passed that, even if I pass it Im gone
Better yet, scratch that, yall dont get a pass then its on
We Hanz On, everybody watchin the Don
Got their eyes on the kid when they should be watchin their own
Telling lies on the kid, they said hes not in a zone
Said he never reach the top, but that aint stop him from going
They already on, so hungry his ribs are showin
The money is getting low, the bum niggas is on
55 Bowen
These hungry adolescents is grown
When they get the Smith & Wesson they adolescence is gone

(Chorus - Carlton Fisk)
Carlton Fisk banana clip silver back gorilla
Mr. Streetlife show you what that heat like

(Chorus - Hanz On)
Hanz on yo we handle them Berettas PLO
Yo its forever, bout to show em what it bes like

(Chorus - Method Man)
Method man, turn a dollar to a million
Killa bees we in the building
Making sure the children eat right eat right

(Chorus - Hanz On)

Anticipation of what's to come
I'm so happy that I'm the lucky one
So long I've waited but it's never too late for love
It feels so right, baby that it can't be wrong
Where I am weak baby you make me strong
I'm down for you and whatever you want to do
It's all up to you because


Anything for you I am gonna try to
I'm bonafide, body's just for you
Pleasure every way you can ride
Just to get with you
If you choose to


Whatever method used is alright with me
As long as you get to where you need to be
This is the vision made for both of our eyes to see
It feels so right, it can't be wrong
Where I am weak baby you make me strong
I'm down for you and whatever you want to do
It's all up to you because




Dirty Bas, style cuts like glass
Gotta gotta keep it high power to the mass
Yo Taj, another-like platinum hit
Party people all around be sayin that's the shit


Kaboom, guess who stepped in the room
Tical, hailing from the Shaolin Isle
It be me the killer bee, on the M-I-C
With the S-S-double-double-U to the V-V
Me me going downtown, let me see
If we all and together now, make it mo' better now
Listen I ain't sweating no competition
Flow, going mad low like I'm dissing


Another chapter from the Wu-Tang group
Take a look or a peak, killer bees never sleep
Nonstop put you on the chopping block
Unorthodox, attitude to melting pot


I'll do anything, I'm so into you
Right here, I'm Weak, downtown with the Wu
Kaboom, guess who stepped in the room
The S-S-double-double-U to the V-V


Anything you want me to do I'll do it
Oh, anything that you want me to do, to do
Anything you want me to do I'll do it
Oh, anything that you want me to do, to do

(come on in)

Dinn-dnn-dnn-ta-dnn

Dinn-dnn-ta-dnn, dinn DNN DAH
(come on, come on, come on in)
Dnn-da-duh-duh-DAH, you BITCH ASS niggas!
(come on in, come on, come on, come on in)


As high as Wu-Tang get
Allah allow us pop this shit
Just like black shoe fit
If you can't wear it, well don't fuck with it!


Yo, too many songs, weak rhymes that's mad long
Make it brief Son, half short and twice strong
No doubt, it took time searchin, eventually
It was prime urgent, for you to examine the rhyme merchant
Lace MC's with styles when they rhyme drunk
On a label hunt, until twenty thou, out the trunk
Eight Diagram sword swinga armored tank force
RZA throw in the disc but then change the bank source
You can't flow, must be the speech impediment
You got lost off the snare off Impeach the President
Whether in Amsterdam smokin seven grams of green
Then you pack, a thousand white teens in tight jeans
This Witty Unpredictable shot is critical
To analytical analogy, insurance policies why
Said he know that sounds define the note
Couldn't recognize, blast him the fuck behind the ropes
Too many dope niggas I see starvin
Catch a single deal, a possible plea bargain
Wu slay regardles to whom or what, five mics five nights
Hang him from the balcony, drop twenty-five flights
A fugitive bass playin rap czar
Smoke the cigars, his prints on the strings of his guitar


As high as Wu-Tang get
Allah allow us pop this shit
Just like black shoe fit
If you can't wear it, well don't fuck with it!


Tical got a hold on ya, doin exactly
What the fuck I mariju-wanta, dis nigga nasty
Deep in the dirty dungeon, buggin, lovin
The ways these rhymes keep comin, at cha splash ya
Get your head piece fractured, with killer cuts
From the Shropshire Slasher, rip shit up
Got this whole thing Tang mastered, sho nuff
An MC too good to be touched, John John
Bring the phenomenon, I cold crush
MC, inferiorities they froze up, ice cold
As we move on, saga unfold
Captivated by a saga that go untold, like Goldfinger
Caught up in a cliffhanger
Yo I-N-S another code red, danger, break out the vest
Now it's tactical warfare, it's all here
Come with your shield and hardware, it be on here
Don't ever roam, in the naked city
Eight million stories none pretty
Bomb em wit the Witty Unpredictable
Conditionin' be critical
Peace to Tang, gettin high on your physical, dis next drink
Is a toast to your memory
When I go how many niggas gon' remember me


As high as Wu-Tang get
Allah allow us pop this shit
Just like black shoe fit
If you can't wear it, well don't fuck with it!




Do you want to get high man?


Does Pinocchio have wooden balls man?


Well yo, I got a joint I've been saving here for a special occasion


Ah, niggas, bitches, welcome
A full tank of gas, a pound of weed, a bird called Pinky

The RZA, the GZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Inspectah Deck
Raekwon the Chef, U-God, Ghostface Killah, Masta Killa
And the Me --- yeah, yeah, come on, now, now


What's happening? Who get it cracking like a neck snapping
For the rapping, and who them fellas packing yelling Staten
From the background, I'll back down a few
Try to clown us in the past, where they at now?
I'm ill as baby powder with the smackdown, for the record
My brain is like the project projected, for the Method
Go see my nigga Kush, he got the best shit for burning
This one go out for whom it may concerning
Spending they entire earning, trynna get a higher learning
MC's is vermin, like E be Sermon
Ya'll too determined, feeling yaself like Pee-Wee Herman
While we at it, let's tighten up our grips around that cabbage
Silly rabbits, how many kids'll trick you out your carrots
Ghetto bastards and ghetto bitches, I break you like a bad habit
My dick is two inches too big for it's britches
Uh, so fuck a mister and your misses
Cottonmouth niggas X'ed out like Merry Christmas, that all
Uh-huh, be home

*bell rings*


Knock, knock, who is it, Tical I pop digit
My block too hot to visit, round here, you gots to live it
MC's, you must admit it, I'm deadly on this mic like
Anthrax on this premise, anyone of ya'll can get in
I breathe, Backwoods sleeves and THC
I bleed, kamikazes and forty OZ's
America's Most, the better the smoke, the better the quotes
For cheddar, Meth'll sever the throat, whatever the coast
I'm home, let the sun shine on, get his grind on
And get some phone time, everytime I'm in your timezone
Look here, it's crooked letter I, ya'll don't meet nothing but crooks here
It's hot in hell's kitchen, get your cookware, for goodness
MC's is like that shit chicks be gushing
For pushing, got me tooken down to Central Booking
I stick out, as if Tical just walked up in the party with my dick out
And I'm prepared to take the shit I dish out

"When you realize that what you got ain't what you want" - sample


On the, yo, on the expressway, suddenly, I, um, hit the breaks
A mistake, patrol figure just, ran the plates
I pull to the shoulder, a half mile ahead
The vibe got colder when the marksman said
"Yo, you in the truck, get the fuck out your car
Put your hands where my eyes could see, not far"
A fat slob, with pepperspray in the canister
Donut shop lounger, nine mil brandisher
Plus my half pound just rang the bell
Of the bloodhound, had an acute sense of smell
I guess he was tired of the strip and booking whores
Moving off a tip he's claimed he's looking for
Some MC's wanted for a string of break-ins
Last seen wearing long minks and snakeskins



Check it out, yo


I be like yiggy, yes y'all
Doctor on call
I'll rock 'til my name in graffiti on the wall
Got flow like the rapids in Great George
Got weed? (I got blunts) My name Jamal
I pause, flick the ash from my L
I Pause like Run and Jason Mizell
The emcee is me, host for the night
Papa Doc, only thing I don't choke on the mic
I choke a bitch out if my gwap ain't correct
Then with my John Hancock, I'll get the check
I love trucks but drop tops is the best
From the Beemers, Benz, now I roll Lex, watch me
Ha ha, she like Red so cool
Any nigga after me, is a deja vu
Doc stay in the paint like A.I. shoes
Just watch how a one tonner made a move, dig it


Hop in my truck and roll up the window
Ayo, you know what you in for
Once we turn the corner, light up the indo
Ayo, ayo, ayo

Oh yes, she's with me gettin' low like a limbo
Roll with Gs and we'll show you how to get dough
Third degree, let it burn with my kinfolk
Ayo, ayo, ayo


Who these corner store rappers slingin' cracks in my hall?
Mama's in the kitchen cookin' cat, rat and dog
Me, I want a lil' somethin', y'all could have it all
I tryna walk before I crawl and move this package in my draws
That's why I push the pedal to the muh'fuckin' floor
With ten per cent left to those who bloodsuck the poor
And still I keep it funky like four plus one more
Get this money like 'In God We Trust', trust your boy
It's a given, livin' this life like it was written
Especially for me, I'm what the recipe is missing
Blow my piff in the air, key the ignition
Then get to lane switchin', pluckin' ashes off the clip and
Mammy wanna ride and play the Bonnie to my Clyde
If anybody try to 'Kill Bill', it'll probably be the bride
Like all jokes aside, I'm serious with mine
And now I'm on this grind like Method Man in his prime




Yo, I got my swagger on and I feel great
Funk Doc be in the hood like Enfamil cases
I network on MySpace real late
Hoping my app'll make me another Bill Gates
Around my crib, look how I live
I'm a slob but crip niggas say I get biz
Anywhere I did a show women sayin' that I'm
So amazing


Yeah, another mic, another night in the Days Inn
Another heist, another kite in the state pen
My state business shit, y'all dudes just break wind
(New York nigga) Either you're made mice or made men
I do the dirt that keep my hand on the work
I got the other hand up Mona Lisa's skirt
My aim one since day one, Doc
How many shots will it take to make son drop?





Check it out, yo
I be like "yiggy yes y'all", Doctor on call
I'll rock 'til my name in graffiti on the wall
Got flow like the rappers in Great George
Got weed? (I got blunt) My name Jamal
I pause, flick the ash from my L
I (Pause) like Run and Jason Mizell
The emcee is me, host for the night
Papa Doc, only thing I don't choke on the mic
I choke a bitch out if my gwap ain't correct
Then with my giant hancock, I'll get the cheque
I love trucks but drop-tops is the best
From the Beemers, Benz, now Rolex - watch me
Haha, she like "Red so cool"
Any nigga after me, it's a deja vu
Doc stay in the paint like A.I. shoes
Just watch how a one tonner made a move, dig it!


Hop in my truck and roll up the window
A-yo, you know what you in for
Once we turn the corner, light up the endo
A-yo, a-yo, a-yo
Yes she with me getting low like a limbo
Roll with Gs and we'll show you how to get dough
Third degree, let it burn with my kinfolk
A-yo, a-yo, a-yo

Who these corner store rappers slinging cracks in my hall?
Mama's in the kitchen cooking cat, rat and dog
Me, I want a little something, y'all could have it all
I tryna walk before I crawl and move this package in my draws
That's why I push the pedal to the muh'fuckin floor
With ten per cent method, only plug something poor
And still I keep it funky like four plus one more
Get this money like "In God We Trust", trust your boy
It's a given, living this life it was written
Especially for me, I'm what the recipe is missing
Blow my piff in the air, key the ignition

Around my crib, look how I live

Anywhere I did a show women saying that I'm
"So aaaaaa-ma-zing"

Yeah, another mic, another night and the day's end
Another heist, another kite in the state pen
My state business shit, y'all dudes just break wind
New York nigga, either you're made mice or made men
I do the dirt that keep my hand on the work
I got the other hand up Mona Lisa's skirt
My A-1 since day one stop
How many shots will it take to make son drop?

"It's true - the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang, could be dangerous!"


Uh-huh, Mr. Biggs, Trackmasters (woo!)
It's a Wu-Tang official right here y'know


Yeah, the employees of the year yeah we're back to work
We took time off, while other rappers got jerked
Shit's bout to change now, it's a shame how
Things ain't the same but I'm back in the game now
And as we step in the door, we cause panic
Yep, the usual suspects, we at it
Vet status, y'all went a week with the belt
Few chicks felt your style, now you feelin yourself
Meet your maker, I dropped you at eight years old
I got stock in your flow and crops to sharehold
Crops with the prose where cops won't dare go
Got top centerfolds too hot to wear clothes
Still me - always have and will be
Ill G - it's silly to hate but feel free
Hey - hear what I say, they gotta pay
And my return is like Christ, declare the holiday


Back in the game now.. copped me some weed now
My people bout to eat now.. shit's bout to change now
Back in the game now.. all my niggas in the hood now
Better catch up now.. shit's bout to change now


Uh, y'all see I'm in the street strugglin
Young dumb and thuggin, give a FUCK about nuttin
Stuck at rock bottom, tryin to come up on somethin
Pumpin from sundown to sun-up, we hustlin
Vision my nigga now get in where you fit in
And see prison, as just the high cost of livin the life
Ante up cause if you blow the dice
On that O-Z, Dorothy ain't goin home tonight
That's on e'rythang, put it on the kids and the wife
Been buryin my folks ever since they raised the price on the coke
Searchin for a quick antidote
Mo' money, mo' problems to cope


We were at the same table when the chips were checked
A gamblin +Rebel+ who +Inspects+ the +Deck+
Just when you thought we would fold our hand
Against all odds we raised the bet like we changed the plans
It was live on air but in between station breaks
I was holdin a pair and just made the table stakes
Split the demos, put insurance on tapes
A safeguard against the crusaders in capes
If I double down they say the Gods are sharks
If we win against the house they thought the cards was marked
We draw hit after hit from a royal flush menu
While the dealer promoted the full house venue
A spade in the club with the heart to wear diamonds
The high roller who got credit upon signin
They look puzzled when I shuffle, most of 'em stunned by the hustle
Recourse of bluff game's your muscle

 - 0.75X
 Say what? ("Shaolin shadowboxing!")
 Shit's bout to change..


Aiyyo, on rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich, coolin with a mean ill Jamaican bitch
Banana coat matchin with the ratchet
Lil' black weave sweatpants style, air force is actin
Jump in the 6, kicks look crisp, talkin bout the bird
Flow through your hood in the mean tints that's giant
It's like the family that flipped on you for lyin
Buried you alive, left your whore cryin
We on your floor look more doors
Dey ain't ate either, I hope y'all niggas is armed
And when we get there, all my niggas in the mix
Yeah Shallah Lex, Diamond got me buyin Louis Rich wear


Most people say the Clan was missin since I got dropped offa radio
Overnight your whole style was bitten in the process
Everybody switched they names like
Whatcha call it, any fast (?)
It was the Gods that repped that, sharkskin dark skinned bitches
Clarks from Digi left the game dizzy
Ooh got busy, that dancey shit slid through
We had to stay hood cause that's who we been through
RZA came through, mastermind got the cash and power
Proof that power plastered divine classical lines
Mathematical rhymes, the style is unbearable
Now niggas with the radical shines
It's Ghost-Deini, every coast need me
We back motherfucker that's right, it's the W.T.C
World Trade Center, Wu-Tang Clan
We brought so much heat that we was givin you tans an' shit



{*Ron Isley ad libs to fade*}

Top fie, hands down, Staten popular son, peace lounge
Crown fitted for the king, I am, I suggest, you play the wing man

Lifestyle episodes of Gangland. Thirty six shots from the chamber blam...

Give me the cue


Skip the introduction proceed to lip function
The junction get rushed by some grimy people busting weed
Splatter your melon like some Attica felons
Use a firearm good, Bloods go for heart swelling
Insert the spasm, yes the dirty herb has him
Thoroughbred thugs insert the fantasm
Verbal smarts, spark the word, visit my scripture
Exotic wine, holding nine Picasso pictures
When the rhyme pivot you now, limit your chance
Bodyguard the lyric with unlimited stance
Words seem to zing on down to Beijing
When we touch down, would you crown renowned kings


There's no honor amongst thieves
Street pharmaceutical stack like Genovese
The Four Devils tempt madmen but not these
We profound hardcore sound to MCs, thumbs down, prepare
Killa bees it be warfare, this the year
Niggas gotta take you off of here, hold the square
If we go there we go gritty and spread fear
Through this rap city, call the mayor
My razor sharp darts be like cold stares
The smell of fear make my nostrils flair, truth or dare?
Ask yourself can you compare to these niggas in the hood
Johnny B. Goode or he be gone yeah
The struggle goes on, you've been warned
PLO from here to Lebanon, how many bomb
Must we drop in the Ninety-Now?
Walk a mile in my shoes, get the street news from Meth-Tical


Glocks'll be spitting, you gots to be kidding
Aiyo kid you gots to be kidding
Or Glocks'll be spitting
You gots to be kidding yo


It's common sense how I master my circumference, you dense
I get locked the fuck up, released on my own recognizance
Can't be judged, young bloods bust back like scuds
Wu-Tang hovers one thousand notches above
MC level, yo, I stay highs like treble
Foes who oppose get plucked like rose petals
Arresting and holding, penetrate forbidden regions
Wack MCs only lasting one season
The morale was low at the corral
Adjective pronouns had no style, your weak proposal
Aim for the official, initial is Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah
All that other bullshit ain't permissible
Annual increase of the Wu-Tang Manual
Handles to keep all this Hip Hop shit tangible
Illegible, every egg ain't edible
My tracks remain 'Unforgettable' like Ol' Nat Cole
Got to catch this paper to buy Shaquasia a glacier
Nebuchadnezzar skyscraper
Understanding the continents of Africa and Asia
And free the Black Man from enslaved labor, Wu-Tang


The weight of the fam is on our back and we can't fall
Victim to this long hall of fame, meaning nothing
We came to punish the glutton with a substance
That can't be contained, Wu-Tang


Motherfuckers
We be seeing y'all asses when we walk up in the club
Y'all all in the back
Scared to speak, we speak cause you scared
Punk motherfucker, we know what time it is


All you been seeing is upsets in the boxing shit, right
It's like come on man
This nigga fucked up motherfucking Whitaker
Dang, he caught Whitaker
He caught Whitaker a long time ago
Mike got touched
Then Mike got touched by Holyfield
Hey Mike's, Mike's gonna forfeit this fight
He ain't fighting McDermit
He ain't fighting
Nope
Whattup
You talking bout he, what he, what he, what he did
Told them he cut his eye, in sparring


Stella D'oro wrap breadsticks, David Berkowitz
Einstein birthed a hit, now nurture it
M.G.M. front row seat tonight, no gems
Purify, cleanse, ran into some beef up in the men's
Fix your sawed off, Wu-Tang tore me off the cross
All you saw was white meat, skin hanging off
These is words from the Arch Bishop, some call it six up
The Betty Crocker Marvel cake, snakes will miss a
Wax janitor, black Jack Mulligan from Canada
Slam dance, tarantula style, you's a fan of the
Monopoly king, Slavic poetry
Carnegie Hall's off the hook, let's push through the armory
Mack truck hitting soloist, Soul Controllers
Behold of the thousand teeth fist, swift and boneless


You know cause Wu-Tang is invincible, you know what I mean
It's Wu-Tang Forever God
We gonna get down with that W
You gonna get down with that W
That's that Wu, that's that Wisdom
That's the Wisdom of the Universe
That's the truth, of Allah, for the Nation of the Gods
YouknowhatI'msayin
We breaking egg through these days God
YouknowhatI'msayin
We got the fucking way
We got the medicine for your sickness
Out here, ya knowhatImean

Yo Shorty, you don't even gotta go to summer school
Pick up the Wu-Tang double CD
And you'll get all the education you need this year
YouknowhatImean

Word man it's Wu-Tang Forever God
Niggas can't fuck with these lyrics God
YouknowhatI'msayin
Knamean
Oh hell no, none of this shit
C'mon man -- beats, lyrics man, y'all niggas
Niggas can't even understand half this shit
I think niggas ain't gonna figure it out til the year Two-G
(Wax niggas ass for free or fee) Word
Yo, you know what
The next Wu-Tang album ain't even coming out until 2000
YaknowhatImean
That's just gonna come back with a comet
You hear, we gonna bring a comet
Check for that shit in the millenium
YouknowhatImean? So, yo, y'all niggas man
Be the resurrection
The Gods is here man
Born Gods is here

Whack shit, turn my back on it like a friend that stole
Been in the game ten years, I got ten to go
It's the prince and the dark knight let's begin day-O
Call me mister low maintenance
Tell them ho's I'm like a doctor that lost his license
I got no patients, I got time for wasting
If you ain't fam you ain't relating
These hating hot dog rappers is baking
Without love, like a stoner without bud
Your ass is as flat as a soda without suds
Who got the nerve to think that Meth can't rhyme
Put a nine to your skull and get that out your mind, mind
Yes! Uh oh! Like Lumi Dee
If Meth ain't that shit by now I'm soon to be
When I choke hold mics I don't give'em room to breathe
I'm just doing me, but girl if you're fine I'll do you free
By now if you don't know who it be, don't make me tell
Just know I killer Mike like that kid from ATL
If you fail to plan, baby plan to fail
See my game ugly ... like Sam Cassel
I'm so funky I can't even stand the smell
Come on, life's a drag, roll it up and inhale
Don't get comfy, I cramp your style like a monthly
Even Demi Moore need more than Ashton Kutcher to punk me
My 4-5 bars, just one shot'll clear the block
Like it's time for 106 & Park
Staten Island dropping your ass, we mean business
My gun'll put a shot in your ass
Like free clinics

Guess what? Normally you wouldn't find me
Under the crowd of lights, in search of a love in life
But you shakin' that stuff right
I think I should make you my wife




You probably think I'm tryin' crush tonight
Cuz I got a look of lust, like crust in my eye
No matter what I say, keep it tight
Keep it away from me like Superman and kryptonite
You see I'm not thinkin' short term, I've learned
Givin' everybody turns, can I like a back burn
Oh, you got this lover wanna beg to earn, oh baby




I know it sounds boo, I ain't even known you two
Days and I'm open to, the point that I propose to you
Must think I'm some kind of fool, don't you
You can call it what you're thinkin'
But I'm thinkin' we gon' jump that broom


Back-seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Her neck and wrist all froze, I'm trynna catch a cold
Clippin' the trey, we sippin' away
On that 'Ze, innovations, slowin' slippin' away
Ain't life funny, don't nothin' move but that money
Oh boy, honeys, lookin' like Playboy bunnies
They whole swagger, that be the type that I go after
That get more attention cuz they ass is more fatter
And every day gotta have a, but I ain't trynna make her unconfy
Or cramp her style like a monthly
How many women want a man, with big plans
Big feet and big hands, ya'll understand
Why big daddy wear the big pants, I'm big boned
And if this symbolizes my life, I live long
My funny valentine, won't you be mine
Fifty grand on the wedding band, let it G-Wine






What? What you want?
Represent represent represent
Yeah, represent, check it out check it out


Yo mama don't wear no drawers!
I saw her when she took them off!
Standing on the welfare line
Eating swine trying to look fine, with her stank behind
You can ask the bitch and she'll tell ya fast
Meth-Tical got STYLE with his nasty ass


Are you ready, to face the consequences and suffer?
I even tell ya momma you ain't shit, motherfucker
Bring it, and let that killer bee kid sting it
And rep-resent, it's like heads up a brick, when I swing it
Get lost, I break you off something
I'm pumping, like a Reebok, with a pump
From the jump and, you was nothing
Bet you thought you fucking clan had ya back but they was fronting
Smoking dirt blunts and fucking nasty sluts and
You just a naked gun without the bullet, what you busting
Get your ship sunken, fucking with a drunken
Master disaster at any rap functions


Just an echo, yoo-hoo
We be living in the valley yoo-hoo
It may be difficult to bring back
Sweet memories of you
And you can even ask your crew
Bet your bottom dollar that they tell ya fast
Meth-Tical got STYLE with his nasty ass


Who said the Wu-Tang Clan? Was it you or your man?
You wanna point the finger, I'll bring ya
36 chambers, be out, you'se in danger
Let me pull your brain out your ass with a hanger
Didn't momma tell ya not to talk to a stranger?
Now ya got ya neck, in the noose, of the strangler
Just recline, keep the Meth in mind
I'll even test the knuckle check on the hands of time
What? And I'll be more than glad to bust that ass
All up and down the block, the street, that ave
Whatever, smoking on a Spike Lee joint
Hey I'm Mo' Better, I'm hoping niggas get the point
Cause they could never, stop the veteran, word to God
When I'm severing the head of a mental vegetarian
The Method, at the weed gate, with a long line of credit
If you desire fire, I be the first to set it
Off, flame on like the Human Torch
Fantastic Four for all the fans in the store
You can eat it all and it'll tell you fast
Meth-Tical got STYLE for your nasty ass


94 baby, word up, recognize, recognize
Wu-Tang killer bee
The RZA and the Method MZA
Raider Ruckus, where you at?




Yo yo yo yo.. it's Funk Doc Where da weed at, bitch?

Believe that shit - slaughter, straight to camcorder

My windpipe's attached to project boilers
You yell: "Turn the heat down!"
My voice, DVD 'round sound, so I'm heard round town
And chances of y'all leavin? 'round now!
Wait later, will make front page paper
Date raper; with juvenile eighth graders
Hit the high school and 187 Caesar
When I bust y'all need to back fo' acres
Doc y'all, and that's my man Jabberjaw
The shitlist ready, who next to scratch off?
I'm from the underground, my sound lift
Platform shoes to bitches, fo'-hundred pounds!

You know tha saga, marijuana blunts and Goldschlager
With deadly medley, y'all ain't ready for Shakwon and Reggie
Don't even bother, the radio for back-up - alright then
Your man got slapped up, extorted for his ice an'
Street life is triflin "Body over here!!"
Don't make me pull a Tyson and bite a nigga ear
Precise an', slicin jugulars, the cut-throat
Ruggeder, predator, Viking, et cetera

I'm behind the brick wall with arsenic jaws
Spit poison, got a gun permit draw
Gun down at sundown - you keep score!
This trainin course and y'all ain't fit
On my crew tombstone put, "We all ain't shit!"


Yo, all you gonnabe, wannabe, when will you learn?
Wanna be Doc and Meth? Gotta wait your turn
I spit a .41 revolver on New Year's Eve
With the mic in my hand I mutilate MC's
The most slept on since Rip Van Wink'
My shit stink with every element from A to zinc
So what you think?
I'mma blackout on just one drink? You must be crazy!
A little off the wall maybe - go get a shrink!

Keep that heat and the John Lennon
Boy you won't catch me arguin'
Brick City, that's right! Hood down, hands up!
Red "Lord of the Ring," clean, lookin' for that Precious

Shit I'd rather get caught with my gun then get caught without it
It's Gilla House nigga, you know we here to smoke
DJ keep it Kool, Reggie let me UH-HAH clear my throat
When I'm in yo' town man', you better act a fool
Turn your college dorm to Rodney Dangerfield- Back to School!




'Round here we blow treez (blow treez)
'Til our nose bleed
Started with a quarter then slowly smoked up a O-Z
Ready keep it raw like a nigga ordered a whole ki'
"Nigga let me hit ya blunt" Nah, you don't know me
Gilla! Gilla House and Gotti click
Bang like karate flicks
Duck when the shotty spit
Or land in a pile of shit
Known to make you cowards bleed
Smokin' on that Sour Dies'
That cali weed's
So funky we call it cottage cheese
I'm in the powered V-12
Look at all these females

Occasional boozer

Fuck everybody that knew ya

Yes sir, yes sir


Yo, when you see smoke in the air
Two hot boys that put coke in your ear
Fuck pimp, I wanna get dope of the year

Boost my career, and bare arms heavy

Yeah, I'm a wise ass, take one to know one
Asshole Academy, yeah I'm the spokesman
Talk that greasy, on the north TV
Even pigs love the Boss Hog CD
What you find hard, I do it easy
I can see why the next guy wanna be me
Yeah, I'm a problem, ya'll can't solve 'em
Straight up bitch like Cartman mama
Keep a 'brown fox' like the 'ill na na'
B.O. 2, bitch, we bring the drama

How the fuck ya'll feeling tonight? For real


Yup, I think my mind playing tricks on me
I hold the weight like my name set the smith on me
It's Meth & Doc, nigga, back on that, homey
Back on the strip, how many women wanna strip for me?
This nigga spit, don't he? My flow is heavy
As Katrina when she broke the levy's, real as they get, whoadie
Ya'll better get to know me, I'm top notch
Got a thing for the top spot, too hot for you to hold me
When niggas ugly you gotta cut me a dime
Little Asian honey is funny, she love me long time
Get this money, if you don't mind, got money on my mind
Cuz I'm hungry, never dummy, the sun forever shine, nigga
If you rolling with us, then throw your hands up
We need Bricks and Staten Island to stand up
Here's your chance, my niggas, go 'head and man up
Blunt Brothers, see we at a level they can't touch

Wu Tang will survive, no no no-no no no
Wu Tang will survive
Cause every time they flip a party
You know the party screams and shouts
Cause you... DAMN! Aw, TC that was the bomb...


Get all my peoples, get all my peoples headphones

Aaaah, yo, show it off, kid, show em, what, what
Let em have it, bust it, hey yo, hey yo


Blend wine, who want to win mine
Shorty get a ten-round for floatin
With the richest, huh
Flexed out, Flinstone style
Your crimi-nal pen pal kidnapped Loud, jetted the
Mosyin, posin for them niggas up in Poland
Rollin wax style museum, G 'em
Them richest niggas bless this
Like Russian cut VVS's
Slide the hatchback, black were finessing this
Them niggas over there know, Gazelle goggles
And them Lottos, 88 style, throwin' bottles (bottles)
Scenario rap, rap imperial, material (uh, yo yo, yo, yo)
Murderin' cats is like that real


Yo come do me somethin word to Michelob peep the Land Rov'
Sleeper hold club faggots lay your dome on a stove
It's like space kid, the whole world is pitch black, granola rap
Dough got smaller famous team, walked up in Fotomat
Black down, numerous rounds, boots is brown
Getaway driver, this white bitch from out of town
We love horse races shakin Jakes and high-speed chases
Porno stations, drinkin violations, godly nations
90 minute Maxell tapes, instrumental breaks
Bangin earaches, lay my verse down in two takes
The speaker pops, the Winchester rifle's in the kitchen
Murder the DJ's eyes twitchin, woofer hissin


Yo, he's strong armin, manipulatin niggas, scrapin niggas
Takin play from niggas, hate fakin niggas, yo you hear me?
The whole shit's like wrestling
What you dare me? Back the fuck up kid, we flexin


This rap shit bust yo' gums, and leave you stunned
Pull your plug, now you can't function
There's no to-tal or sum to this equa-tion, you fro-zen
Many may come but few are cho-sen
Pretty niggas want to play the war po-sin
When the ruckus come, they be the first to get their shine stolen
Do or die, it be I, Meta-physical Man
Holding court from my Wu, indivisible clan
I see your thoughts and your hand reachin
It's getting deep in this mud
Cats heat seekin, for one blood
Nameless thugs been aiming slugs, shootin at these stank bitches
Less he gon' bring this above, I make switches
From the lamp I grant three wishes
Johnny be parlayin, I Blaze britches, then I roll
One hundred percent mind, one hundred percent body
One hundred percent soul, individual
Assholes tend to run
From this PLO extortion to the one
The next chamber, you fuckin with the star spangler
To the dawn's early light with this head-banger
Boogie, represent this shit fully
Like I'm constantly at war with the town bully
Who want that pressure, about to get smacked silly
Like a fat bitch in Spandex, free Willy!
We on some milli, check the joint, engine number nine
Niggas wastin time worryin about me and mine
Get your own shit

Brothers want to hang with the Meth, bring the rope
The only way you'll hang is by the neck, Nigga Bolt
Off the set, comin' to your projects
Take it as a threat, better yet it's a promise
Comin' from a vet on some old Vietnam shit
Nigga, you can bet your bottom dollar, hey, I bomb shit
And it's gonna get, even worse, word to God
It's the Wu, comin' through stickin' niggas for they garments
Movin' on your left, southpaw, Mr. Meth
Came to represent and carve my name in your chest
You can come test, realize you're no contest
Son, I'm the gun that won that old Wild West
Quick on the draw with my hands on the four-
Nine-three-eleven with the rugged rhymes galore
Check it, 'cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin' 90 proof
Huh, vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me, ayy, give it to me raw
I've learned when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need no chemical blow to pull a ho
All I need is Chemical Bank to pay da mo'


What, basically that, Meth-Tical, '94 style (*crash*)
Word up, we be hazardous
Northern spicy brown mustard hoes
We have to stick you (*horn*)


Is it real, son, is it really real, son? (motherfucker)
Let me know it's real, son, if it's really real
Something I could feel, son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal, son, if it's really real


I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin' cut your kneecaps off
And make you kneel at some staircase, piss
I'll fuckin' cut your eyelids off
And feed you nuthin' but sleepin' pills (*laugh*)
Get yours, motherfucker
SoSo fuck the ho, fuck the ho
Look at this nigga, this motherfucker, shit




Supreme Clientele

Who on this? The Fenon, them niggas can't live
Who on this? We ain't got shit, Summin Gotz ta Give
Y'll done flipped y'all wig, blacked out the kid
Die and live for my nigs and my bad ass kids
Freeze , lookin at your ice like please
Plottin on the mouse trap, about to snatch the cheese
I heard y'all kids is 'bout that, psycho therapy
Fuckin, where the cow chat? Blue till they bury me
Never tell a lie, like George with the cherry tree
Now it's cherry pie, if it's not broke, let it be
Ain't nuttin nice in, New York, stick ya for ya cake and ya icin
All that tough talk don't mean nuttin when ya up north
So keep them hands where I can see them like ya want freedom
You know that sayin, if ya can't join 'em
Beat 'em and push ya way in
We ain't acrobats but we flip on occasion
Pick the Pace up, past snaggin, throw your waist up
Niggas writin slum juice with Jacob, fool
You're like dude, I don't like your fuckin attitude
Frontin on my Clan from Shao', we ain't mad at you


Yo, Starks dippin cheesy face, meesly pace
Ghostface, jump out the window for a little taste
Droopy luck, my main bitches call me lazy
Educated birds say, "Ghost, you're so crazy"


Cappa slide thru with the Ghost
Post up like paint on walls
Drip jew-els, big heat ruffle inside the bubble-goose
It's the odd couple, holo-points follow you home in Staten Island
Playin with the big toys that make noise
Echo in the hall, a scared voice
Niggas start to act choice, but Dunkin 'hinds
Didn't know Betty Crocker had them two nines
Made the club moist, shattered the windows
Dust heads runnin, the black kingpin buzz the Black Jesus


Yo, the words you talk better be the words you walk
Body you in the van while the nurse is off
Put your vein out, watch me insert the dart
Till it bleeds from Bricks to the Persian Gulf
Light curcuits off, thirty-third if my brain is off
That explains why my language off
My gun aim and cough, y'all ain't trained to brawl
Y'all more like them training bras
Wet behind the ear, you're not prepared
For the project flow, with extra stares
I pass out a vest to wear (bullets'll fly)
Yo, a hard wire, startin bonfires
Pullin mask, so you know it's me
Your weave got more seeds than odb
Can't smoke wit'cha, watch Ghost tie rope to ya
Def and Wu will open ya


Your shit lice
Baby shake your shit 'fore your shit lice
Get rich like...


Word, it's me y'all

We in two sixes, flirtin with bitches
Dime plush, takin pictures
"How you doin baby, my name's Ghost
Don't get caught up in my chains or the way that I speak"
Seek intelligence, slickest nigga doin it since Grease
Check out the greys on the side of my waves, my crew doze on Riker's Island
Stretched out, malled up in the cage
Pull a? Out on Jimmy Jam, shakes Space Jam
Silky texture, Jordan jumped up like Clyde Drexler
All up in the parrot, nose numb, real as they come
Biggie's Versacis, Snow White rabbit
Hands is like photographic magic
Funeral love, boohoo when we hug, don't make it a habit
Hit the gym in two weeks, my back all chisseled
Elbows unique now, meet the new me
Ghetto fabulous, Tony Atlas
Zulu Nation in the 80's, in front of Masey's I start my own Chapters
Tyco, Nike glow, velvet pose
Special effects, high-tech armors, murk you after shows
Supercalifragilisticexbealidosious
Ghost'll hollar exbefragilisticcalisuper
Cancoon, catch me in the room eatin group up


Shoe fly shoe, Wally dark Clark crew
Fuck y'all wan' do? Crack a brew, smoke an L or two
And flip like, yellin for the whole click, it's sick like
The way yo' stank bitch eat a dick like
Baby shake yo' shit, hold yo' dick like
Gettin rich like..




Who I'm is? The Phenom, them niggas can't live
Who I'm is? We ain't got shit, something got to give
Y'all done flipped y'all wig, blacked out the crib
Die and live for my nigs and my bad-ass kids, freeze
Looking at your ice like Jeez!
I'm plotting on the mousetrap, about to snatch the cheese
I heard y'all kids is bout that, psychotherapy
You bugging where the couch at, Wu til they bury me
Never tell a lie, like George with the cherry tree
Now it's cherry pie, if it's not broke let it be
Ain't nothing nice in New York
Stick you for your cake and your icing, that tough talk
Don't mean nothing when you're up North
So keep them hands where I can see 'em like you want freedom
You know that saying if you can't join 'em, beat 'em, and push your way in
We ain't acrobats but we flip on occasion
Pick the pace up, pants sagging pull your waist up
Niggas renting slum jewels from Jacob, fool!
You're like "Dude! I don't like your fucking attitude"
Fronting on my Clan from the Stat but we ain't mad at you


Starks with the parcheesi face, measly paced ofays Ghostface
Jump out the window for a little taste
The joopy look, my main bitches call me lazy
Educated birds say, "Ghost you so crazy!"


Cappa slide through with the Ghost
Post up like paint on walls
Drip jewels, big heat
Ruffle inside the bubble goose, it's the Odd Couple
Hollow points follow you home to Staten Island
Playing with the big toys that make noise
Echo in the hall, a scared voice
Niggas start to act choice, but Duncan Hines
Didn't know Betty Crocker had the two nines
Made the club moist, shattered the windows
Dustheads running
The rap kingpin plus the Black Jesus is coming


The words you talk better be the words you walk
Body you in the bed where the nurses are
Put your vein out, watch me insert the dart
Til it plagues from Bricks to the Persian Gulf
Light circuits off, thirty-third of my brain is off
That explains why my language off
My gun aim and cough, y'all ain't trained to brawl
Y'all more like in training bras
Wet behind the ear, you're not prepared
For the project flow, with extra stairs
I pass out a vest to wear (bullets flyin)
Yo, the hard wire, starting bonfires
Pull the mask so you know it's me
And your weed got more seeds than ODB
Can't smoke with ya, watch Ghost tie a rope to ya
Def and Wu will open ya


Eat a dick like (huh) baby shake your shit
Girl you're thick like (huh) getting rich like (huh)


Word, it's me y'all
We in two sixes flirting with bitches, dime plus
Taking pictures, How you doing baby? My name Ghost
Don't get caught up in my chains or the way that I speak
Seek intelligence, slickest nigga going since "Grease"
Check out the grays on the side of my waves
I grew those on Rikers Island
Stressed out, balled up in the cage
Pull a boot out on Jimmy Jam, text takes jam
Silky texture, Jordan jumped up like Clyde Drexler
All up in the parrot, nose numb, real as they come
Biggie's Versaces, snow white rabbit
Hands is like photographic magic
Funeral love, move in when we hug, don't make it a habit
Hit the gym for two weeks, my back all chiseled
Elbows unique now meet the new me
Ghetto fabulous, Tone Atlas
Zulu Nation in the 80's in front of Macy's I start my own chapters
Tyco Nite-Glow velvet pose, special effects
High-tech armors merc you at the shows
Supercalifragalisticexpialidocious

And flip like (huh) killing for the whole
Clique is sick like (huh) you and your stank bitch
Eat a dick like (huh) baby shake your shit
Girl you're thick like (huh) getting rich like (huh)




I got a bird's eye view, like bird and swine flu
I'm sick with it, no cure for shit that I do
Heavy handed when I jotted down a lyric
You ain't half what Havoc is, or anything near it
I'm a ticking timebomb, that sit in your mind palm
The blicky, your mind palm, no planet, we improv
You niggas pussy wearing feelings on your sleeve though
Go kill yourself, your shorty out here giving deep throat
The winner team is over here, check the point spread
Our ball first, give a fuck what the coin said
They try to zoo us, keep it from the shakers, movers
Cause we animals, the valuables, there be a lotta to us
Quick, out with the old, my nigga I be on some newer shit
Whoever got the coolest wrist, add 'em to the list
You be donating for the cause
Why you asking why nigga, do it just because
Never let a good jux go to waste, they see it's about face
The memories of the sound the four pound make
For years through the music, I took 'em a foul place
Life through my lens and how it would be without cake
 buck 50 and bullet wounds
Nothing left to live for so we couldn't lose
Bubblin' with aga, had it poppin' off
Gunpowder residue on the cotton cloth
Lay laws on us yeah but we still wild
And never seasonal my nigga, this was year round
The blood runnin' through our veins
Got us locked up in this cell
Shacked up with the ball and chain 


The more herb I blew, the higher the IQ
Just trying to live, please forgive the evil I do
From W, the double crossing my crew
Dos Equis, my X2, get it, that's times two
I be spittin' raw dawg, the sticky in my paws
Southpaw, kill ya spirit, I get it from my Pa
We outlaws, we live it, no liquor in my bars
Drive 'em crazy in the streets, no different in my car
It's nada, I brought you change, no Obama
Like four quarters, some rappers change for a dollar
It's all aura, I do my thing you ain't gotta
Stop lying like Mufasa, I'm no Hakuna Matata
Boy, bullet holes in the lobby door
If you thinking that i'm a problem, I'm probably yours
Back with the brown, I got 'em leaning like Bobby jaw
Might catch a body and drop it off in somebody's drawer

Yeah, Wu-Tang!
Mobb Deep!
20 years plus in the game!
Yeah Alchemist, I love you kid!






Sort of like Malcolm at the Audubon
They coming for me, time is money no Audemar
See bar-for-bar, I keep it pushing no R&R
No foreign broads and no promotion for foreign cars
The game is ours, lets keep it funky who said he was
Like Staten Island, Italians bleed spaghetti sauce
If y'all ain't shaking or stacking than y'all already lost
Already cross the light, Christ I'm ready for em
Plus anybody that saying no, Im taking numbers
Im taking names, Ill take your chain take this hunger
Pain, pain, pain
Then you feel the thunder and rain I dont talk it like the rainbow
I get it done and the game yall
Do me a favor, dont ever play with my ball
Never been a player-hater I just ain't playing with y'all
You watching lame but look Im taking the charge
Going hard will get you two shots now Im facing the charge


Fire up the la lets go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if youre built for this shit then you might survive
Guess Ill see you when you wake up on the other side


Sort of like Mike at the United Center
Madison Square, Boston Garden I straight ignite on niggas
Lil' nigga your raps aint no fire, that shitll collapse so dont try
I scribble and scratch down in my pad that no lie
That no fake, that uncut, that straight drop, what the fuck
Im pulled over by the jakes, a twenty-eight up in my nuts
For em took away in cuffs Id rather lay up in the dust
Feel like fuck a friend a hundred million haters aint enough
Twist it up
Life is a blunt and the world is my ash tray
I got them quarters and them halves just meet me like halfway
And I need a hundred percent of my profit ain't fucking with half pay
Ain't taking no shorts or losses bitch we ain't fronting no tag day
As I can recollect, praying to God this dopell stretch
Turn mobster warners, work these corners like P90X
Chilling and waiting, patient retaliation just ain't find me yet
Ill take it into Heaven, you couldnt buy me that, remind me that




It's the worlds worst, quick to snatch your man purse
And leave your body head first in the stretched hearse
Murder she wrote, Im known to spit a killer verse
And leave a player blood spilling on his linen shirt
You can Google my name but you ain't gotta search
Im right here in the streets, I'm putting in work
Go ahead, fuck around and get your feelings hurt
Or, you can get carried outta your local church
Im from the old school, I do my own dirt
Mama raised no fool, I did my own work
Keep your wifey close, shes a little flirt
I knew her since '03, I hit the bitch first
Im the reason why your baby mama water burst
Ive been marvelous since birth, you can ask my Earth
Its not a problem to show you how the shotty work
I put your body in the dirt, but what the dollars worth






Yo, Sway, man. I can't even describe it, man. The situation was crazy, bruh. If I was a gorilla I would say it was bananas, B. For real, the man just- he just took over the whole situation, god. Listen -


Man, it is what it is
Can't understand a man if you ain't lived what he lived
Roaches in the crib, ain't got no food up in the fridge
Plus the crime running rampant and it's screwing up the kids
Sway, admit, what kind of paradise is this?
I just want my 40 acres and some carats on the wrist
But these snakes is trying to gather in the pit
When you get a cottonmouth, plucking ashes off the clip
Off the rip, now a challenger exists
And he bulletproof, shoot, what kind of caliber is this?
Got thugs in the store with the barrel on your lips
Saying, "empty out the drawer" before he pound you with the grip
Lord, who to call when no one obeys the law
And there ain't no Iron Man that can come and save us all?
Power to the people and Luke Cage the cause
And the cops got it wrong, we don't think Cage involved
Look, dog, a hero, never had one
Already took Malcolm and Martin, this is the last one
I beg your pardon, somebody pulling a fast one
Now we got a hero for hire and he a black one
And bullet-hole hoodies is the fashion
We in Harlem's Paradise, tell the Captain
That I'm about to trade the mic for a Magnum
Give up my life for Trayvon to have one


Yeah, 'cause this is bulletproof love
And you already know what a bulletproof does
So you can take it from a bulletproof thug
The hood got his back, dog, bulletproof love
The blood thicker than mud
And who am I to judge if you get a gun in the club?
'Cause you already know what a bulletproof does
When the hood got your back, dog, bulletproof love


Yeah, shoutout to Pop. RIP, my brother. The streets is crazy nowadays. People say we don't need another hero, but now we got one whether you like it or not. Luke Cage, please believe it, sir. The streets got your back. You already bulletproof love, baby




Aiyyo, wordup dunn
Man you know how I feel
Gotta be more to it than this, word up

*doing an impression of scarface*
This what it's all about dunn? uh?
Eating, drinking, f**king, sucking (can't understand)

Whattup, I don't know baby
Nah man, it's not, it's not yo word up
I'm tellin you right now
I know this shit though, aiyyo

Disagreeable, foul energy, tryin to
Absorb my energy, knowin it's the strength of me
Take a few to give me a edge
My green light shine bright, kryptonite type
Fully operational, my physical cream
Put the bottles of smoke down, pick up a magazine
Popped it inside the ar-15
Put it aside, round up the regime
While you rely on religion, I hold a nine
On the mission, to pull fire on your opposition
Revelation was the vision of this
Crack the heavens, it's time to bring the business, shit
My story goes back to them lost pyramids
I'm seeing things that you won't believe exists
He use a lunar-tick, suspended in time dunn
The secondary light got your mind
You rock the fatigues, to squab until ? popular? guns
But are you really prepared, for the things to come?


Check it out
True underground sound from the boogie down
Uptown downtown gather round for the showdown, in they faces
Calling out these racists, at rolling stone
Spin details and other places, krs is the source
F**k these magazine leadin hip-hop off course
You'll print about black mayors, black senators
Why you ain't got no black editors?
Everytime I do an interview in rolling stone
They sendin me a writer that look like he's home alone
Ignorant, to the culture and the microphone
This has got to stop -- your whole spot
Is blown sky high, battle why try?
My view is bird's eye, scopin with my third eye
You don't understand, why you're publically banned

Until you recognize the writing skills of a black man
Black editor, all of us ain't thuggin
Gossiping over who's homosexual
Some of us are black intellectuals, up in harlem world
You can't get with me, so now in midtown
You wanna stop and talk to me?
Bitch ass journalist, is this your fake hip-hop publication?
Look I'm burnin this


How many didn't want to see it happen
Street moves, live from staten, if life is a joke, nobody laughin
Hate to see a brother do good through legal action
So you sabotage and throw a def in the squad
Fo'-fo's blastin, keep the po-po flashin
These dark soul assassins, jake's hate the gods with a passion
So I keep it movin in an orderly, fashion
Pedal to the floor -- peep the jim crow law, mind control theory
Y'all niggas don't hear me, generation next
Droppin fast who's next, next to get wet
By the reign of the tech-knowledgy, follow me
Open up wide now, swallow me, every calorie
Is reality the truth, the whole truth and
Nothin but the truth, taste is the proof
These niggas want the juice, and in the crossfire
Be the youth, who didn't learn to duck when they shoot


What kind of party is this, it's that political kind
Where america's best, most hypocritical minds
Try they hands at keepin y'all deaf dumb and blind
And for the right dollar sign, do white collar crime
Behind suits, and clean shaves
I confuse em and use em as tools and slaves
Because my schools is graves and jobs is plantations --
I robs the damn nation
So I can live in luxury, you f**ks with me
You marryin the dirt and i'ma throw in the tux for free
I tell the people what they wanna hear
I make em laugh and cheer, and then they re-elect me every year
So when the coast is clear, I stop duckin
And start back doin dope, cussin and f**kin
I kiss the babies, shake hands, wave and smile for flicks
That's my style, my pol-i-tricks
Triple-six convicts, lyin is automatic
In the government, republican or democratic
F**k freedom, justice and equality
Nigga just accept my apology and suck this trick-knowledgy

Sack of funk, (Uhh)
Company Records, (What's up B-Way)


Bust shots, Holdin down the rock for the west-a
Suckas want static, I upload the teck-a
Hustle from the block, Shot, Been livin Viesta
Busta who I be, The k to the aos-a


Church, Now, Uhh Ohh, Like ???
Man if Mef ain't that shit by now, I'm soon to be
When I choke hold mics, I don't give em room to breathe
I'm just doin me, But bitch if your fine, I'll do ya free
By now if yall don't know who it be, Don't make me tell
Just know that a killa mic, Like that kid from ATL
If you fail a plan, Baby plan to fail
Man my game ugly, As that nigga Sam Cassell
I'm so funky, I can't even stand to smell, (Come on)
Life's a drag, Roll it up, Hand in hand
Don't get comfy, I'll clip your style like a monkey
Even then you'll need more than Aston Kutcher to punk me
My 4-5 bars, Just one shot will clear the block like it's time for 106 & Park
Staten Island droppin your ass, We mean business
We quick to put a shot in your ass, Like free clinics




See death around the corner, Now I'm all up on ya
Silencer on my 4-5, Yeah I'm bout to dome ya
You tell by the weed, That it's California
I-A ready for gun play
I'm masked like OJ from the 5-0 on the freeway for the game
Niggas is wack and lame
I'll knock out your jaw frame and make you mumble my name
I'm thirsty, Niggas can't work me
The Uda, Pussy recruiter, Sharp Shooter, The hood remover
Bullets is all net, That mean I shoot right through ya
Kaos Brought don't give a fuck, What hit ya
You can tell I be startin, Why you hoes up in my Chucks nigga
So get out my path, I feel a wrath
I feel a blast like you opened up the door on back draft
The new Ice Cube, Takin pictures with toe tags
Fuck all that blunt shit, I'm back to Zig Zags
Still feel the calico type of flow, To let a peasant know
That this W coast will do it the most
Fuck all that Docey doe, And Hokey poke
I've been bustin heat with barrels long as telescopes
My Ingle Watts bangas in the cut, Ready to roll
Hennessy drinkin, Wag wavers, And endo smoke
I guess it's bout time I let you punk niggas know
Don't ask me where I'm from, I bang the whole west coast




You can tell I'm from the west coast, Home of the best smoke
Home of the hood rat, Home of the finest hoes
Home of the octagon, City of the champions
Fuck what your going through, Pass me the marijuan
Niggas get blitzed and be talkin that gangsta shit
Then just hit em with somethin that'll have em fakin they last shit
I go Black Panther style, Against the law
If my right hand jam I start bustin the south paw
Break out the tissue, Hand em out, They gonna miss you
I'ma have your whole family standin in line waitin to kiss you
America's most wanted part dues is in progress
So when you land in LAX you better watch every step
It's filled with land mines, And bomb threats one time
Then suckas with bad ??? is the niggas who meet they maker
Balls so hard, Just call be Mr. Laker
Flashin my card, I'ma world famous player






Today I'll talk about kindness
Justice, faith, and kindness
I want you to listen carefully
Kindness and faith, are the foundation
Without them, we can't become good people
And with justice, we know we can lead a good life
And how can I be a good man then, eh?
Huh... well, first of all, you have to practice honesty
Mmm?
Keep your temper, never lose control of yourself
Keep control
Be patient, if you learn to do these things, you can master anything


Out of nowhere, there came a caravan
This was around a campfire light
A lovely woman in motion
Her hair was as dark, as the night


Cruisin on the interstate, just follow while I innovate
Too many try and imitate, medallion like a dinner plate
Front and get your dinner ate, chinchilla for the winter, wait
I'm tryin to bring the "Sexy Back" like Timbaland and Timberlake
Spittin like a calico, kush from a Cali ho
Tell that joker "tally ho", put shots in that Denali yo
RZA you know how we go on them 20's, that's how we roll
And I don't eat berries but eat a Berry like Halle though
The game criminal, my, my chain figaro
My, my dame's pigeon-toed, I'm still the same nigga though
Uh, kid rock a fitted low, still got a wicked flow
And I'm like Barry Bonds on anything that RZA throw


On anything that RZA throw, Ironman's invisible
I left my chick for cheatin on me, now that bitch is miserable
Poppin bottles, paintin hella Wallo's on my physical
We gon' have a ball, might as well pick a testicle
Purple haze festivals, smoke a nigga like a bowl
Fuck a coma, now the state you layin is a vegetable
You wanna see me? Like you ain't checkable?
You like a CD, I burn you and I wrecked a few...




Only God, has lept into avenged mind
And can distinguish, good, from evil
Ha ha ha ha

 Aye Yo Cappa!!


We gotta get more cake together, so we could branch out
Preserve land, get a boat and a ranch house
Call me a dreamer, but I hustle for real
You thought that I fell off but now I'm attackin the field
All in Chicago, grindin, puttin it down
Crush blocks of MC's, I ain't playin around
Yo you heard me on The Bassment, givin it to 'em
Fake dudes hidin theyself, but I could see through 'em
Diggler, what? I'm tryin to live and raise kids
While you throwin up ya sign, I'm layin 'em down kid
Plus I'm back home now, doin my thing
Thirty dollars to Medina just to cop me a ring




A good friend, holds his drink
Bad company makes bad wine!
Drinking among friends
Red wine means a good life
A few drinks bring comfort
Two drinks are enough!
Money can't buy courage!
Riches mean nothing to us!
Brilliant, a display of genius




Shake them niggas


Scary hours no money out, smash the Guinness Stout
Play the outfield, Lucille, switched cracks on shields
She's a rich fiend sacrifice her fam shift them niggas
To Queens
Guess jeans she charged thirty-five beans
Hit the cell phone, regulate with well known Tone
A Wally kingpin who also slam the strike edition
What up? Corleone smoke the bone, Tone phone me
What up? He tried to slang there, address him with chrome only
Grady with the gray beard, transporting for him
Rocking Nike Air, Rastafarian bird, piping that
Switchin Benzes, ten carat nigga with gold lenses
Fronting like he's sitting on a lump, he's sitting on junk
You wanna pull a heist, draw guns and robberies
You wanna rock rep, step in yellow Wallabies
Names arraigned, they're Century Fox, little Glocks
Them niggas with stocks, ______ blocks
Rich lifestyle, spoiled like an ordinary white child
But right now, Sun it still shine, shed light now
Breakdown, liquidate God, fucking grab the nickel plate
'Spenser: For Hire', tension when we mention Dryer
He's a slave cop, behave pop
Isuzu Beige Top will blow that cat at the Purple Haze spot


I remember sticking fiends at the one-six-ooh
When we was starving, ducking five-oh, paying 'em dues
Times is hard in the slums I'm from, they got us barred in
We warring and cage dodging, ripping and robbing
Got the NARC sabotaging, slipping cracks in
Your camoflouging, now you snitching on the squadron
That's something niggas can't pardon
City overrun by young gun with bad intention and Wu-Wear garment
So I see no need to mention, the potency
Of a sting from a killa bee, kicking the battery
Out the back of them wisecracks
Distorted for your get high, you hijack
These friendly skies ain't for you, they for me and mine
This the year of the grimy nigga, ragtime
Keep these niggas on the run, peep my Clan emblem
Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from


Catch us swimming with these sharks now, you rap villains
(I feel the same way you niggas feeling)
We feel the same way you feeling, let it be known (let it be known)
What the blood clot you niggas dealing, you crash dummies
Cash rules, still don't nothing move but the money


Aiyyo strongarm that kid right there with wavy hair
Billy Johnson snatched him out his whip in Times Square
Took his Pumas, nameplate, dude lost weight
Summer '88, started a fight, that can't wait
Ask Dorothy, same kid pussy up in Marcy
Blazing that Ted Rossi up in The Marquees
He lost like a hundred ounces, Jake rushed his houses
Had him on the porch, ass no trousers
This souped up, individual stuck, the new stuff
Same kid crying on the stand with Judge Cuffner
Kissed him with odd numbers three to nine style
Before he left he flashing his face like Denzel
Richard Dale took his Beaver, underwall balling his whip
Mussy dropped and split his wig with the heater
His shape-up was all fucked up, as he had me laughing
God you see how he was laid out in the grass
With dirt in his mouth, Slim woke him up told him he wild out
Blood leaking from his teeth he smiled like he gummed out
Big bolo, stacking his shit, financed a Volvo
He copped his shit from a small coffee shop in SoHo
He still pussy, he sell his dust up on the Lower East
Posing like he rapping out...





Thanks for coming out. God bless you. Goodnight




Yeah, yeah, huahh hahh
Murda, murda, murda, kill kill kill
That's right killer, killer
Murda murda murda, kill kill kill
Flex, flex, flex, flex
I'm going to kill you


Slowly I turn, step by step, through the back window I crept
Silent as a mouse on the set while everybody in the house slept
I disconnect the phones and the rest
Find a butcher knife, cut the power lines to the lights
Now a nigga wild for the night
I come like the livin dead, straight from the dirt
Back to avenge his own death on this Earth
Ever hear of Jason, then you know my work
Down to the basement, the dog get it first
I can't help myself, my thoughts ain't my own
The voices in my head just won't leave me alone
Murda murda murda, kill kill kill
Pissing on the car seats, flattening the wheels
So there's no escape from the fate that awaits
No one to witness the horror taking place
Yeah, now I'm on my way up the stairs
To the bedroom of my prey unaware
Heads will be hung from the chimney with care
With hopes that the police soon will be here
I'm a killer

C'est la gnration qu'a le mpris
Drogue alcool, entend les cris
D'une mre qui pleure
En voyant son fils cribl de balles, pas de rpit
Faut de la caille pour tailler d'ici
Donnes-moi le coffre fais pas l'imbcile
Plus rien  perdre , j'ai connu la merde
Voil ce que te diront les p'tits
Aujourd'hui le respect n'est plus
Braque son frre aprs avoir bu
Trois-quatre verres de vodka-Redbull
En portant un pare-balles sous le pull
Fuck la school , vive la street
a fume, a boit, sous la pilule
Le loup aboie pour avoir ta thune
Touche du bois pour pas qu'il t'allume
Les parents dsempars
Les professeurs pris  coups de pied
Les jours de l'an avec les pompiers
Toutes les nuits en GAV
Les nerfs  vif, la coke dans le pif
Agressif pour un soutif' ou un peu de beef
Oh my god, que Dieu garde nos p'tits frres qui arrivent


(Soprano)
Eh oh, eh oh

 (Method Man)
a Va ? Parlez-vous franais ce soir ?

When house threw me outta my place I make moves
Gimme the ice and the cake I cake you
It's like a fat woman with weight I can't loose
Yeah it's holding square yeah it's hot
The Method Man, j'ai fum et toi ?
Yeah I don't speak much french I make french shoes
I love me some french toasts and hate french food
My resume been dope, my kinfolks too
Some of you smoke guns my guns smoke you
My fre, I'm hot my frre
If it's about gwap or G-spot I'm man
I'm letting my heat pop, it don't stop there
If it's you and me you ain't gotta prayer
That's life !


(Soprano)

I must tell you that the Clan is a danger to the public
But still for many men just to hear of the name
Fills them with hate and loathing
But why? They've never harmed anyone
I'm afraid they did
*beat drops*
In the past there's something that they would like to forgive
First, I'll tell you about their style, planned techniques
The main style
"Shaolin Finger Jab!"


Yo..
*sounds of fighting*
(Uh-huh)


We are watchin your whole group
You been busy here
Around the clock, all we need is your orders to move
Met a lot of crosses last night
Young and old!
You been busy here
I respect that!


Yeah, (Eh yo), yeah
Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in (Yo)
Come on! You know what it is
(Thou must bust shots all the time, kid)
(Eh yo, eh yo, eh yo) We're back!


Peep The Jump Off, ain't nothin sweet, get dumped off
Frontin like you won't get deaded and bumped off
Drastic son, master guns that'll run up in plastic ones
And then go, crash in the slums
One tight army, few good men that'll rep
Invade you strongly, Prince of Wales swimmin on feet
Props'll sell, all yellow L's, cops sleepin on nails
Niggas get realer than real, yo
Flash the brown, last time was crowned
All navy Woolridge, Wu kicks, movin them pounds, yo
Last on niggas, great adventures of my niggas
And Castro pictures, sendin a rash out the kitchens
Like the wind, invite the grin, watch niggas rewrite the trend
Wu niggas did it again, yo
Unhighly, octane, die cast metal frame
Lame, let another man with heat handle beef


Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in


Yo, spark the intro, relevant info
Load up the keyboard, 105 tempo
Most heated battles, I've blasted MCs
Some said that the bullets flew by like angry bees
Wu entered on the level where we would wait and listen
While one flashed metal, eight calculate position
The world snapped, once we combined our rap
Drastic measures, priceless treasures on Nap'
Our swords swing, windchill Mount Aerie
Native plant standin' on the tall-grass prairie
Snares and kicks, off the project bricks
It's no act the producer played the role with drumsticks
The warning came unnoticed
It's like the shot on the dock of the bay
That slayed Otis, the Nine-Lotus
Each one adjust to his own environment
Formulate this great LP, a hundred rounds spent
Niggas bent on the fruitless search for nourishment
They long for this proper guidance, encouragement




It be the Lost Tribe, 7 days locked in the dungeon
Foamin at the mouth, mad dog in this production
The uncontrolled substance got me spittin up bars disgustin
The last temptation of the son of David Ruffin
Hold my mic sideways when bustin
On Judgement Day runnin through Hell, yellin and cussin
At MC's in my circumfrance, y'all niggas hand-cuffin
These hoes and ain't read them they rights or nothin
Keep lustin, yeah and I'ma a keep hustlin
With Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in
You know me, everytime you kiss that ho you blow me
You blow trial trin to walk a mile in my Sauconys




We just touched down, Wu shuttle, private jet
Stepped off the plane, the world wept
Roll with the Witty Unpredictable
Talent All Natural, rock with the beatles of hip-hop
Mathematical imperial manifestation of greatness
Make wiz's scream and shout at the top of their breath essence
Captured on tape is precious
Bless mic pure deafness, awaken from you sleep mistake
When the God bring rain, hail, snow to the earthquake




You've been busy
Are you mastered?
{*Repeat 3x*}
You've been busy here..



* remake of Das EFX's "Mic Checka"


Riggidy-raow! Steppin out the crowd throwin bolos
Fliggidy-flame on! Twin chrome fo'-fo's
Loadin it up, cocking it back, ready to splash for real
Spit flows out the gill, God tried to build
It's hectic, 45-6 gimme a grip
That's more dollars in them thongs than them go-go chicks
Bitch I'm drunk, pumpin slugs out of cannon
Shut ya after-party down when Meth and Red in
Check it, Bricks and Shaolin, NO JOKE!
And when I hit the pussy call me Daddy Long Stroke
Oh Anna, I'm hittin pigeons out in Atlanta
Banana-split; HACH-TOO, SPIT! (OH SHIT!)
Sticking ya ripping ya for all ya funds
I wet ya like a hundred and forty-one water guns
Cock d' like Rocky {got you scared to death}
So hold on you bitches {cause here come} RED-METH!


Microphone-check, micro-microphone checka!
Microphone-check, micro-microphone checka!
Microphone-check, micro-microphone checka!
Fuck with me and Meth and we break ya fuckin neck-a (Remember this?)
Microphone-check, micro-microphone checka! (Remember this?)
Microphone-check, micro-microphone checka! (Remember this?)
Microphone-check, micro-microphone checka! (Remember this?)
Microphone-check, micro-microphone checka!


Okay to hey hey baby, me and Doc about to blow
My Saturday Nights are Special and they're pointed at your nose
Aiy-yo, save the speculations and the rumors
Comin sooner then you think I knock a fat bitch out her bloomers
Givin tumors, hardcore, givin it to 'em raw
Landshark, Southpaw, so kids say I Jabb-er-jaw
One-two, no ending or beginning to my cypher
I'm winning tell the news like Peter Jennings
Depending, on any given day I'm representing
The struggle, my great grand who lived through the lynching
Oh yes y'all, if you got the weed, who got the blunts?
Take a guess y'all, Kool-Aid bustin thruough the wall
Mr. Meth y'all, AHH-CHU! Comment alllez vous?
I used to hawk chickens, now I'm maxin with Badu
I represent - Wu, my uzi weighs a - ton
I'm swingin the track from Staten
Cause Staten's where I'm from

 - repeat to fade



We gonna get you high (*whispered in background 6 times*)
Let's get high (*whispered in background 2 times*)

(B-Real)
I flow rhymes off just like weed in your chest
Think you got endo, hold your breath
Spittin on the track with Red and Meth
Holdin up a fat, when you smoke a cassette
Or CDs, we bees the ones with the Ouija's
Spread it on the arm, come on believe me
Look who it is, it's the funky feel
Smokin assassin from Cypress Hill
We think she's just resonated?
Fillin my brain till it's saturated
When you get the crushed weed and cultivate it
Give it to the hoes who love to hate it
Cause blunts get filled like Hershey Highways
I don't give a fuck who sits where I blaze
Chillin at the rainbow high and faded
You saving that bump(??), then isolate it

(Method Man)
Is there a Doctor in the house?
We like fuck that, nut sacks in your mouth
Lemme show you what a thug about
We can talk or we can slug it out
Better yet, you can bark like a bitch when I thug it out
There it is, a better a kid, ahead of his
Time to settle this, like men
I'm pipin hot, exciting
Right in the gym or hype in them, alright then
All day I drink and smoke
Shell toe with ankles in ya both
Cent, five cents, ten cents, dollar
Rocwilder blend the track and getting hotter
Ask your boy, now pass your boy something to smoke
Cause you have had nothing to throat, swallow
Bang the track, bring your bat
Ain't too many that can hang with that
So why bother

(Chorus)
Cisco Kid was a friend of mine
Hell yea
Cisco Kid was a friend of mine
Hell yea
He drank whiskey, Pancho drank the wine
Hell yea
He drank whiskey, Pancho drank the wine
Hell yea

(Cypress Hill)
Yea, send all, and fall back
And who wrote on this track
I don't really give a fuck
Put the pen down lets toss them up
Soul assasins, Latin thugs
Whole damn world know about us
Rhymes we kick and weed we puff
Get tus vatos all fucked up
And sing along to my get high song
Had you choking off of four foot bong
Cypress Hill and weed, can't go wrong
Keep you smoking like Cheech and Chong

(Redman)
Yo, call me that Doctor
P-Funk or chronic blower
Pussy smoker, strap toker, back broker
Hash burns in your pull out sofa
This is my brain on drugs
Move out my way cuz, cause I might run you over
Bitches bounce your titties
I bounce with a pump shotgun
Look out, the highest man in the world
Walkin off with my hand on your girl
Can't drink and can't stand in the world
Niggas, two puffs and then pass me the L
What you talking about I'm not high enough to start that party
Triple beater enter the stage with a gauge
Don't shoot nobody
What you ain't high enough?
Do I gotta jump out there and tie you up?
Strap a bomb to your mouth
Till you wired up
Till the Park Ranger call the Firetruck
And said "Hey motherfucker, what you be smoking on?"
I said "Hey motherfucker, why do you want some?"
Yo, yo, give me the gun, we don't need to fight
Hold that blunt, I'll give you a light
Don't no nigga want to die tonight
With all this weed, get high tonight.. BITCH!

Chorus 2 times




I get tore up, I get tore up under city lights
Tore up every city, I get tore up under city lights
I get tore up, I get tore up under city lights
Tore up under city lights, tore up under city lights


Yo, I'm rolling in my ride, my eyes real chinky
Hit 145, buy like 12 twinkies
Today a good day, I know, don't jinx it
I 'will' keep a 'smith', just like Jada Pinkett
Baby, without blinking, I do it my way
I shit on folks, the opposite of R. K
I'm rude, pardon me, I'm too hood
Doc on your mind all the time, like New E.R.A
Who am I? That nigga too fly
My mama gave birth on Continental Airlines
I ain't lying, I'm back, boy, you hit the backboard
I'm all swish, make a memo on your black board
This class here, nigga, is for the underground
UGK, Doc and Meth, locking the summer down
And I ain't playing games, homie so get it right
Cuz I 'get tore, I get tore up' under city lights




I dropped in '95, now I'm on 95
South in the Dirty, been "Ridin Dirty" since Dirty died
I gets it early, my nigga, heard me, I'm certified
And when I ride, I'm with Reggie Noble, New Jersey Drive
I make it happen, homie I take you back when I was wearing ponies
And them older niggas was snapping on me
How many rappers know me? I know what cash own
Face it, this game I take it, in holy matrimony
And now can't nothing hold me, I fucks with UGK
Some dudes is more like Kobe, I'm more like Rudy Ray
You either in it pimping, or you just in the way
I love this life that I'm living, your shit can end today
Two things to know about me, I guess I'll never change
And keep this money like Southern Cali, it never rains
And I ain't playing games wit ya, so get it right
And I 'get tore, I get tore up' under city lights




Yeah, UGK for life R.I.P. to the Pimp
Miss you bro
This for you bankroll
Well the king of the trill is up in this bitch
Drop the top, but I hit the switch
You see my leather seats tucked and stitched
Texas, nigga, we getting rich
Fuck a hater, man, fuck a snitch
G-Code nigga, we don't love the po-po
No more swag, now pass the dough dough
We keep it super tight like pants in SoHo
I'm bout my dough, ho, so don't play with my bread
Man, I be trying to stop the violence nowadays so it's dead
I'm popping that trunk and grabbing that chopper, putting that K to ya head
I'd rather be laying up in the bed with your baby and may getting head
Yeah, my Cadillac car is candy painted, dripping like Bernadette
My steering wheel is woodgrain, I grip it and turn it quick
I'm riding bowls, black with yellow stripes, like a Steeler
And as far as the rims go, I'm an 84 dealer
A SLAB peeler when I mash out in the Caddy
Lean it back up on the leather, man, and smoking on a fatty
This UGK 4 Life, if you ain't know you better get it right
Why, 'I get tore, I get tore up' under city lights




UGK, Redman, Method Man, in the fucking building, bitch



I get tore up, I get tore up under city lights
I get tore up, I get tore up under city lights
Tore up every city, I get tore up under city lights
I get tore up, I get tore up under city lights
Tore up under city lights, tore up under city lights
I get tore up, I get tore up under city lights
Tore up under city lights, tore up under city lights
I get tore up, I get tore up under city lights
Tore up under city lights, tore up under city lights

Yo, I'm rolling in my ride, my eyes real chinky
Hit 145, buy like 12 twinkies
Today a good day, I know, don't jinx it
I 'will' keep a 'smith', just like Jada Pinkett
Baby, without blinking, I do it my way
I shit on folks, the opposite of R. K
I'm rude, pardon me, I'm too hood
Doc on your mind all the time, like New E.R.A
Who am I? That nigga too fly
My mama gave birth on Continental Airlines
I ain't lying, I'm back, boy, you hit the backboard
I'm all swish, make a memo on your black board
This class here, nigga, is for the underground
UGK, Doc and Meth, locking the summer down
And I ain't playing games, homey, so get it right
Cuz I 'get tore, I get tore up' under city lights

I get tore up, I get tore up under city lights
Tore up every city lights, I get tore up under city lights
I get tore up, I get tore up under city lights
Tore up under city, I get tore up under city lights
I get tore up, I get tore up under city lights
Tore up under city lights, tore up under city lights
I get tore up, I get tore up under city lights
Tore up under city lights, tore up under city lights

I dropped to 95, now I'm on 95
South and the dirty been riding dirty since Dirty died
I gets it early, my nigga, heard me, I'm certified
And when I ride, I'm with Reggie Noble, New Jersey Drive
I make it happen, homey, I take you back when I was wearing ponies
And them older niggas was snapping on me
How many rappers know me? I know what cash own
Face it, this game I take it, in holy matrimony
And now can't nothing hold me, I f*cks with UGK
Some dudes is more like Kobe, I'm more like Rudy Ray
You either in it pimping, or you just in the way
I love this life that I'm living, your shit can end today
Two things to know about me, I guess I'll never change
And keep this money like Southern Cali, and never rain
And I ain't playing games wit ya, so get it right
And I 'get tore, I get tore up' under city lights

I get tore up, I get tore up under city lights
Tore up every city lights, I get tore up under city lights
I get tore up, I get tore up under city lights
Tore up under city, I get tore up under city lights
I get tore up, I get tore up under city lights
Tore up under city lights, tore up under city lights
I get tore up, I get tore up under city lights
Tore up under city lights, tore up under city lights

For the king of the trill is up in this bitch
Drop the top, but I get the switch
You see my level, he tuck the stitch
Texas, nigga, we getting rich
F*ck a hater, man, f*ck a snitch
G-Code nigga, we don't love the po-po
No more swag, now pass the dough dough
We keep it super tight like pants in SoHo
I'm bout my dough, ho, so don't play with my bread
Man, I be trying to stop the violence nowadays so it's dead
I'm popping that trunk and grabbing that chopper, putting that K to ya head
I'd rather be laying up in the bed with your baby and may getting head
Yeah, my Cadillac car is candy painted, dripping like Bernadette
My steering wheel is woodgrain, I grip it and turn it quick
I'm riding bowls, black with yellow stripes, like a Steeler
And as far as the rims go, I'm an 84 dealer
A smile peeler when I mash out in the Cady
Lean it back up on the leather, man, and smoking on a fatty
This UGK 4 Life, if you ain't know you better get it right
Why, 'I get tore, I get tore up' under city lights

I get tore up, I get tore up under city lights
Tore up every city lights, I get tore up under city lights
I get tore up, I get tore up under city lights
Tore up under city, I get tore up under city lights
I get tore up, I get tore up under city lights
Tore up under city lights, tore up under city lights
I get tore up, I get tore up under city lights
Tore up under city lights, tore up under city lights

UGK, Redman, Method Man, in the f*cking building, bitch

Call it the Hollow Bone syndrome line
Select sweet nine, face this, watch his whole face lift
Bracelets, murder niggas, luxurious, banks I was draped
Caked out, half a million dollars in coats
Flows is genetic, the Corleone connection in all
Selection, stock brokers with coats on
Make coke suggestion, all twin glizzies
Fireman, Gucci boots on, sideways action
Murder niggas fear me yo
Cash that he did Clinton, rentin his mother crib out
We send organize the Bill of Rights get lid
Drugs that Hendrix was on, conversatin like the Dutch
Richie Conaway, Goodfellas who honor Rae
Flows that blow thru your roll and Holland

Half the year, half my niggas sittin upstairs

The rules and commandments, that void, deceit
Cruelty and unkindness, always help the weak
Never despise the poor, always respect yourself

That's the part of the game, that's the part of the game, that niggas

I'm the type of nigga you need in the clutch
Anybody disrespecting the brand they get touched
Def Squad, Wu we coming through can't you tell a
Bunch of niggas walking down the block like it's Selma
But we strapped with an automat'
Just in case they act up we fighting back
Sorry Martin, I ain't the one starting, I'm home chilling
I gotta cook and do homework with my children


But I'm back at it, rhyme and beat making
This dope like a habit, these cats got to have it
The MP breakdown, I'm beating on the tablet
I ain't letting no one breathe, go ask Fabolous
Enough's enough, the stuff y'all releasing
Had to call Method Man up to start beasting
Everybody scared to speak up
What you afraid of, you don't wanna get beat up?
Fuck it, you suck, I said it
Ease up, I'm not Tyson but it hit you it freeze ups
Schwarzenegger
I got a cop lady-friend that gave me a tazer
So I'm gon go to jail for life for killing a hater
So while I'm in the streets I'm getting paper
Locking down the blocks don't fuck around and get shot homie
Duke you soft, comforter
These chicks ain't loyal my homeboy, he humping her
Fuck y'all


I'm the type of nigga you need in the clutch
Anybody disrespecting the brand they get touched
Def Squad, Wu we coming through can't you tell a
Bunch of niggas walking down the block like it's Selma
But we strapped with an automat'
Just in case they act up we fighting back
Sorry Martin, I ain't the one starting, I'm home chilling
I gotta cook and do homework with my children, Meth


E, check they persona non grata
Prizing in the game one nada
I guzzle Ghost Lager
You steal a 40 thief, Ali Baba
Corner store robber I feel sorry for your mama
I'm a menace, a monster
Meth lab chemist with the contra, no limit
They only see murder they ain't in it
Imposters, pop one minute then they mobsters
We get it
Pretend it went pop or it's hot, love pretending
I ain't playing the fun ended
Still not a player like Big Pun, no pun intended
We in these tenements, big guns second amendment
Gives you the right to bear one, I recommend it
You timid, here's a middle finger, you finished
This other middle finger's for anybody offended
Them gimmicks, see I spot 'em just like a blemish
I criticize the image, cause everybody's a critic


I'm the type of nigga you need in the clutch
Anybody disrespecting the brand they get touched
Def Squad, Wu we coming through can't you tell a
Bunch of niggas walking down the block like it's Selma
But we strapped with an automat'
Just in case they act up we fighting back
Sorry Martin, I ain't the one starting, I'm home chilling
I gotta cook and do homework...


Yo, welcome everyone to my thoughts
I carry the hammer like judge in court
The streets them gone wild
Right through the cannabis plant
And when I chant every verse you can actually see the sound cloud
Wow, Redman you done grown up
Grown man do grown man shit what you expect
Rap and drug dealing, the same thing
The strength depends on yo' connects, I was taught well
Never wrote a verse sitting in a cell
But I'm cold with it, a little sickle in his cell
Chicks love a nigga they tripping on his cell
And I tell 'em my album out, hit me with a sale
My bruh said when I rap, talk to 'em
I said cool I might as well, harpoon 'em
I got a gun from x boxing on
Women and step kids they gotta duck when the step pops
That's why I'm international
Tryna turn up and get beat down, this is hip hop
You wanna walk in my shoes, I'm like
Pardon you I got Jordans on, and them are flip flops


I'm the type of nigga you need in the clutch
Anybody disrespecting the brand they get touched
Def Squad, Wu we coming through can't you tell a
Bunch of niggas walking down the block like it's Selma
But we strapped with an automat'
Just in case they act up we fighting back
Sorry Martin, I ain't the one starting, I'm home chilling
I gotta cook and do homework with my children




So what we smoke cancer sticks and weed and all that good shit
Fuck the world, word up
Sunz of Man, Method Man, True Mast', collaboration


Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs
Brothers want grub gotta take it in blood
Because is you down or are you down just because?
Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs


Yo, when you least expect is when we attack, in fact
Your format, is not yet suitable for combat
Still dissident factions within the Kingdom
Campaign desperate attempts to take your freedoms
Emphatically, wack strategy, don't impress me
Impulsiveness'll only bring you tragedy, test me
Descent to the essence quickly, niggas strictly flip
Fuckin with this royal assembly, the Sunz of Man
Summon me, Chief Administrator of the Law
True Master in this hardcore Art of War
I explore the depths on conflict and with no pretense
Found the best strategy the most impressive defense
So when you rush to attack, it be I to crush your force
And exhaust your whole supply
Don't send for reinforcements, give orders for men to maintain
They respective borders, or it's a God damn slaughter


Shots in the park, it be on after dark
Hungry like the Wolf when the beef starts to cook
When push come to shove, we push through the club
Pocket full of bud, baby armed with the snub
Nosed I suppose, you get body-snatched when you doze
Recognize your friends from your foes
Or here lie another one victimized
Left for The Fly, now what size is this?
Nigga your size, and I would be much obliged
To get a fatter piece of that pie
Still got my Eyes on the Prize, and like Gloria
I will survive, at war with the warrior
Hot with the vibe, pennies, turn the heat up, and bend me
Prepare for the next milleni'
I can't sleep, I'm in the shit knee deep
In a race against time, beat your motherfucking beat
Hold your satellite Son, I'm from where you from
Same shit different slum, where we about to go
Ain't no need for the gun, I treat you to a slice
When we done, and all minds are one, yo


Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs
Brothers want grub gotta take it in blood
Because is you down or are you down just because?
Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs


I be the Rabbi watched by snake eyes as the playa hate rise
New York state side to the West side
Fuck the best rhyme, best respect mine
From here to Palestine watch Sunz of Man climb
I could tell a fake from a handshake for man's sake
The hidden truth, I translate til the land quake
I plan my escape on the good fan base
Strictly satisfaction like the Sunz of Man tape
No copy or biting off of what your man make
It's 1998, get your own mind state
In 1999 write your own platinum rhymes
Can you see my love even though we be with thugs?
Yo, words and keyboards we please the Lord
Lyrics feed the poor, while the rich receive the sword
Couldn't stay in one spot too long, split in fours
Told the truth before tours, four artists four doors
I rock the concert til my arm hurt, doing God's work
While you star search, I take your mind to Mars' dirt
Uhh, what..
I said, can you see my love even though we be with thugs?


This mathematical rhythmatical mechanism enhances my wisdom
Prodigal Sunn the lover Islam keeps me calm
From doing you harm, when I attack, it's Vietnam
Through CD-ROM, the mega bomb severs the ice in your charm
Too late for Salaam, slugs rip through your arm
Double leg, arm, supreme head some fled from the bloodshed
Painting many in red, leavin Iranians dead
Chief in me in head , hangin fast on they deathbed
Out the window, lyrics flow like hot chemicals
Burning competitors, from they ears to they asshole
You wanna battle, I separate your Adam's apple
Crack your skully with a Snapple bottle, on the Apollo
Can you read black, ease back, we bleed tracks
Breeze through facts, contacts smack your wolfpack


Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs
Brothers want grub gotta take it in blood
Because is you down or are you down just because?
Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs


Hold your satellite son, I'm from where you from
Same shit different slum, where we about to go
Ain't no need for the gun, I treat you to a slice
When we done, and all minds are one, men from the Sun



 Yo butter butter
 Protect Ya Neck baby
 Respect due pa
 Peace
 Peace
 Word up Wu-Tang in the house though


I guess alot of people in ya
I guess they can feel the realness you
They could feel the vibe
And I think hip hop, that's what I be tellin a lot of people
Alot of record promoters and alot of artists
I mean it's like, it's music that you gotta touch and feel
You know what I'm sayin'
And I think that comes across well in the video
I haven't seen you live yet, I'm waitin for the chance
But I'm pretty sure that's probaly what's it like
You know you probaly really get into it
I guess I hear it in your voices when you sayin the rhymes
Um, what ya say ya style is?


It's a secret! Never teach the Wu-Tang







All the children come into the light...
 There will be...


Rock-a-bye baby from the rooftop
When the guns blow, your cradle gets rocked
When the Earth quakes and the sky starts to fall
Down will come MCs, fake shit and all


Off top it be the sure shot, the bomb drops
Aftershock blow your bumba claat to smithereens
Time stop, flying guillotines coming for your slot
What you mean you spilled the beans, ock
Blacked out and thought I seen Pac, laser beam Glock
What's a bird to a brother with a flock, what?
They got some nerve to even try to shit a turd
On John J, slap a nigga gay with the wordplay
Hot Nix shoot you with the gift, it's your birthday
God hating ugly in the worst way, fuck 'em like the Earth say
From first day I survey the hassle, death knocking at your door
In the Big Apple, Meth rotten to the core
Shackle in the sound castle
The dungeon with vermin in the form of MCs determined
To step foot on God's soil, not knowing that
These eggheads come hard boiled and heavy handed
The aliens they just landed and you in the way
Overthrow these niggas' planet, Independence Day
Felons, get split melons, homicide
Bug niggas get the bug repellent, insecticide
Johnny 5 take it worldwide, as long as I
Pledge allegiance to the Dark Side, I'll never die
Who you know with a flow like this? Bring 'em in
What Clan you know blow like this? Bring 'em in
Take that nigga


The sound of gun burst put the foul in the dirt
(Foul in this dirt)
You can't think clearly from the mind control theory
(Mind control theory)
Murder in the first bring 'em back down to Earth
(Back down to Earth)
Y'all niggas don't hear me prepare for the worst
(Prepare for the worst)


Times gon' change, nothing will remain the same
Million dollar broke niggas still fucked up in the game
Make me wanna choke niggas shitting on my name
Tuck your chain when I approach nigga, go against the grain now
Niggas stand in rain now, die hard fan
Call me John John McClain now, Snake vs. the Crane Style
Death to the enemy, Wu brother Number One
The Centipede, troublesome, send 'em all to Kingdom Come
Sun still shine one, time for your crooked mind
Drunk off a cheap wine, son I'm into street crime
Every word, every line, got juice very fine
Turn me loose on mankind, detonate the landmine
Focus my goal now, never sell, never sold
Live by the code now, never tell, never told
Darts I throw like Clyde with the finger roll
Clutch shots and what not, this is where the buck stops
Still can't eat and y'all still can't sleep
I elect myself as Presidential MC
Wu-Tang Killa Bee, the beehive facility
In love with the blunt smoke even though it's killing me
Bad vibes filling me with thoughts of conspiracy
White Water scandals with Bill Clinton/Hillary
Too hot to handle, too well put together to dismantle
Fucker, you heard me


Excuse me as I kiss the sky
Catch me when I fall son, I'm too young to die
Me and Lefty, that be the Eye come test me
If you don't know, you never know me
Booster, burn me






I got 360 degrees of self
That's mind, body and spirit
A hundred twenty degrees a piece
We gon' break it down into simple terms
That's nine nigga nine, highest level of change
It's too many niggas sitting on their ass
Waiting for shit to just happen
Shit don't just happen, gonna fuck around a miss a buck
If you take away the negative, make room for the positive
That's adding and subtracting on the real
Niggas better learn their math
Cause if my calculations serve me correct
I'ma fuck around and have all this shit
I'm on your ass nigga






What that nigga want, God?
Word up, look out for the cops though
Wu-Tang five finger shit
Cash rules-
Word up, two for fives over here, baby
Word up, two for fives, niggas got garbage down the way, word up, know what I'm sayin'?
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. get-
Yeah, check this old fly shit out, word up
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all
Take you on a natural joint
Here we here we go, check this shit, yo


I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I be gettin' the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this, son
Rollin' with this one and that one
Pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smokin' woolas at 16
And runnin' up in gates, and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
Catchin' keys from 'cross seas
Rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo, nigga, respect mine, or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-POW! Move from the gate now!


Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all


It's been twenty-two long hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask: what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
And ain't tryin' to hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic


Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all


Niggas got to do what they got to do
To get through, know what I'm sayin'?
Because you can't just get by no more
Word up, you gotta get over, straight up and down


Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all






What that nigga want, God?

El dinero manda sobre todo a mi alrededor, Cream consigue el dinero
Billetes de dlar para todos



Crec en el lado del crimen, el lado del New York Times
Sobrevivir no era un broma
Tena segundas manos, Mama rechaz al hombre viejo
As que nos mudamos a la tierra Shaolin
Una joven jueventud, meneando el diente de oro, Polo, Goose
La nica manera de conseguir "G off" era la droga
Y vamos a empezar as hijo, yendo con este y con ese
Apretando gatillos por diversion
Pero solo era un sueo de un adolescente que era un diablo
Empec a fumar "woolas" a los 16
Enfrentndome a puertas, y dando golpes por altas inversiones
Haciendo mi camino por salidas de incendios
Sin duda "speedara" por crack y hierba
La combinacin me hizo sangrar los ojos
Sin duda proveera e intentara conseguir toda la pasta
Atracando a chavales blancos en canchas de baloncesto
Mi vida no iba a mejor, el mismo maldito polo
Los tiempos son speros y duros como el cuero
Comprend que haba ido por la ruta incorrecta
As que me hice con locura de panda y sal
Pillando kilos atravs de mares
Dando vueltas en MPV's cada semana ganbamos 40 G's
Hey nigga, respeta lo mo o aqu va el TEC-9
Ch-Chick-POW, muvete por la puerta ahora

 x2



Han sido veintids largos duros aos de seguir en apuros
La supervivencia me tena nervioso, pero estoy vivo a la llegada
Echo un vistazo a la forma de las calles
Y me mantengo despierto para los caminos del mundo porque la mierda es profunda
Un hombre con un sueo, con planes de hacer "cream"
Que fall; fui a la crcel a los 15 aos
Un joven chaval vendiendo drogas y tal, que nunca tuvo mucho
Intentando coger un pedazo de lo que no poda (tocar)
El tribunal me la jug corto, ahora me las veo con el encarcelamiento
Paseando, yendo arriba es mi destino
Esposado en la parte de atrs de un bus, cuarenta de nosotros
La vida de un cro no debera ser tan dura
Pero mientras el mundo giraba aprend que la vida es un infierno
Viviendo en el mundo no diferente a una celda
Cada da escapo de "Jakes" persiguiendo, vendiendo base
Fumando "bones" en la escalera
Aunque no s por qu elijo fumar hierba
Supongo que es el momento en el que no estoy deprimido
Pero sigo deprimido y pregunto para qu vale?
Preparado para rendirme y ver la vieja tierra
Quien explic que trabajar duro puede ayudarte a mantenerte
Para aprender a vencer a la pena y el dolor
Tenemos nios atracadores, policas corruptos, y rocas de crack y
Balas perdidas, todo en el bloque que se mantiene caliente
Djamelo a mi mientras soy prueba viviente
Para ensear la verdad a la joven negra juventud
Pero los cros corriendo salvajes, fumando hierba, bebiendo cerveza
Y sin intentar or lo que les pongo en sus odos
Ignorado por ahora, pero yo, tiene que ser aceptado
El qu? Que la vida es agitada






What you think I'm a fucking worm like you?
I told you, man, I told you, don't fuck with me
I told you, no fucking kids, no, but you wouldn't listen
Well, you stupid fuck, look at you now {Ya'll already know!}
(For real, ya'll, back behind the wall again) {yeah, you know what it is}
(You know what it do, '09 style this time) {It's time to go in now, ya'll}
(For real, making CREAM again, nigga... BLAOW!) {you already know, it's crunch time}


First of all, black park it, guns, we spark it
Hit you in the back of your dome, from far, kid
Dice kickers, gun clickers, run up in the bank for ones, quick
The drug dealer niggas, we flip 'em
Polo rugbies, flags on my hats, you love these
Knockout artists are one-piece
Fly in a foreign, all my money ties is tied-up
I'd rather sell coke, no bargain
Tough like a Hummer, fly like a Maybach
Spot runner, clap you in a gun shop, one up
Fuck about police, we Park Hillians with gold geese
And everyday's a Sunday Easter
Cousins in Gaza, the new improved Shottas
Stretched out, mink on the floor, you hassa
We run through with turbans, diamonded up chain with boots on
Mori umbrellas in Tucson
Rhyming is a color, the lifestyle is live, my fly brothers
Something go wrong, we slug something


Chill my nigga, chill (I got this, I got this)
Make sure you handle that beat, you know what time it is
Body that beat, man, come on (Yeah)


You can catch me anywhere, frost bitten chain
Bad dame, a thousand grams in Delaware
The smokeshop's is owls, laid back, hanging niggas to death
Word, you can call us coat racks
With 'giants' all around me like, Eli Manning
The bitch is on the block like, he died scrambling
Cuz L frames is crack, popped out, nina one of his eyes
Can't come back home, they locked out
All he did was re-up, hustle for kick money
Kept Beez all around him, thinking he shit honey
Bow, I'm into bobsleds, wasting large bread
Gucci helmet is blue, trim in his dark red
The rap TJ Swan, it's me Ason
If he don't spin my shit, break the DJ arm
And glide off like an escapade, renegade on ice
Lemonade Clark, the haze is nice
The Goldielocks, rocks sapphire, chain is right
Bitch niggas, ya'll watch what ya'll say in ya mics, suckas


Aiyo, Rae, aiyo, Rae, check it out, yo
Let me go in there one more time and air these niggas out
For old times sake, you know how we do, my nig'
Old times sake, just for me, man, one more time, I'm begging you
Let me just go in, and just fly on these niggas heads, man
It's what I'm talking about


It's like a body in a project hallway, who did it?
Who's the next nigga that sucked the snit-ich
That's my word, it could never be me
You see the deer head on the living room wall, like his neck fell off
That can be all sculptured and glazed with gloss
Call the shots that Bill Belichick would call
Snake niggas slither all in the glass house, racial slurs
When it's time to go to war, they cash out
Throw 'em in the rear-naked choke, they tap out
Niggas try to surround the kid, I backed out
And threw two rocks at 'em, watching the ho drop
I'm from a place where we locking the low Glocks
Yellowtape, the bodies, jiggy and road blocks
Got the towels up in the air, it's so hot
Talking bout Staten Island, profiling
Switchblade city, the goons is wilding
Escape from my slums, nigga, you got talent
And we don't want the fifth of 'yac, we want the gallon


What you think I'm a fucking worm like you?
I told you, man ---


Vacate black, bust gats, wherever we at
You all that, hit 'em in the chest, we fall back
I got mines, nigga, where yours at?
We call that, raw rap, got fiends in front of my door mat
That Witty Unpredictable fly shit, drive-by shit
These the niggas I ride with
And we gon' get cake, ya'll, as soon as this pie split
Smacking up the dry snitch, nigga, you my bitch
Somebody put Tical on, matter fact, put Tical on
One suuu, Staten Isle on 'em
I bank roll, I break codes, and I ain't trynna catch another case, case closed
Give me my crown, cuz I deserve it, real dudes giving me pounds
But not too close though, the semis'll round
Bitches, running they mouth, goons, running your gate
My team running the block, cops running my plates
Well fuck that, Criminology rap
Niggas hate, I hate back, floating in the flyest Maybach, nigga




Ooooh! We have returned
Yeah, show you how to flow again (show you how to flow again)
It's the rap rule again (hehehehe) Yo, yo..

 (Method Man)
Street, Meth, we ride like A.C. and O.J. (y'all niggas crazy!)
I runs up on you in broad days, I'm a Loose Link
I carry's the Heaterz, always
Small timers, get left for dead in the hallways
It's that ill breed, move in warp speed, follow my lead
(Me and my Co-D's, about to O.D.) let me procede
I'm that O.G., you're not in my league (you know my steez)
I put the smackdown, on you killer clown M.C.'s

 (Streetlife)
I rock for all my niggas (I rock for all my niggas)
That's why I hurt to be here, okay, let me see here
Stat' Land, crooked letter is I, we back, man
Harder than a dick on viagra gettin' a lap dance
Hittin' like a back hand (I slap y'all kids)
As if we in a game of spades, and y'all renig'
John Blaze, not the clothing, cuz some of that is slum
(Son, I'm already knowin') cut they jeans mad young


In the Crooked Letter-I, it's do or die
Shit, every man fights to stay alive
In the Crooked Letter-I, you should not try
Meth Tical, Streetlife, Killa Bee, why..

 (Streetlife)
Stingy with my dough, even stingier with dojia'
(Told y'all) You'll never go broke, long as I yo'ya
Maintain your composure, or party over
For stank bitches, who get it, twisted like yoga
Holla for a dollar, yea, and y'all ain't gotta go home
(But y'all gotta get the fuck outta here)
Who stay "Lo" like Jennifer, won't see me a lot
But when you see Vivica, tell her she a "Fox"

 (Method Man)
We rollin', big truck, sittin' on chrome (twistin' a bone)
Talkin' to a bird on the bat phone
Zonin', out the area, roamin'
The closest you could come to my style, maybe, is clonin'
The omen (I'm warnin' you now!) Niggas is holdin'
Run up, watch me put one up in your colon
Chizzle town, thugs in the club, like chicks posin'
Lambchop niggas is sheep in wolf clothing



 (Method Man)
Beware, danger, shoot off your flares
Warn all your dogs (tell 'em we here)
The Stat' (we don't bust our guns in the air)
Never that, y'all don't come out til the coast is clear
(Who you suppose to fear) Street, I fears no one
You all thumbs, I probably murder you with your gun
When I start lettin' off (niggas is jettin' off)
You straight chicken broth, we holes in your terrycloth


Double O, 3, long time no see
Who mind parts seas, and cause blind to see
Some think this industry is just all rhyme and G
Then he make it to the door, and he can't find the key
Don't know what it be, to make y'all follow my lead
Or make this pretty thing on her knees swallow my seed
If rap wasn't rap no more, what would it be
I don't know, I'd be zonin' sometime, must be the weed... that's that shit




Yeah, Homicide Housing, Loose Linx
Carlton Fisk, D.C., rest in peace
To the Million Dollar Kid, Y
(S.I., N.Y., 10304) Sick eyes, Size 7
Big Nut, what up (Big up to Denaun, good lookin' on the track, nigga
Matter fact, I'mma call Staten Island the tri-borough, now on
Cuz we'll "tri" any fuckin' thing) Homicide Housing..
(Fuck y'all)




Its lights, camera, action, run it and still rappin
Lyrical tornado, twister, Bill Paxton
On two E pills, three vics and six aspirin
This bulls running plays on the court like Phil Jackson
I am mad raw, fucker, better back off
Punch line pros, we leaving you with a cracked jaw
Down in MIA sniffing on some bath salts
Eat your fucking face off and spit it on the asphalt
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Call up Rick Grimes and aim for the head and shoot at least six times
Connecticut to Shaolin, show em what the bounce is
Coming with that fire so you better bring an ounce, kid
Its that motherfucker fucking panty stuffer, listen to the real cant stand the others
Cop a lethal weapon like Danny Glover
Walk into the woods bust rounds at Bambis mother, uh


Live and let die, I get it like I spit it, we ride like an AMG, get it? G5
Five, Michael in it, got the key to the city
We vibe, no commercial interruptions, we live
Warning, see now that you have entered the zone
Professionals at work, do not attempt this at home
All I needs a verse and a minute when its on
Ill be begging like a convict for minutes on the phone
Up until they throw me in a box, or catch me in the trap, trying to throw away the rock
Im a product of the block, a hustler, the product in the socks
Serve a customer, regardless of the cops
Regardless of the guap, still a legend
On fire, cause Im hot, yall are sweating, still denying that Im not
In fact, Webby, Im like the overweight lover, Im that heavy
Minus the frames and fat belly


Thanks for that Meth, we do this man you know
CT to Shaolin, C. Webby to John Blaze
Its just that hip hop shit, you know, its that
That raw emotion that you get when you get behind this mic, like you know?


Suburban rap savior's back, slay it when I lay a track
The fourth Animaniac, the Timothy McVeigh of rap
They so concerned with swag that they forgot about the basics
Thats some shit I cant respect, Ill never hold my tongue or take it back
This is art, this is true, this is all I know
The only time I feel at peace is when I start to flow
I dont care if the masses think that my shits hot
Cause this is raw, this is me, this is hip hop




And I say one for the money, 3 for the show (roll up)
Because we know that all the bad bitches smoke (vibe wit me)
You competition is past fictional
Gettin stopped like a bad pick and roll, magnifico
These niggas is getting old, my team too strong
Kevin knows, take you out your zone, I'm the new don
And the only polo I know is Ralph Lauren
Put me on the court with the opposition - I'll outscore 'em (easy)


Try not to use cash so my checks serve a purpose
Every time I sign for a blessing I use my cursive
Got scruffs on my Timbs for a dollar so it was worth it
Cocaine white suits, see an angel before we murk him
Hog for the work, niggas' eyes love to lurk
I got a bitch named cal, she 'bout 40 and love to twerk
Nothing changed, range aiming at your frame, nigga
Ain't a clause when dear to reign get you slain nigga


Prices turnover the code like da Vinci, no nigga tempt me
Generational curse of chugging whiskey 'til it was empty
Drive-bys out the four-door Honda, dreams of a Bentley
Pockets full of dead white men, I pray the master don't lynch me
Step your game up - You wifed her, she been a rat
I text her at the crack of dawn, tap-tap it and send her back
My granny, momma, sister, cousin bedroom was up in that trap
Is them drugs up on my counter? "No momma, that's Similac"


Yo, I just spent like 30k today, I ain't gon' front
See I came up from the bottom, I'mma get everything I want
See the homies, I'mma holla, nothing changed I rolled a blunt
Told 'em now it's time to eat cause we've been starving days and months
And it's a must that we can trust nobody but us
We ready to bust if enemies come
But I can realize that this this ain't what you want
See I do this shit for fun, screaming HS87 'til I'm done
Ha, now I'm done


Stop the beat, here comes the starter
Grab your popcorn, grab your water
Grab your daughter, cause she watching cause I start like Mr. Carter
Say I'm ballin' like a man, finger on the trigger
Got money all in my pocket, I'm a I-E nigga
Name Oktane, that nigga Oktane to be exact
You hope to hear from a real nigga one day, well this is that
I got that crack and I got that X R E, AK
And I got my back, Tony Montana give em that brrrat
HS87 nigga that's that, I'm done


No need for me to getting involved
You'll get hit with a bat and wrapped in a cloth
Uh, razor blades, shanks and fades
Everybody on the floor or they K'd
Uh, my young gliggity-Glock got on my crotch
Stay ready and cocked
Can't wrap me in a bag, I'm going pop
New Rollie, so heavy metal
Want a rock? Gotta hustle nonstop


Look, wash yo hands before you shake mine
You was talking shit I heard it through the grapevine
Yeah, it's a lot of boppers on the sideline
So the young baller had to go baseline
I'm a black nigga with money like Akon
You mad the squad winning that's a hate crime
Peas and carrots, live and grow, that's my day job
Young Veggie attract hoes like a Drake song


California, Christopher Dorner manifesto
Hit-Boy, hip-hop I started on the metro
But now I'm in that retro, Ferrari two-seater
With the pedal to the floor, got it singing like Aretha
If you scared, get a dog or a preacher
Hit the hot spot with a bitch resembling Mona Lisa
Priceless, I'm righteous, I walk the talk
I am cooked cocaine, you are softer than chalk
Cause your bite ain't as bad as your bark
After dark, you inside like an embryo - I swim with the sharks
Cause when I smell blood in the water
I'm taking over like the New World Order, witness the gangland slaughter
Bitch


(Maybach Music)
Still sipping Ros back seat of the Rolls
Kilos on the Cuban link, they thought it was Hov's
Fascinated with gold, sneakers and talented hoes
Before you get to cruise you paddle the boat
Elevated to elevators, had to walk flights
Young niggas lick shots for them Air Nikes


Ride with me, although the driver's tipsy
Avoid them officers calling 50s to get me
They call me talk of the city, never talk the jiggy, man
I'd rather talk to Whitney, condolences to Bobbi Krissy
Balling I'm forreal, I got NBA skill
Make you feel a little scrappy with the Stevie J grill
And y'all ain't gotta ask me if it's Homicide Hill, nah
Don't even ask me - this is Homicide Hill


I'm from the era of Biggie Smalls, TLC's "Waterfalls"
Buying dimebags by the mini-mall
I got your whole city logged online
Disrespect mine, I be throwing ones like a titty bar
You fucking with a grown man, boy
I plug two like Trugoy, send that memo on your Android
For 10G, you can talk to the boss
My experience, I'm like Jordan on the court, nigga


Pyrex pots and Guess shorts
Yo, weed flow is the best sport
Now I'm underwater flipping quarters
The code to go tackle the globe
Black Mac in the robe
Metal mag cold straps, shit is gold
Partyville and Hennessy fiend
I'm blessed, it was a dream
He had his team moving tight like skinny jeans
You know, by any means
We will bring the magazines out and clap everything down like little geeses
All ride with ninas, cooling in cuisines
Yo the whores is giving top in the back, I ordered wings
Spray shit up to smithereens
Stepping off they sway shit
Shake your hand, blow you head up in killa Queens
Yo, the dons know what it do
I'm just that fly in the interview
Wintertime grinding it seems
Remember the pledge of allegiance
To the team with more reasons, more firepower, and more squeezes




A game of chess is like a swordfight:
You must think first before you move
Toad style is immensely strong
And immune to nearly any weapon
When it's properly used it's almost invincible


Raw I'ma give it to ya, with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
Like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MC's approach with slang that's dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushin' force, my force you're doubtin'
I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains


Well, I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary and carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum, and the isle I'm from
Is comin' through with nuff niggas and nuff guns
So if you wanna come sweatin', stressin', contestin'
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk
I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain, there's no way to barricade me
Steamrollin' niggas like an 18 wheeler
With a drunk driver drivin', there's no survivin'


Rough like Timberland wear, yeah
Me and the Clan in 'Yota Landcruisers out there
Peace to all the crooks, all the niggas with bad looks
Bald heads, braids, blow this hook
We pack chrome TEC's, nickel-plated MAC's
Black AC's, drug-dealin' styles in phat stacks
I only been a good nigga for a minute though
'Cause I got to get my props and win it, yo
I got beef with commercial-ass niggas with gold teeth
Lampin' in a Lexus, eatin' beef
Straight up and down, don't even bother
I got 40 niggas up in here now who kill niggas' fathers


My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Bees on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats


Here I go, deep type flow
Jacques Cousteau could never get this low
I'm cherry bombin' shits BOOM!
Just warmin' up a little bit, vroom vroom
Rappinin' is what's happenin'
Keep the pockets stacked and then, hands clap and then
At the party when I move my body
Gotta get up and be somebody!
Grab the microphone, put strength to the bone
DUH DUH DUHenter the Wu-Tang zone
Sure enough when I rock that stuff
Huff? Puff? I'm gonna catch your bluff tuff
Rough, kickin' rhymes like Jim Kelly
Or Alex Haley, I'm a Mi-Beetle Bailey rhymes
Comin' raw style, hardcore
Niggas be comin' to the hip-hop store
Comin' to buy grocery from me
Tryin' to be a hip-hop MC
The law, in order to enter the Wu-Tang
You must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang
Represent the GZA, Abbot
RZA, Shaquan, Inspectah Deck
Dirty Ol' gettin' low with his flow
Introducin' the Ghostface Killah
No one could get iller


My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats


Speakin' of the Devil, psych!
No, it's the God, get the shit right
Mega trife, and yo, I killed you in a past life
On the mic while you was kickin' that fast shit
You reneged, tried again and got blasted
Half-mastered-ass style, mad ruff task
When I struck I had on Timbs and a black mask
Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack
That night, yo, I was hittin' like a spiked bat
And then you thought I was bugged out, and crazy
Strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy
Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs
Never shot thugs, I'm runnin' with thugs that flood mugs
So, grab your 8 plus 1
Start flippin' and trippin', niggas is jettin', I'm lickin' off, son


Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang!


Homicide's is legal and death is the penalty
One justifies the homicide when he dies in his own iniquity?
It's the master of the Mantis Rapture comin' at ya
We have an APB on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a master
Evidence indicates that his stature
Merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
The flow changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like a lie, paralyzin' the victim
You scream as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Movin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
And injure any motherfuckin' contender


My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats




Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know the deal, nigga
Sha what's good nigga?
Lex Diamond, your big brother here, you know
Let's work this shit out, man
Yeah, yeah, yeah, aiyo, aiyo


Fresh out the jungle where the blue boys run
We carry rugers, smoking toast on your throat like oolas
Hitting reefer, playing my square, windbreaker jacket
Holding my bear, rock and roll in my lear
I have to eat, gun carefully, let the cocaine bling
Strings is nothing, get your ho clapped, king
We hundred burners, onion turners, all this, came out the yard
With twenty five to lifers, loving my squad
You know the gun show off, whips is gleaming, clean as a fuck
In dirty hallways, the ninas'll cluck
This is crime station, my obligation is to look raw as ever
Feed my little sons and patients
Cuz they hungry, shining, bullet fly right through the lining
Catch me on the plane, humble and wining
Feeding me, fresh niggas, downtown, Brooklyn in them brook lands
Is Timbed up, looking for them jookes, with my miss and


Yo, the streets is a part of me
What you witnessing now is don archery
Pack a lambskin hostler, one of these rocks'll soft you over
You ain't nothing, you'se a bitch ass poser
Fiends on your face, on the T-shirt, thinking that you envy the P
Underneath'll be R.I.P
That's what you get, yo, for being so cocky
Two guns, thumbs up, for me and my posse


Yo, what's the science, little nigga? Yo, you beefing too hard
I throw five in your Champ hood, and envy your squad
You try to stick out your fucking hand, nah, I don't want no dap, nigga
Fucking lucky you ain't get glammed
Bitch ass nigga, you wrong, yo, you mingle with rats
The other day you got caught with the gat, nigga
How you home, nigga? Why you even up in my square?
Like you get busy, got the block hot and stare
Fresh coffins fast, they spitting, ya'll fake bitches
Snitches get mad love, hundred and eight stitches
My condolences, word life, if they can find you a real killa
Someone close is singing like the Jonases
Crime Stoppers, the tips keep pouring in
For a G, you be suprised who's going in
Block huggers, the ones who be holding they jock
And suck my cock, the real cock lovers




Ya'll can call me cook up or come back
My flow hot, my hood hot, cuz of one rat
My block on fire cuz of one match
I spit with paper like thumbstacks, these cougars wanna play all these
Young cats
With pussy, turning boys to men, so I resort to the pen
But at the same time, I'm pointing the pen
And now it's game time, nigga, you in? You better thicken your skin
Move with your peoples through the thick and the thin
I watch for po-po, they raiding the crib
And I ain't trying to get jammed, and have the next man raising my kids
God forbid, dudes be hating on his, because a nigga go hard
And hit 'em harder then they saying they is
But that's just New York, I carry the torch, just long enough
To light a Newport and carry this thought
Fuck what you thought, the bigger the boss, bigger the cost
They don't know about the Tribe of Shabazz, niggas is lost





Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo, yo, yo
All them real live motherfuckin' niggas
Step up front right now, it's goin' down
One love to Long Island, Hempstead in my heart, baby
Shaolin what? Come on, come on

Dangerous ground, tre pound, seven spin around
For my bredren the clouds come down
War and peace, I take it to the street
Land shark on my lawn, chop the thumbs off a thief
And curse his first born, is this thing on?
Send 'em to the children of the corn we the people

See, niggas through the eye of the Demon
My lethal injection, destroyin' evil
Hot Nikkel, private eye, one pistol
Aimin' at your brain tissue, do or die

Said the spider to the fly, "Could this one be tasty?"
Like momma apple pie goodness, Johnny Blaze me
On the job like Dick Tracy
Hit the cure for that ill shit like Ben Casey, M.D

Symbolic thrill like God he shocked it
Like a finger in a light socket
Too good to be forgotten, in the rotten apple
I kick dirt on your sand castle, check the flavor all natural

(Beat your feet)
Hot Niks, son
(Heat-mizer)
Before you get the main course
(Taste a appetizer)

Submerged in the word
Heavy headed verbal that smack you
Mentally disturb you, attack you
Thirty-six chamb' once again comin' at you
Young gun got the body snatch you observe

Wise words you can only see through the third
I fall way beyond the norm on the verb
Shine on mental nourishment, you can dine on
Track yellin' at me, "Get yo , God"

 is hard, regardless to whom or what
They all movin' targets, Allah
Runnin' through your house and your block party, with rap shotty
And hot rock the body body, St. Bernards

Couldn't save your entourage, rap lobotomy
Leave ya mentally scarred, numb and possibly
Dumb deaf and blind, is it?
I kick the spine out the battery backs
Fuckin' with mine, keep it movin'

Now, everybody just throw your hands in the
What the fuck? Peace, who this?

Mind detect mind, I P.L.O. your startin' line, deep Space Nine
Designed for knuckleheads who bust guns and throw signs
Let's converse, snatch the tap from your purse
Body-surf on the verse head first

Peep defeat, bitch Street beat you down with the heat
And you spazzed out spittin' out teeth ain't nuttin' peace
Big boys don't destroy blunted zone pop steroid
50 men convoy, expensive where's the big toy

Rumble through the wasteland right hand's on the silencer
40 caliber city slicker Staten Islander
Synchronized minds combine thoughts that motivate
Don't perpetrate, pass the blunt let it circulate

Street politicians on a suicide mission
Crime vision finger itchin' from a scope-view position
Dangerous ground, tre pound, seven spin around
For my bredren the cloud comes down

Keep your eyes open, love potion
Number nine poetry in motion
Knowledge me the seventh sign
Scopin', connivin', infiltrate is most of mine
Play 'em nonchalantly, calmly expose the nine

Push and get shoved what the fuck God's thinkin' of?
Comin' in the club wit that screw face, actin' up
Is we men or mice? Bad moon risin', we wild for the night
Kill a skitzofrenic, nigga twice 'cuz O
That's what happened when frontin' on the Shaol' borough

Island of Staten we in here no fear, assault wit intent
To kill your whole regiment 
Startin' wit yo president, duckin' my dart gun
Tear apart, son, you don't want it then don't start none

Blaze one with Jonathon, part man, part fly
Handle my B-I camouflage like G.I
Fat like Joe, a day in the life
Your money or your life that's the life
Everybody can't afford ice in the struggle
Tryin' to eat right another day another hustle, hustle, hustle

Dangerous ground, tre pound, seven spin around
For my bredren the clouds come down
War and peace, I take it to the street
Land shark on my lawn, chop the thumbs off a thief, motherfucker




Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yea yo
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo
All them real live motherfuckin niggas step up front right now
It's goin down
One love to Long Island Hempstead in my heart baby
Shaolin what?
Come on, come on, HA!


Dangerous ground
Tre pound seven spin around for my brethren the clouds come down
War and peace, I take it to the street
Land shark on my lawn chop the thumbs off a thief
And curse his first born, is this thing on?
Send 'em to the children of the corn we the people
See, niggas through the eye of the demon
My lethal injection, destroyin evil
Hot Nikkel what, private eye one pistol
Aiming at your brain tissue, do or die
Said the spider to the fly, "Could this one be tasty?"
Like momma apple pie goodness, Johnny Blaze me
On the job like Dick Tracy
Hit the cure for that ill shit like Ben Casey, M.D
Symbolic thrill like god he shocked it
Like a finger in a light socket, too good to be forgotten
In the rotten apple
I kick dirt on your sand castle
Check the flavor all natural


(Beat your feet)
Hot Niks son
(Heat-mizer)
Before you get the main course
(Taste a appetizer)


Submerged in the word
Heavy headed verbal that smack you
Mentally disturb you, attack you
Thirty-six chamb' once again comin at you
Young gun got the body snatch you observe
Wise words you can only see through the third
I fall way beyond the norm on the verb
Shine on mental nourishment, you can dine on
Track yellin at me get yo arrow god
Victory is hard, regardless to whom or what
They all movin targets Allah
Runnin through your house and your block party, with rap shotty
And hot rock the body body, St. Bernards
Couldn't save your entourage, rap lobotomy
Leave ya mentally scarred, numb and possibly
Dumb deaf and blind is it
I kick the spine out the battery backs
Fuckin with mine keep it movin


Now everybody just throw your hands in the......(phone rings)
What the fuck?
Peace - who this?


Mind detect mind, I P.L.O. your startin line
Deep Space Nine
Designed for knuckleheads who bust guns and throw signs
Let's converse snatch the tap from your purse
Body-surf on the verse head first
Peep defeat, bitch Street beat you down with the heat
And you spazzed out spittin out teeth ain't nothing peace
Big boys don't destroy blunted zone pop steroid
50 men convoy, expensive where's the big toy
Rumble through the wasteland right hand's on the silencer
40 caliber city slicker Staten Islander
Synchronized minds combine thoughts that motivate
Don't perpetrate pass the blunt let it circulate
Street politicians on a suicide mission
Crime vision finger itching from a scope-view position
Dangerous ground
Tre' pound seven spin around for my brethren the cloud comes down


Yo, keep your eyes open
Love potion number nine poetry in motion
Knowledge me the seventh sign
Scopin, connivin, infiltrate is most of mine
Play 'em nonchalantly, calmly expose the nine
Push and get shoved what the fuck Gods thinkin of
Comin in the club wit that screwface, actin up
Is we men or mice, bad moon risin
We wild for the night
Kill a schizophrenic nigga twice cuz-o
That's what happened when frontin on the Shaol' borough
Island of Staten we in here no fear
Assault wit intent
To kill your whole regiment it's real
Startin wit yo president, duckin my dart gun
Tear apart son - you don't want it then don't start none
Blaze one with Jonathon, part man part fly
Handle my B-I camouflage like G.I
Fat like Joe, a day in the life
Your money or your life that's the life
Everybody can't afford ice in the struggle
Tryin to eat right another day another hustle hustle hustle
(Uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh)
Dangerous ground tre' pound seven spin around
For my brethren the clouds come down
War and peace, I take it to the street
Land shark on my lawn chop the thumbs off a thief
Motherfucker




Yessir, Red and Meth in the muthafucking building, nigga
Yeah... yeah.. ya'll already know the muthafucking business, nigga
Agh, let's go, yo check it


Yo, you can, find me up inside a whore
Making her legs go up like Ferrari doors
Gilla House get 'Chips A'Hoy', don't sniff the boy
But I'm naughty like Tommy Boy
Go back like Atari cords, still here, shit
Superman ended up in a wheelchair
I'm fresh like Bel-Air, I paid my dues
And you trying to be cool up in Sunday school
Can't move when I flow, bet a nigga gonna copy
Take it home, study it, then he gon' profit
In the rap game, every nigga gonna gossip
Even Herbie Hancock know Red rock it
Yo, Red, stop it, time is up
Only nigga that's fly on the rhyme is us
Cuz, no one can stop me
Da-da-na, da-da-na, like Rocky


Aiyo, this how it sound when them boys underground
Nigga, check our style, we some {Dangerous M.C.'s}
(Game over, forget 'em, forget 'em, forgot 'em)
(Game over, forget 'em, forget 'em, forget 'em) {Dangerous MC's}


Yo, back when chef mami used to sell plates, we used to sell base
I learned to wipe my nose and wipe the prints off the shell case
Don't want no jail case, freedom miles standing at hell's gate
It's hot, and the devil's my cell mate
The game's addictive, I can't stop, it's like I'm chasing that first high
Like Betty Crocker baking that first pie
The beef we serving is stir fried, swerving all through your urban
Hurting, every gate and corner, you working, I'm
The bottom line, the school of hard knocks turn into Columbine
And my set is throwing up dollar signs
Some get gwop, some get pop, me?
I got a ziplock of bubble gum, just for selling Chris Rock
Nobody move, nobody shot, Meth, I'm in the body shop
Where you rummy, rolling your body drops
I'm trynna stand on my own two, get signed to a major
Be a franchise player and get my own shoe






Oh my god, oh my god!
Aaaow! (Boo!)
Uh, uh, yo, uh


Microphone checka, swingin' sword lecture
Closin' down the sector, supreme neck protector
Better warn 'em kid, Mr. Meth's a boiling pot
About to blow his lid from the pressure, too hot for TV
For sheesy, too many wanna be hard be easy
It's all N'together, going all out together
It don't take much to please me
Still homes I'm never satisfied like the Stones
We don't condone bitin' see them skull and crossbones
Protecting what I'm writing
Don't clash with the Titan who blast with a license
To kill rap reciting
Come on, in the zone with ya nigga from the Group Home TICAL (Fuck your lifestyle!)
Put your lights out
Get the shit to crackin' got you fiending with your pipes out
Time for some action
Surfin' the avenue, mad at you, where I used to battle crews
Back when Antoinette had that attitude
Cover me I'm going in, walls closing in
Got us bustin' off these pistols, my niggas got issues
Again, same song armed with the mega bomb
Blow you out the frame and then I'm gone


Yo, I was going 2 buck we roam, cellular phones
Doc-Meth back in the flesh, blood and bones
Don't condone, spend bank loans on homegrown
Suckers break like Turbo and Ozone
When I, grab the broom
Moon-walk platoon hawk my goons bark
Leave you in a blue lagoon lost (true)
Three nines in the glove with Masu, D-Don and The Gov'
Right behind on a bus
Haters don't touch (what?) weigh us both up
Now my neighbor doped up
Got the cable hooked up, all channels
Lift my shirt all mammal
You ship off keys and we ship Grand Pianos
Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
Sippin' on a forty, yo smokin' on a blunt
Bust my gun y'all. Red and Meth didn't jump
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, laaaaa
Yeah come on, Red and Meth didn't jump
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, laaaaa




Let's get it on Kokomo
John John Blazeini, Donna J-Bird
Yeah
Another Persian legacy

 The Iron Lung


Yo yeah
Yeah, yo, yo
Dart throwing, yo aimin at your nostril, Aeropostle
Sword rockin halibut steak we choppin
Mili-tia, eight to nine generals at one time
Fine we blend wine, go beyond one line
Spot the snakeskin, Dunn was scaley
Chopped his head off fuhrilly, sit back, crack the Bailey's
Wetter than white milk, grab the quilt - that's the heater
My nigga drop losses, strike like Adidas
Shit is deep, the Grant's still burnin
The long time earnin, just got snatched by more Germans
Europeans are seein me bleedin, jet off in
The Lex skiin, goggles, Louis Rich Sweden


I dig my life experiences, wrap it up
In twelve inches, keepin my defenses
Put it up in raw trenches, holdin court on the park benches
In the ghetto servin life sentence
Mass confusion in New York, on these city sidewalks
Busy sidewalks, there's no snoozin
Stop actin like it's me losin, peep my modern day
Pompei on city streets, the Sun pack heat
In Hell's Kitchen, time to get money finger itchin
Once again plot thicken, and you succumb
To the will of the slum bite your tongue
Burn a bush with the Iron Lung, pay dirt to no one
Guilty by association, stank bitch
Wanna give me some, nappy nasty -- I pass
Let them players flash, and trick on they cash
On your funky ass I only buy shit that last
A lifetime I write rhyme, chippin through
The pipeline then it's flight time, that's when I'm jetty
In a fifty-seven Chevy, gassed on my own Getti
Head heavy, with deadly medleys


I opened up my rap bible, then the light came
Over the children, as it began to rain
I started buildin, spoke many times before
But didn't score, my reading was poor
Injected with the Devil's english, I extinguish
And approach all hominyms, shit in your brain
Wipe my ass with the phenonmenyms, be holy
Or get shot down with the Moet-o, kid encyclopedia
Left y'all petrol, my dancehall standoff
Rap like Peter Metro, echo echo, what?
Beware my psycho, limw piece tec-o leggo
Uniform flow, stay strong black my shit is real
Peace out bro
...


Tical
Eyes as diamonds, time again
Motherfuckers wanna battle with the bat or pen
Give it to em raw, give it to em raw
Down to the fuckin floor, up to the roof with the proof
Meth-Tical mad, god damn!
Hahahaha, right
Motherfuckers

(Ihr wisst bescheid, Berlin, Meine Stadt)
Haut rein, passt auf euch auf
(Berliiin, meine Stadt, meine Stadt)
Frohe Weihnachten ihr Wichser



(Das ist AK)

(Das ist AK)


Man, Aksit on the beat y'all, brother holdin' it down


It's one team in the world and that's SWAT
E.O.T., that's Entertainment y'all
Wu, peace


Hier wird das Geld gemacht, Geld ist Macht
Ich zeige dir das Leben auf der Strae, Director's Cut
Der echte Stuff, hier wird kiloweise Crack verpackt
Hier spricht der Chef der Stadt, der Escobar
Mein Rap ist hart, mein Rap ist ein Exemplar
Du rappst zwar explizit, doch ich fick dein Arsch
Extra Large, ich mach dich extra platt
Und du kriegst extra ein Bericht im Extrablatt
Doch schei auf Extra Mextra
Hier kommt der Gangster Mangster
Mit dem Geld aus dem Raub zum Investmentbanker
Ich kenne die Straen, kenne die Blocks
Kenne die Fressen, die Fotzen, kenne die Cops
Kenne die Dealer im Benzer, die mit dem Stoff
Kenne die Konsumenten, kenne den Koch
Hier ist alles vergiftet, es werden Menschen gekidnappt
Alles ist AusserKontrolle, es ist ein steinhartes Business


Das ist AK, das ist das was du willst
Das ist noch mehr als du wolltest
Das sind zwei rappende Kings
Es ist alles AusserKontrolle, wir kontern mit Bomben
Ficken euch Fotzen, behalten die Krone (30er Zone)

Wir sind schon viel zu lange in der Scheisse drin
Doch seit "Meine Stadt" wisst ihr wer wir sind
Es ist A, Krieg, mental, flieh
Du kannst nicht mit uns ficken, Junge, Metall fliegt
Hier ist alles verdorben, niemand hat ein Gewissen
Wir mssen Waffen besorgen, um das Ott zu beschtzen
Besorg das Acid in Wedding, vertick es weiter an Ecken
Wir mssen dicke Batzen machen, soll'n doch alle verrecken
Es ist ein dreckiges Business, du zckst fr Geld an die Spitze
Ich will 22 Zoll, CL, lederne Sitze
Ich will schicki micki, Klunker Munker, ficki ficki deine Mutter
Junge komm mal wieder runter, dieser Shit ist heavy, Boy
Nichts fr schwache Nerven, nix fr kleine Kinder
Hermann macht Abitur, Serkan sitzt hinter Gittern
Das ist eine kranke Welt, Ich rufe nach Gerechtigkeit
Doch bleibe nur ein Gangster in seinem Benz in einem Wendekreis


Das ist AK, das ist das was du willst
Das ist noch mehr als du wolltest
Das sind zwei rappende Kings
Es ist alles AusserKontrolle, wir kontern mit Bomben
Ficken euch Fotzen, behalten die Krone (30er Zone)

AK ist jetzt Stereo, du und deine Jungs sind ehrenlos
Komm uns nicht auf Bruder, wir regeln schon
(Wir sind regeros, deine Mnner reden gro)
(Ich komm aus einer Gegend, wo das ??? mit dem Leben droht)
Du bist ein Junge, der in einer reichen Gegend wohnt
Ich verkauf in deiner reichen Gegend Edelkoks
(Geh mit uns, gemeinsam diesen Weg ins Tod)
(Gib uns die Waage, die Ware und wir regeln's schon)
Doch wir regeln Geschfte nie am Telefon
Denn die Bullen in meiner Gegend nehm hier fast jeden hoch
(Ich bin nicht stolz darauf, doch wir nehmen blo)
(das was die Gesellschaft uns gibt, so ist das Leben, Bro)
Draussen auf Beton Rap, gib dir den Soundtrack
A Check K Check, AK Family, wir kill'n mit der AK Enemies
Gib uns die Hennessy, wir seh'n tote Kennedys


Das ist AK, das ist das was du willst
Das ist noch mehr als du wolltest
Das sind zwei rappende Kings
Es ist alles AusserKontrolle, wir kontern mit Bomben
Ficken euch Fotzen, behalten die Krone (30er Zone)

Uh, get ya stank on

WWKYA, WE'RE KICKIN YOUR ASS!

My receitals is worth ten titles
I shit on wrote Bibles, if you don't like me I don't like you
I liable to load the rifle, hit the roof and snipe you
The shit I spit damaging your vitals
Nobody ride through like my squad do
Got all y'all players suicidal
Actin niggas, take two
You heard the news, I'ma break it to ya
We're here to headline the bill and
Featuring Funk Doc, Tical and the villain
A mic murder for hire, ten grand a killin
Yo Funk Doc, pass the Glock, this bitch nigga grillin
I make moves wit my big dog ?bounce?
Staten Island to the Bricks for mo' chips and mo' pounds
Y'all know who really lockin this shit down
When we rock it, don't we all stand out?
Y'all hazardarious, clear out
Get ya ass out 'fore I tear it out
And show you what I'm talkin 'bout


Yo get ya up and get ya high, ha!
Get ya stoned and get ya wide
Dat's dat shit (like or not, niggas sleepin wit the fifth)
Dat's dat shit (like or not, bitches fightin over dick)
Aiyyo we get ya up and get ya high (yeah)
Get ya stoned and get ya wide
Dat's dat shit (like or not, niggas sleepin wit the fifth)
Dat's dat shit (like or not, bitches fightin over dick)

I'm high-powered, the dog rott weiler
Chocolate thai showers got Doc cookin minute rice for five hours
You wet cowards, I'm live wire
Ya bitch ass probably wash ya hands wit Palmolive
Yo Bricks holler, I got the plan printed
Load it and it goes like summer jam tickets
Fam can't dig it, pop goes the wea-sel
You be hidin under your peacoat wit people
I told cops, roll blocks, no props
Fo' pops, Hennesy back and we both shot
That's how we go out, are you the thug type?
To ride down like Hopper from a Bug Life?
Watch the movie, haters tried to eye screw D
Your beef in small claims court, Judge Judy
When you and I meet up, the fight heat up
Bloody up ya wife beater then light weed up



I melt wax, Cuban Link chain react
Breezin through these tracks wit the highest of velocity
Play me like Monopoly
Pay me everytime you trespass on my property
I'm Dick Dastardly, no use in cop blockin me
Sloppily, your woman on the stop-watch clockin me
Possibly I rock well, somebody always watchin me
Livin in the street life, my eyes seen atrocity
Undress a kid properly
When I keeps it movin that means there ain't no stoppin me
Constant motivation, the god fiend bury kings
Proper education, Allah sees everything
How High, just another form of elevation
That's why I choose to build from the basement
Twelve-thirty-one-ninety-nine, times are wastin
More these Hot Dog MC's next to Nathan
Allah Math, break the phonograph in half
Promoters on some bullshit, short wit Johhny cash
(Dat's dat shit) They got snitches rattin on the click
(Dat's dat shit) They got bitches fightin over dick
WHERE THE LOVE AT, when you're young, broke and black
It's over there, in the ashtray, who got a match?

We almost battled last year
You told your squad it was a big decision, but your circle stopped you from gettin' drugged: thats an intervention
Im about to take it back to the old Day, like you reminiscin
Why talk? I'll let that four warn him like a premonition
You get attention ridin' this gimmick wave  are you for sale, Lyt?
I'm too bar heavy so you gon' fail, Lyt
Soon as you brake, you gettin' lit up; Im on your tail, Lyt
I know they told you that shit he brew is real light
That magic may trick some, but ask me if Im impressed
40 with the ski mask, but I still fire TEC's
Get your mic jacked by the schemes if you try and flex
Dont flop, Im about to show my ass with this dialect
See, I confess, play your position before you end a rhyme
They receive a cue, B, a girl is who they sent to find
That attack'll put a DE against the spine
And send him runnin' back for safety if you kick a offensive line
Now, man-to-man, Im in my zone
You wanna prove that you real cold
But soon as Chill touch down, that's just another failed goal
I feel bold, so I'ma scheme and I'ma punch 'til my hands swell
Its hard to bear Lyt, he watered down like Amstel
Tell Davone Campbell I got a pump full of damn shells
I'll cock back, give the V one and watch his camp bail
Hell, Ill tap yo mans and ask, "Is he real rappin?"
The clip extends to rock a set, we got that steel clappin
At a van, riddlin' doors, but we still clappin
Pros act like I am bein' fake, so we peels at em
Value my realness, Im makin' Lyt shine like Edison, Cali
Im cold, but this is stuff he knows, the flows better in Cali
That been a drill, but hell deny Quill, put him to sleep
So this pen is sealin' his faith since he met us in Cali
The chick you met in the Valley threw me the Alley
Thats beyond clear cause what I ride in attract her like John Deere
See, Im a risk, watch the level Im on, clear
Play escalator, you cant move me with long stares
Im strong here, so I dont care where they found yall, Day
But I respect where you from, its real around yall way
But tell Lyt if he dont bounce the round ball way
Hell die over and over: I will Groundhog Day
I hope you came with 44s and war forts
If I lose, think womens basketball: Im a poor sport
Trust me, if Day see dukes it aint short shorts
Im gettin' money out of this ring, its like Divorce Court
I got the torch, who could match the heat that I bring?
Fuck Brock! I stopped The Deadman's streak in the ring
Fuck props! You gon' never see Chilla in disguise
Fuck your mask! I want you to look yo' killa in the eyes


Let me ask the mass, was it the mask
That got yall newbs attracted to the black dude?
Mmkay, mmkay...
They say I might get robbed at Vendetta 2
If Im not still armed with lines
Judges, Ill probably gotcha in a Jax move
Well, lets go back to UW when I hit Arsonal
Then I hit Ray, then told him Ill beat thunder head
In the shortest year
A sharp line-up, how did I get over there?
I showed you I can score, peon niggas dont understand
How much I get paid? Sigh, racks! My network green
Every sector vector know I can draw with the claw out
$500,000 in my PayPal, I got money in the web, spinnin'
I showed you I could ball out
This one's for the women  I wonder, can she see?
I would leave B lyin' folded with the knife, look
I told you Im nice, you seen what I did to ICE: "Good night, wolf!"
My purple niggas, they reign, King
If you think this is a big joke, bro please, youll get left toasty
If my man come from the corner
And press start at the right time, nigga, you will get smoked
And Verb dumbass think he could beat me
He must be sniffin' that Lou 'caine again
Nigga, he gon' need some huge luck
Moral of the story is: Verb bringin' them weak ass punches to the boss? Ha ha ha ha! Nigga, you suck!
Its the simple arms of the boy with the chopper
Any kid who lift that K knows he have to face the metal
Or else its a curse, he get fucked
Life lived in reverse, they have to embrace the devil
Thats constant battles with Constantine
Inuyasha talent inside this dream
Valid, magnets got your scene
Drag him into the entrance, cause I adore you
What I got for you is somethin' I call a catastrophic scheme
Pay attention! They say be antic free
Granted the agreement, I need true gossip, beside the wealth
All I see is pussies at the top of that animal kingdom
Mufasas, pride is felt  but oh, am I scarred?
I see Chilla wanna rumble with the king of the jungle
Some know the pain that a lion felt
When he get called out by the little cats  are you kiddin me?
How can a meow be mistaken for a cry of help?
Forsaken, casualties, they die and melt
By any means, long as the crew is first to check
Gradually, the galaxy is on Orion's belt
You know what that means? The whole universe is next
Your plan of attack is to scheme?
Thats your weapon? Cool
Guard deck and move, everybody should expect a snooze
This is the die section, split him, dissected
My suggestion is Lux is who yall best to choose
You got put in for a second move, lesson bruised
Undercard name shame, but I kept it cool
Under one exception: lose
I am who you cant defeat, boo boo
Cause this match is a steppin' stool
Price our logo, know I could rock or dial
Any stage filled full of cod fishes, Im a boss, Chilla
I remain a GP.S. thats why I could never be a lost nigga
I am just a divine hero
One who will leave a remainder but could divide zero
Tie, he know; thats a Mission Impossible, Im watchin' you
Anything in my vision get ICU
I see you the one grasps this, line graphic, die, bag flip
Sad shit is I gotta NBA off the block with steals
For real, my stats sick, whos next to get stretched out with dots? Glock's my number one draft pick
I had whos nexts to get stretched out with Dots
Glock's my number one Giraffe pick
I caught your raffle ticket
I told you Im nice 'round here, like Im afro-pickin
You fall out of place and break
I send dog out of space, hell get a taste of how Astro kick it
I want a lil body to pass: no midget
And I told you thats the game plan
That Im on; every word they get wrong lead to a body
I hope you can hang, man
I got 'em sayin', "Dang! Man, what is this nigga about?!"
I told you Im ahead with the lines
And if that dont stick, figure it out
Thought you was gon' win a battle today, I got this one
You win some and you lose some
But you live to see another day To the Batmobile!


You used gimmicks versus Magic for two reasons
To see your green grow like chia
And so they wouldnt cheer for what was in store: IKEA
He from Watts, plus Lyt be over heads, I got an idea
I make him lie since youll get your head shot before they ID ya
He up front like he snatched my plate, I hate cowards
I will split Day in thirds for sayin' he ate ours
Get anywhere I peel grim'd
Then get him shipped, like the Mayflower
Kill Lyt inner G, put son down to stop Day power
You tryna red our back cause Celtic pride made it from Boston?
Im bulletproof with the pen, I know you hate what Im jottin
Lush offered me more money, since he payin Im rockin
Now Im here, in livin color, so who you slayin and robbin?
This aint a blank, man, it bring major pain when the tool squeeze
So, if Day men weigh and move E
Its cool, cause I just killed him in Damon Wayan movies
Im truly sick, niggas dont get the win from me often
Remind me of a ventriloquist how dumb he talkin'
They dial Jones, then my stock mark it, watch money droppin'
Now I'ma bring it to 'em, B, like a mummys coffin
To 'em, B? See, thats "tomb," like where you goin, you
See dots in front of Lyt house: thats an ocean view
I was coachin' you, cause I support everyones grind
Truth is I only took Daylyt to see my son shine
Now, in some minds, they like, Why you usin synonyms for?
Well, why not? Words is weapons and Im sendin him fours
Catch Lyt with all his friends, now Im sendin him foes
He hit my phone, like, Jones, what you sendin them for?!
Its cause you snitchin' and told the pigs Im sinnin
You sendin infos, so now yall all fucked
Its like Im sendin nymphos
But let me jog your mental to take you they sent me two checks
Joey Crawford: Im official with these two TECs
Ill blast, split his house in half, thats how I do, Plex
You told me he was slammin' in the ring, I should sue Plex
Get X'd with magazines, I dont play, boy
Im about to put holes in your man's shin: no Hugh Hef
If dude flex in the ring and start the worst trouble
I'ma snap with the shoulder strap like purse buckles
Take rounds, get em let down, Im here to burst bubbles
Get at em and even the score with the first couple
Shout out to Cali Smoov, he had a similar bar for Nitty, too
But while Im at it, let me respond to that little shot Nitty threw
My city crew good with blades, so if he run theyll still split 'em
Do him and his brothers grim, that mean if Rum pull steel, skin him!
And if he still livin on December 25th, Ima pop and spray
This can, itll kill him, then after Christmas theyll be boxin Day
Boss town!


A lot of yall know me as Daylyt
But since my mom in here, she know me as Noobie
She asked me what it means
It means I spit nasty: its a lugie
True B, you see how Im fluent with the speech?
I know how to surprise the slower
I spit a line, Glee, thats for the geeks
Dont worry about how whos the liver flow-er
Just know before you ever spit
The ability to scheme different elements style cry for help
And I molded, you stole it, give me my credit, I said it
Youll never get it down, prime example of who I am
Im on-call talent, I tell 'em its down time
Look at all the niggas I under ate, thats a star for the crowd shine
Four lines in one, dial 9: thats pound sign
Speakin of pound signs, niggas been comin at me with that L BS
Wait pound signs, LBS, weight
We are not on the same scale, frame frail
Under all pressure, yes sir, but its lesson in vain, swell
Slug my back? Main snail
He lyin out that ass, I guess its the same tail
My game real, I get paid for every bar I come up with
Yall can see all of my brain sells
Thats the way I was trained, double lines
A Trak, take that, way back, before you could talk, man
See, these babies got drive way before they could walk, man
To the station, but I say F em in the AM
Cause thats where I'ma bury your life
When a baby goes, death gets broadcasted through the radios
I guess hes just another stereotype
Tune into this one!
The last nigga I battled in front of him, they was savin his time
I hit him with a Gangsta's Paradise line
Thats what happens when you dealin with them dangerous minds
My name over them headlines
From them over-the-head lines: Coolio, he legit
Bars like that, they like, "You need to quit."
"How could you rule?"  Im like "You see the spit."
Its my duty to be the shit
They need a fix, its crackin you all, but you all broke
Wired, house shattered
They need to fix that crack in the wall that yall broke
See the wires? House shattered
They cant fix it when Im crackin you all
And your jaw broke, wired fire, nigga
Whoever in front of me will be flat: I retire niggas
Its the ocean of flames  see fire, nigga!
Get a whole honeycomb silenced  be quiet, nigga!
I told 'em I rely on my rage
Niggas who doubt him, how come the outcome is Malcolm X?
You hand out of pocket, youll die on the stage
And I rely on my babe, cause she a Cap and wild gunner
Shell close her eyes, point the deuces to ring like Pacquiao mother
And I really feel like I got this one
You win some and you lose some
But you'll live to see another Quill not this one


Alcatraz bars  who the fuck gon' break you out?
Your day 26, thats how Ima take you out
Face blew out, youll be done if I give D one
For actin I'll leave him on the floor from this knee, son
Get it? Liam Neeson, you mustve missed Taken 2
But get your aim up, cause Ill never miss takin' two
Follow you and shorty to wherever miss taken to
Oh, you dont believe that you and your miss taken too?
Thats why I kill you, then kill her, she mistaken too
One: you taken this battle was a mistake  and two:
She see Im fly, and yes, I'm who your miss taken to
And thats why I got the pipe that your miss takin too
Could kidnap him, you could get your miss taken too
Youll see D split like I broke his mixtape in two
Breakin news, Im officially a beast
Family curse: Im leavin every kin of D deceased
Capisce? See, they love me in Cali: Im like Tiger Ty
Put Lyt on his ass in secs when that fire fly
Your wifes a bird, he like, "That lies absurd."
Thats cause she gave Ghost face and blew Meth like Heisenberg
My mind's disturbed, I'ma relapse
Be sharp, D, mine are dangerous
To see major stacks theyll leave a G flat
And some'll rise, but whoever do gettin recapped
Ill fire on the front of your head, now thats a Heat cap
Repeat that for thinkin that a tool cant blaze ya
Youll need defense for your face, like the tool man neighbor
I will send two shots just to make sure your death come
The first pop teach you how to crawl, he the best one
The second pop raise the nigga up, like a stepson
Both made of metal, when they rose he jet, son
Im gettin paid to check Day, like its check day
Plus, I aim high when that TEC spray
You five deep? Well, I'ma let two heads roll, aimin for necks, Day
After I make two more roll, you next, Day
Im who the best say is the best in this whole game
Chilla, thats my code name  plus, thats a cold name
Niggas actin bold cause they at home, shit is so lame
But I make dickheads pussy in the ring with no shame
And tell your whole gang
Ill practice bangin where they hangin, Day
So if Im washin ten with the hawk, Im just trainin, Day
I hope you prayin, Day any gimmick, you better use it now
Against Mr. Jump To Top Tier From The Proving Grounds


To be amongst the All Stars they say bring all bars
Nah, I need my fame
Cause that last battle versus Rich Dolarz
He got broke in half in that 4th quarter
Oh my god, things have changed
I seen the plot to get a crazy feat, what a dream!
The little King Of Pop, it was ABC, what I mean
It dont matter if you black or white
Your career, I got to beat it
They ask why? I tell 'em its human nature to attack son
Niggas like me dont care about love
Cause we the realer niggas that might go jack son
Smooth criminal, remember the time?
I was lookin at my reflection in the mirror
The one with the realest curls
Thought I was dolo, noble fans tellin me
"Day, you are not alone, you can heal the world."
But whos badder than me with them bars? Nobody
I do niggas dirty, die in a box in the sky, soon as the night slid
And I got an underlyin mission
The inside of me remains Black Power
But the media shows I got the white kids
Who think and shout? And I tell 'em, "Fuck these lil boys!"
And they wanna throw me in the rapist route
Soon as I come up with somethin positive
And they hand me the mic, son, they blank it out
But Im proud to see, Momma
I made it through all these bitch niggas that was doubtin me
I knew how to get their attention
All I had to do was hang a lil' white son off the balcony
But thats just the normal rules of the slum gang
Rock Man on a treadmill: nigga, I run things
Nigga, you gave me the shot, I shoot stupid: I got dumb aim
The clip will take you to the movies, shorty: my gun bangs
And I heard you work at the Quik-E-Mart
Yeah, so I'ma catch him waitin at the liquor store
Pass holmes, put the mask on, like, "Yeah, I'ma lick a store."
Run up to him and ask him, "Hey, my nigga!
Where you got all that high price liquor stored?"
He run he gone fall, blow his tongue on the wall
Now you could lick the store
If its money to pay, why owe me?
You be in the street left wide, homie
Family screamin out, "Why, homie?!"
Half your body in Boston, the other half in Wyoming
If I chase a nigga, Glock break a nigga
Funeral homes, box-wake a nigga
You get the open hand, the fist or the deuce: rock, paper, scissors
Ill cock at his feet, these birdies better learn to dance
Or itll be arms in the front, arms in the back
It look like the Pee Wee Herman dance
Off the bat, this is how I know I got ya
You'll get your shit shot in the Matrix  blocka!
And I really feel like I got this one
You win some and you lose some
But you live to see another Day well, not this one




As we return to the 36 Chambers
The RZA, the GZA, the Ol' Dirty BZA
U-God, Chef, the Ghostface Killah
And Meth, Rebel I soldier for the foreclosure
Don't forget about the Masta yo


Motherfuckers halt when my Colt start stomping
Thunder strikes your land with the jolt
Your stamina level is low like currents from
The volts of relentless punishment that multiplies
At a speed that the naked eye can't detect
The infantry, peep the weapontry as I bomb atomically
Stagnant they stood surrounded and astounded
By this total square mileage of violence that I brung
I've not yet begun to stung, it's the ethics
And rigorous training methods of the Abbott
Incite oversees the opposition
Penetrates then infiltrates, breaking down your resistance
Leaving competition defenceless
Masta, Hip Hop antagonizer
Dumb, deaf and blind civilizer with the silencer


Piledriver Tut boulder face blow Hulk
Anger rap book causing chess blade smoke
Monster truck, punk, elephant gun poke
Jawbreaker humanoid vice grip, choke
Face the inferno, maestro pull it
Pipe hard slang, bite the golden bullet
Never, sold my soul Golden Arm cold stinger
See me on the streets address me stone bringer
Ease away, freeze back, feedback, play out in sweet
Action packed rap, bite it, stomp on the beat
Possess hollow head battle teeth Tony Atlas
Wu status now wisdom to the masses


Cock back my tongue like a hammer
My head is like a nickel-plated bammer
Spit .45 caliber grammar
At the speed of wind makes you bleed within
Crack your skull without penetrating your skin
Reign of champ official, Wu stamp with black pistols
Spent the weekend programming fat tracks at Camp Crystal


Home on the range, rebel with a pen
Writing critically acclaimed scriptures that do you in
Mr. Mef, Hot Nickels
Say my shit holding my sex pistol, deal me in


The bewildering Killa Bee quickly sting ya
I ain't gotta lift one fucking finger
Make sure the God Irief turns on the ringer
We ducking the subpoena
Fatal Flying Guillotine machine from Medina


Check the 150 millimeter heater
As it blows holes through your fucking speaker
(Makin you weaker creeping inches centimeters)
{Fifty caliber street sweeper
Shots from Shaolin that go to Massapequa}


Things'll never be the same after this one
Ghostrider spit flame, lay back and twist one
Recognize the Gods came for one accord
One mind and one common cause, that's the shit Son
Play them crows out position, you might hear me
But you don't listen, competition come and get some on
Red marker still bleeding through the paper
Of his sick premeditated murder caper


I walk with the Shaolin strut, burn a dutch
Watch Street eat 'em up, Cold Crush bum rush
Spot rusher get touched, bagged up, handcuffed
Y'all niggas can't fuck with us


Pass me the Black Velvet, embassy suite, killing me
Spell it, Maxi Priest caught me in a daze up on Delancey Street
Stand solar, deadly vengeance with a crowbar
It's like the dreads worshipping Jah, so Aloha
Pineapple crush, 850 swerve it with a rush
Plush the Canola Range spitting off the roof, holding my change
Yo it's ragtime, universal 12 Monkey mind
It's like stalking through your airport with a chunky .9


The underboss Staten New York
Bloodsport gun talk holding fort back, take 'em to court
It's the burner Shaolin bound face down you gets murdered
Roadblock shell shocked, stretched on a back block
Yo it's warfare when you ring here, slugs fly through mid-air
Landing thugs in wheelchairs from the slugfest
Keeps the iron, where the head rest for the conquest subway
Wordplay ricochet through your projects, crime pays
Matched up in a staircase in a dark place embraced
By the trey-eight, I'm in so deep I can't escape
These crime situations, I stay in man formation
A shot echoes through the ghetto locations y'all remain
P.L.O., slam cats like Bam Bam Bigelow
Throw a flow like Nomo, relate like Fidel Castro
I be the great all pro, hanging MCs by they logos
My street journal reacts and blaze like an inferno




That summer... the summer '88 is the best...
But that's your nostalgia though
"Just for the nostalgia," you gotta say
That's my most nostalgic moment of hip-hop music ever
Right


I'll just sit right here and sing that good, old-school shit to you
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own
Oh baby you know
All that lovemaking we did
Boy, it was so real, I wanna feel that again
Long lost friend from way back when
Eric B was president
Tell me where the melody went
And if you still care, say ''yeah, yeah, yeah''
Sing it like I used to do
This one is for me and you, oh


La-di-da-di-da-di-da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
And oh baby, you know
Make love
Thats how you do it
Just like you did it back then
This is dedicated to you


I'll just sit right here and sing that good old school shit to you
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own
Oh baby you know, that love making we did
Boy, It was so real, I wanna feel that again
Loyal friends from way back then
Tell me can you vision us
36 Chambers high
Feels like were there, yeah yeah yeah
Remix of a fantasy, I hear em singing back to me like...


La-di-da-di-da-di-da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
And oh baby you know. make love
Thats how you do it
Just like you did it back then
This is dedicated to you


Nah, we dont wish todays game was old again
We just wish it wasnt full of Draconian, Babylonian, phony men
FOH my summation fascinates, we have debates
Whos the greatest living or passed away
I ask MC, see what she has to say
Eric B or Master P, some see it differently
87 meant to me? I try to describe it, you try to relive it
I try to revive it hoping that you get it, yeah
Something about La Di Da Di got inside our bodies
Something about My Adidas coming out the speakers
Used to do the Wop or the Pee-Wee Herman
Rest in peace Heavy D, Moneyearnin Mount Vernon
Lets go


La-di-da-di-da-di-da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
And oh baby you know
Make love
Thats how you do it
Just like you did it back then
This is dedicated to you


Oh baby you know
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you




The way that momma raised us was pure faith
So diablo wouldn't faze us or daze us
Or lay us down to sleep
Know the wolf from the sheep
Or the sheep who cried wolf
And threw the deadly hoof
While the wolf was asleep
I keep my mind a ghost
Follow my heart the most
Don't play fools too close
Sleep with my eyes at post
So Diablo won't be hostin the game of life
The knife sits by throats of the young
And blows death straight through the lungs
As the mind gets washed by visions of sugar plums
But we shall overcome cause we ain't dumb
But we ain't smart, they got the girls by the hearts
And the niggas by the nuts
Ear, tongue and butts
Yeah, they're trying to fuck us up
But, shit, you know what's up
We gotta get with the movement
And move men soon
They consume every womb who bares
Beneath the stairs of their doom
Best believe they're gonna shove em in a tomb

Chorus: repeat 4X

Cause everytime I step to the microphone
I put my soul on 2 inch reels
That I don't even own


Early Saturday mornin I was cartoon gazin
Slowly broke into the kitchen
To fill a bowl with some Raisin Bran
As I ran up and down the TV stations
I witnessed Indian Joe
Getting tricked out of this nation
By a silly hillbilly
Who laughed as the shit happened
Everything's the same
The game continued into rappin
Deception is at an all-time high
You give a piece of your soul
To receive some crumbs from the pie
But you know I keep on rappin til the break of dawn
Even though it is my soul that I do not even own

Chorus: repeat 4X


I was po', black and broke
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
Ass-out, wide open waitin for my shit to come on out
Speakin about the time before I got signed
I was coolin behind Coolio in the County Line
My big brother used to say I was an asshole
Didn't graduate, couldn't handle the hassle
Of high school, why fool
Wit' foolish rules and guidelines
Fuck the cap and tassels
Said forget the trade and tried rhymes
Hooked up with J-Swift, got with 2-4-2
Me and my nigga L.A. Jay back at S.C.U
I grab the MIC one-time
Check it, 1-2, we in
Freakin' major flavors with my fellow Nubians
Takin shit to the next level
Too bad I sold my soul to the fuckin devil



INT. HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS/ROUTE 22  MORNING 

INT. SECRET HALLWAY

SAM
What is this place?

ANDREW
I think you can see into the hotel rooms.

MAN ON SCREEN
Oh, yeah! Ohh! Ohh! Yeah!

MARK
Hey whats up, dog? Were kind of in a rush.

DIEGO
It can wait. Hes about to cum.

MAN ON SCREEN
I'm gonna fuckin' cum.! 

INT. CORRIDOR

DIEGO
That shit was hot. That shit was hot. I gotta go drop some knowledge on that ho right there.

SAM
How do you know she's a hooker?

DIEGO
Of course she's a fuckin' hooker. Girls who look like her do not fuck guys that look like him, unless it's for coke, money or fame.

SAM
Well, Julia Roberts married Lyle Lovett.

DIEGO
Who the fuck are you?

MARK
This is Sam. This is Large.

DIEGO
No offense, man. But why are you bringing these fuckin' people here?

MARK
This is the guy who needs that thing. Wait. I brought you the tank. Okay? Could you just tell us where to go now?

DIEGO
That thing come with balloons?

MARK
What am I, a fuckin' birthday clown? No. It doesn't come with balloons. Suck it off the tap. And I need it back when you're done because that guy's holdin' my 39 bucks.

DIEGO
All right. Hold up. Hold up! Who here just saw some titties? Raise your hand if you just saw some titties. Hmm?  Thank you! So everybody just calm the fuck down! Now. You know where Kiernan's Quarry is?

EXT. KIERNANS QUARRY - LATER

MARK
Down in Newark, right?

DIEGO
Yeah.

DIEGO
It's at the bottom of Hillside and Rivington. You can't really see it from the street, but it's there. Park your car at the gate and hop the fence. At the bottom of the quarry, there's this junkyard run by this guy named,  Albert. He's the one that tracked down the piece you're lookin'for. All right? I'll call him right now and tell him to expect you.

ANDREW
Okay, stop. What the fuck are we doin'?

MARK
Just be patient, man.

ANDREW
We've been patient all day, but it's my last day and you haven't told us what we're doin'. If you told me we were going on a six-hour hunt for blow, I would've passed.

MARK
If I was gonna get you coke, we would've gone to the fuckin' high school football practice. We would have been rolling five hours ago.

ANDREW
I think we corrupted this innocent girl enough.

SAM
I'm not innocent!

ANDREW
Yes, you are! All right? That's what I like about you. I don't want this guy taking you to, like, some sketchy quarry, in the middle of nowhere to find, like, crack whores huffing turpentine or pit bulls raping each other or whatever it is you have us doing!

MARK
Wow. That's like the most worked-up I've ever seen you.

SAM
He was protecting me.

ANDREW
So?

SAM
He likes me.

ANDREW
Don't be cute.

SAM
He's my knight in shining armor.

ANDREW
Don't talk about knights in front of Mark. It's a sore subject.

MARK
I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.

ANDREW
Pun intended?

MARK
Oh, you're fuckin'

SAM
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

ANDREW
Ow! Ow!

EXT. KIERNANS QUARRY - CONTINUED

MARK
Oh, my God.

SAM
Wow!

ANDREW
I never even knew this was here.

MARK
I've heard about it. They were supposed to build a mall here, I think.

SAM
Yeah. I remember reading about that in the paper, that they were... digging or something, and they break into this natural phenomenon. It's like an underground Grand Canyon or something. Now they're in some huge legal battle over whether they can build here or not.

ANDREW
Can you imagine the guy whose job it is to fight for his right to build a mall, on some, like, geological phenomenon?

MARK
They love their malls here, man. All right. Let's find this guy and get out of here.

ANDREW
You're not gonna tell us what we're getting?

MARK
It's a surprise. You'll see.

SAM
I think it's gonna rain.

Mile of terror motor mouth, let the odour out
Fuming greater, the temper in my spine huminator
The super grass childish blast sleepy eye stash
The hashish masterpiece, Osirus is the virus
This split second splash, severe drop is near pop
There's falling teardrops, now is it worth your career?




I'm in the weed spot, pounds of purp
All the cereal cartoons is on, my favorite shit is the Smurfs
Now I don't slip when I'm down in the dirt
Cause by this time I done seen life and figured the amount that it's worth
It's the first, cops is looking for work
Got my niggas all cuffed up, sweating like a hooker in church
This old woman on her way to the church
She said the neighborhood's fucked up, and we the ones that's making it worse
Now that's fucked up!
I hit the block hard, Timberlands is scuffed up
No justice in the system, look around, it's just us
They tell me only God can judge us
But they ain't ever met Judge Koffler
I'm looking at this cracker on the bench
Don't understand, I only sold crack to pay the rent
Got possession with intent
Player, I ain't stressing, I'm a pimp
My bitches love the cocktail dressing with the shrimp


Cause we do it like how we do it
This is big truck shit
Diesel fluid
Slay bitches with the Shaolin slang
Stapleton
Park Hill
We just doing our thing


You fools don't have a clue, do you?
Moving them keys crucial, troopin like Isuzu
Nigga, your weed doo-doo, we burn that Cali kush
My flow be on steroids, that shit that Barry took
Hurting the game like the corns that's on your daddy's foot
My niggas carry big guns, y'all niggas carry books
You shook niggas get stripped, beated and wiped out
ConEd status like Fab, nigga it's "Lights Out"
What your life 'bout? Nigga, my life plush
I lost both of my parents, my nigga life sucks
Us Billy Boys hold toys
Cause they don't like us
Raw like the nose on a fiend sniffing that white stuff
Moving with the semi
Eggplant Pennies
Hopping out the Bentley
Looking like I just won an Emmy
Never been a sloucher, dogg cause I'm an alpha-male
Got that product on sale, look at your voucher
Leave that other gang
I'm Spanky, you Alfalfa
Little Rascals
With no hassle I will out ya
Sincerely doubt ya
And I will house ya
Posted out in front of your crib just like a scapler


Cause we do it like how we do it
This is big truck style shit
Diesel fluid
Slay bitches with the Shaolin slang
Stapleton
Park hill
We just doing our thing


Every time pick up the mic
I put work down
Cops don't like me cause I live in a murk town
My high school homies sold crack through songs
You can't get right through the team, like two wrongs
Mad "Criminal Minded" "C.R.E.A.M." muthafuckas
Type of subliminal rhymes: scheme muthafuckas
Can't shake the monkey, life is a bitch
Jake tried to jump me, wifey a snitch
Killa bees wild like C-74
New York bitch, adolescents at war
Fuck the government, yo, they made us this way
You a faggot: listen to what that chick say
Escape route gotta be free like ?
Fuck hoes, nigga I don't care if the world know
Hardcore
Move with or without Clan
Diss me in the cab and they murk your man
I'm a general
Don, with the crazy hype game
You don't like me, wanna feel my knife game
Killah Hill, son
They don't like where I live at
Came from Hollywood so I fight to give back
Real talk
Hard jeans and hard dick
Move in and out of state like drugs and garbage
Nigga feel me
Or feel that blast
ATF, bitch
Just guns and cash


Cause we do it like how we do it
This is big truck style, shit
Diesel fluid
Slay bitches with the Shaolin slang
Stapleton
Park hill
We just doing our thing

(Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck)
Hahahaha.. yeah..


Yo, you don't wanna ride with Dirt, you still stuck in coach
You don't wanna fly in first, yo, I can spit
One verse, and leave in a new Benz-er
Take a trip down south and put some hoes to work, you hear me
Dirt McGirt, you niggas gon' respect it
I'm drunk and crunk so don't come in my direction
I'm ready to thump, and get the whole crew arrested
Bail 'em out, and laugh about it in Texas, yo
And get with Rome, down in Caki-Lac
And hit the spot, in the hood where the happenings at
Where the shootin' and the fightings and the stabbings at
Where the Lincolns and the Chevys and the Cadi's at, shit
Them down south niggas been loved Dirt
Take a shot to the head, if you been through the worse
Show respect to your niggas, who been doin' it first
And be comin' with that shit, I'm just doin' the worse


Yo, you don't wanna ride with Dirt, you still stuck in coach
You don't wanna fly in first, yo, I can spit
(Yo, you don't wanna ride with Meth, you still sniffing coke
Even if you tried your best, yo, I can spit)


Yeah, damn, I'm just like Dirt in the booth
I'm the truth, I don't need to go to church in a suit
Each verse is the proof, I drink a 100 Proof
Cop searching the coup, I got some herb in my boot
When Wu is coming through, the outcome: critical
Fucking with this style, the outcome: get physical
Meth get lyrical, and y'all can get my genitals
Don't forget them aid essentials, vitamins & minerals
Heh, ya'meen, I'm taking one for the team
Like Martin Luther King, taking one for a dream
I'm dope, to many fiends, live by many means
If you don't stand for nothing, you'll fall for anything
That's real shit, let's get this money real quick
Dirt Dog, I'm feeling this, but I'd rather feel rich
I mean filthy rich, I'm corporate now
Big Meth, the label's Def, that's why I talk so loud, nigga




Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck...

This recordin is dirty and it's stinkin
Funkier than Peppi Le Pew so I was thinkin, about
Droppin this single on the charts, lettin ya know
Hey, the kid has heart, I never deny myself as being
Dope, but in my last jam, niggas slept on my notes
You thought that I was weak? Huh? Let me speak
My rhymes come funkier than ya grandfathers feet
So listen mister, don't you ever forget
The rhyme is dirty, you couldn't even clean it
With Comet, for even Wolrex, some tried Ajax
Only mix with the best, forty-eight tracks
Yo, I get down with the Ason sounds
Lyrics that be flowin from miles around
So let the music shut ya ass up, then feel the uppercut
Now I make ya fall to ya butt

Yo, let me continue, verse number two
Style is wild, dirty and stinkin like doo-doo
If ya hangin around, ya changed ya mind
It is a bad influence, but yo it's my rhyme
I sit down and I say to myself, "Self
Yo, are you rated top the shelf?"
I drop the single for you to get a dose of
As I lay back like a pillow on a sofa
Gettin paid? Yeah right, Willy
Why askin me, G? What? What? What? What? You know me
My mouth is sugar, sweet as a honey bee
Taste like a forty, stinkin like Old-E
But I drink Ol' English so I speak Ol' English
You gotta be dirty and stinkish
And if it's not, well I guess I'm not
The A-S-O-N my friends, it's dirty and it's stinkin'




I'm not a statuatory raper
I'm _naughty_, but girl that ain't my _nature_
Johnny Cash all about this paper
You playin' wit the big boys now, we rated r
This no place for a child, 17, not allowed
Without a parent and it's apparent that you belong
Wit a full grown man wit a mind just as strong
Huh, so here's ya chance to advance
Get in ya stance and we gon' set up it off like true romance
And that's my word

"This is for, all my smokers"

Alright, give me one more time on the count of three
1, 2, 3 "This is for, all my smokers"
(Yo, ya'll done made the album, you heard) Yes sir
"This is for, all my smokers"
"This is for, all my smokers"


Aiyo, Meth, what's up, nigga?


Doc, what's really good?
Got that bush and that Backwood, light up in any hood
Yup, I'm that hood, my brother, love me some Cali kush
Never thought that little bush in that baggie would have me hooked
I'm a pothead, everyone look, and point your fingers
At the bad guys, with the cottonmouths and glass eyes
Huh, fuck it, I'm that high, I'm blowing smoke clouds
Got my head in the clouds, fuck it, I'm that fly
Doc, what's up, nigga?


Yo, you know how I bust
Find me drunk, fucked up at the Cannabis Cup
For those who don't smoke, get the middle finger up
You smoke more than us, nigga, it's beginner's luck
My truck, ride with 5-0 eyes on it
It's like the blunt, when you ain't got five on it
I challenge any opponent, who wanna smoke?
We can puff til our voice get lower than Tone Loc, like


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ain't nobody smoking more than me, up in here
(Aiyo, pump this shit, you get high off this here, because)

Aiyo, bump this, bitch, you get high off this here, because)
"This is for, all my smokers"


Yo, I'm like oh my God, oh my God
I start growing sour dies' in my home garage
Now niggas on the block, say I'm on my job
Cuz now I rock more chains than Amistad
This my 'entourage', this not HBO
A bitch see me, she like, oh there he go
You can smoke with the bro, if you got ass and nice tits
But fuck you, with that, I'm 'high off of life' shit


They tried to make me go to rehab, no
Tell my P.O. that I ain't trying let the weed bag, go
You can catch me in the whip, pushing the seats back slow
My chick's a Rican, that mean she off the meat rack, though
Look ma, I'm eating, cuz when it's time to get that dough
I sink my teeth in, and turn around and spit that flow
They call me beasting, I monster the booth, so in the cut
I leave 'em bleeding, little swag', with some Miss Dashing season




I got flavors, I major, baby, send in the troops
That Johnny Blaze ya, leave dashes in your Timberland boots
Can't fuck with haters, just mad I got a pocket of loot
I'm chasing papers, ya'll try'nna be a rock in my shoe
I'm a father, I don't drink with kids, these youngers thinking they hard
I think harder than they think they is
I'm bout as proper as my English is, and hope I did my thing
Before I die, for the things I did


Everybody light it up and smoke with your man
And cigarette smokers, change ya game plan
Cuz this is for all my, marijuana smokers
Backwoods, Swisher sweets, and Dutch rollers
Yeah, I pull over, start pulling out money
Cuz I by weed, like everyday 420
You know what else funny, I found was so gutter
I'm Cheech and Chong brother, just got different mothers

Cash rules everything around me, I'm fresh out the slum
Rich bum nigga, now I live dumb
Talking 'bout that cream
Leaning in the Tower of Pisa
Seven visas, got condos in the jungle
The mind stay rich but the pockets is well-filled
Let's violate this lil' area, get milk
I'm telling you, man, you don't want no part of this, fam
Get punched in the water like clams
KKK, slices, they one of the nicest
Stainless steel, sharp swords, dipped in ricin
Everybody eating, everybody full
Just a young bull lighting a Phillie, still a willy
Ball on 'em, in the Bentley with the wall on 'em
Yo, I'll sleep when I'm dead, like the hood, homies
Who get it cracking in the park, homes?
Park Hill narco, smoke and let the bones turn to charcoal
Let's get richer, kid
Signature Louis Rich, won't stop until there's billions in this bitch


Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop


I grew up on the rhyme side, that "gotta get mine" side
That white girl, we mix it with quinine
You players try and ball from the sidelines
While I'm aging like fine wine, you internet thuggin' somebody timeline
Between love and hate is a fine line
And these habitual line steppers can die trying
A New York Islander, my clique's NY Giants
A pocket full of NY (K)nicks for my clients
Y'all ain't buying, stop crying and stop lying
Hakuna Matata, no Mufasa, I'm not lion
You try to spit on that hot iron, you not iron
The irony 'cause that last shot just shot by him
So let's start it with this, son, motivate him with this one
If you ain't got no haters, go get some
Is anybody greater? There is none
Assorted 'Now And Laters', my clan got too many flavors to pick from


Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop


Deuce high when I start my game
It's like, you should see it live dog, all you see is sparks and flames
I grab bags and I park my ways, the way I have 'em all locked
You would think they gave they heart to bae
Bet on us, baby, ain't no better odds to play
It's hard to fake, my real life is on display
Either love or hate whatever part you play
I take the best of both worlds like R. and Jay
Own boss, no third party
Produce more murder than Irv Gotti
Like I'm working on my third body
Deck, kill it quick
24/7 bed rest, that's how ill it get
Can't stop if I mash the brakes
Got the cash it takes, I might flash my face
Half an eighth got me floating like I'm trapped in space
Not safe for your workplace, a basket case


Don't stop, never stop
Can't stop getting this guap
Fat money knot, hammer cock, curry hot
Cook a fool, hit the block
No shorts, bring it back
Flipping this, stack that
Free it up, weigh it up
Don't stop, never stop
Can't stop getting this guap
Fat money knot, hammer cock, curry hot
Cook a fool, hit the block
No shorts, bring it back
Flipping this, stack that
Free it up, weigh it up
Quest for success with my mind on my money
Came a new rhyme saying "Wu-Tang is the best"
Music
Yeah, peace to Khaled

Dialogue

[Outro: RZA}
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop



Who's your favorite group?? WU TANG




Come on my niggas, yo..
Put your guns in your right hand and hold it down towards the floor
Point all your guns down towards the floor for a minute
Yeah, you could hold 'em, just point 'em down towards the floor
For a sec, aight? (Yo y'all ain't fuckin' wit the Wu)
We gon' splash like this, all my wild Digi heads
(Y'all niggas is crook) Y'all niggas move a little up to the front
Y'all niggas know what I'm talkin' about
Word up, my weedheads, y'all play the right for a second
Nahmean? Check it out
All y'all niggas on X, y'all keep y'all asses in the back
Aight? Straight up, in fact, matter of fact
We gon' mingle this shit like mothafuckin' peas in the mothafuckin' pot
Straight up Digi Digi style, word up, as we splash you right
(Yeah, yeah, my niggas is crew, now y'all ain't
Fuckin' wit the Wu
Oh now y'all.. come on!)


Walk wit a diddy bop ock, you silly pop, Jiffy Pop
Fuck around, son, I'll blow ya face up with fifty shots
Sharp darts, and it pop pop like tarts
Extreme speed like Anakin inside the Pod
Headed for the finish line, BOODOO, watch Bobby cross it
Hoes with the diamonds on your toes, come on and floss it
I be one of those tall skinny cats with the four-nine
Three-eleven that rips through Power-U's and breaks spines
I culture power-tuggin' boys who be drunk, buggin'
Lovin' loud noise from toys, club thuggin'
Sweet chocolate deluxe, rugged, sexy buttercup
That don't give a fuck about the cop in the club
Or the bouncer with the flashlight, one walked passed, right?
Some pulled the razor and chopped his ear like he was Mad Mike
I played the cipher in the corner, teachin' math
One for one thoughts, a hundred brothers won't last
"Do U"
Because you can't do me
"Do U"
Because you can't do me
Come on!


Yo, son, Wake Up!
Yo, I gotta do this, man
I gotta get this money, son

Features in the crowd, appearance like, "Black I'm proud"
In the background, no sounds, four pound, we hold ground!
Brooklyn bound, seven initials up in the crown
One man's ramblin', officials they shot him down
Supreme, extreme, lean, killin' machines
All I wanna do is feed my seed, plus my team
Keep it logical, no games, straight up about Prodigal
Diabolic drums and I run from none
Testimony one, give my life before my only son
Thelonious crumbs, why they wanna press me for guns?
Now I'm in the face of the judge, court case thug
From a race, laced, based on drugs, some made slugs
As it was written, stroll through any block forbidden
Glock hidden, why they wanna stop precision?
Eighty-five percent of my brothers locked in prison
And we just keep dyin' for the love of good livin'
But Do U! Do U! Do U!




You know those jams in the park, produced the spark
Made me feel words how I read books in the dark
I always took it to heart, loved the art
A lifetime of darts, ripped crews apart
Made their stay real short, I stamped the passport
Couldn't bring through no wack shit of no sort
I walked the borough challengin' the best that stood
Torch metal mics, they conduct better than wood
Once I electrify and only expect to die
Rounded Bed-Stuy, ZZZZ, nigga fry
My opponent block, the beat comin' from his box
Investment ranker who's a joke in the stocks
Keep a rhythmic pace, maintainin' great balance
Movin' in steps of unheard of silence
Normally progressioners, they're slow steepin'
Niggas wanna light up when there's gas leakin'


"Do U feel?"



Yeah yeah yeah


You ain't live til you caught a lick and book it
Made a chick eat another chick pussy
Which one of ya niggas wanna push me
I get gully everything get gushy
I see how a hater might hate this
When it come to winner all races
When it come to winnin my place
Is number one all you mothafucking faces
God damn that Math Hoffa
With a chick, nice ass, big knockas
I ain't gotta smash I could watch her
If I go b*tch she still go aca
Tell her, warm fellow
They say money talks imma tell her
Always come back do another and I'mma be an open door forever


Just for you babe mic check mic checker, yeah mic check mic checker
Heard you out of town and your girl get around
So while your away I might checker
Yeah, open the door, yeah
Open the door, don't be silly or I'mma kick it like biggie
Shotgun pump double barrel, shotgun pump double barrel
Shotgun pump double barrel, shotgun pump double barrel
Or I'mma kick it like biggie


You ain't live to make you made your first million
And top models wanna swallow your children
I thought I told you wu tang for the children
Way before rap moving crack in the building
Now whats the price of rice in china
This shit is tryin to raise the price on their vagina
Me I'm tryin to live the life and get the grinda
But I ain't tryin get the shina
Pop off no question show dirty like no question no protection
When the kid hold court no objections
Knock me this money at the door no exception
I go hard in the pain of the rapper
I go hard on the skin no viagra
You think I'm trippin'
Ain't in the trickin
But keep a stone (?) in the kitchen who the master






Oh here they come with the ruckus of the drunk
Funk doc (Meth-Tical) the veterans of medicine
Natural fruit juices, that alcohol beverage


Come to get it on with that crooked ass veteran
Introduction you to this new special brew
Natural fruit juicin, alcohol double duecin
Take what the truth is, that rhyme through your toothless


Hey yo what are you a doofus? (Actin like you ruthless)
Guzzle that St. Ides, Superman flies through the skies
I'm crooked, leavin y'all chinky eyed
In case you were lookin
Ghetto natural now represent
I flip the script if you ain't
Hike up my guns and malt liquor
Drink it down to the sticker
If you can't finish it quicker


Pineapple, coconut, lemon lime fashion
Mixed fruit, put it on ice and it be smashin




Hahahahahaaa
Follow... just do what ya feel and never follow
Never follow...
Just do what ya feel and we gon' follow
Just do what ya feel and never follow
Just do what ya feel and never follow
Haha, Methodical


Who wanna flip with the acrobatic
From ground zero all the way to attic, what we be smokin, Tical
The resevoir is now open
I swim the English Channel backstrokin, you don't know me or my style
We hold court and blow trial
You catch 'cal when you browse through my X-Files, who be next now
Man's down, hands down
Hold ground by yo' side when it go down, I dedicate this next dart
To my fucking heart
Little Meth he the best part, now walk with that one, word
Time Time 4 Sum Aksion
Dreamin bout Toni Braxton, blowin her back out like Bob Backlund
I'm throwin wrestlin holds
Tag team with Funk Doc, we in funk mode, take yo' best shot
If it don't hip it don't hop
If it don't quit it don't stop, that's the life


I be the super-lyrical individual I be splittin through
That Teflon material to knock Big Ben off of schedule
Better move with a set of tools
I be doin it to mics when I'm a, heterosexual
I load the mic then cock, drop it like three-quarters
When I slaughter don't get, caught in the water
Cause the Brick's got it's own World Order
Leave your bitch in shock like the third rail caught her
Styles stay deeper than orca, I float the seven seas with ease
Did more drugs than pharmacies
So call me that lyrical Genovese, you can't compare
Get you steppin like stairs, frats, sororities
Don't make me bring it on back I fuck up the majority
Of niggas lookin hard at me, I Port 'em like Authority
And when my nigga Meth shine
Out the inner How High mobile rollin three dimes at a time
(Redman and Method Man still... "hiiiigh hiiiiiiiiigh")
It's that Jersey representer
Get hit from the bottom to your head when you enter

 Word...

 Just do what ya feel and never follow (repeat 3X)
Funk Doc break it down


Hah.. yo, suck my dick out of animosity
The velocity will fly that head and freeze yo' camps like pottery
To give lobotomies to all you rap colonies
And shut your million dollar investment, to economy
And possibly might be the one in black leather
Name tag sayin "Caution when wet by the track wetter"
The hash spreader, I love the grimy shit
Even my girl did grimy shit to me and I went back with her
Three years for carrying a loaded handgun
But it's forever when a nigga  and he lands one
To your cranium
That red dot on your forehead it's not cause you Arabian
(Yo watch you say to him!)
You caught up in a tight situation
I should start erasin your whole organization for makin
Wack tunes while my whole platoon rock the basement
You couldn't come close if I gave you my booking agent
Or producer, royalty points twelve shot loaded Luger
Even a crowd to get you souped up - you're still wack
I peel caps, on the regular
Destroy MC's et cetera, creep like The Predator
Fuck you, your label moms and yo' editor
Give you two to the jugular, blood be spreadin
All on my shirt, the king of the flirt, shittin
Bitches hit me off more than New Edition
(Tweet-tweet-tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet-tweet-tweet)
I make them pigs heart skip a beat from the steel physique
So Iron Lung (one me gun done)
Get on the mic and break em off a sumthin sumthin


We moonshine and grow crops
Purchasin the handhelds with the sho' shots, it got me spittin
These slugs at my competition, in rap sessions
U-A-P ain't got no weapon, you live professin
Next in, line, parental discretion advised
These explicit, street linguistics
Better than yo' momma biscuits, we bomb shellin
I might know but ain't tellin, too bad you missed it
Johnny, Dangerously Blaze another enemy made another due paid
Color-safe bleach so I don't fade
Scar your mental with my double edged blade, razor sharp
Get yo' bandaids hold that
Like E said, Get the Bozack
Show them wack niggas where the do's at
On the case like I'm Kojak
Kissin the grits on that Flo bitch
Flip scripts take LOOONG shits - Raider Ruckus
One, I come with premeditated redrum
Gingivitis to your filthy ass gums
Bottom line either get down or get done
Motherfucker




Yo, this is a Wu-Banger two thousand and one noise maker
Off the hook guerilla anthem
This is DJ Kay Slay, from around the way
And I'll smack the shit outta ANY OF YOU DJ's
That front on this shit.. think I'm playin?

 (x2)
I heard you ladies got them thangs thangs, do you really?
I heard y'all niggas like to bang bang, do you really?


I never been a fan of the fame, I got love for the game
Never lust for the dames, I got dust in my veins
Little off in the brain, kid talks butter slang
Sniffed a little blow with the rap Eddie Kane
Spent a lot of dough, it's so hard to explain
And I fucked a lot of hoes off the strength of the name
Wu-Tang, see me at the next, X Winter Games
Snowboardin down a ski range, it's a blue and grey frame
Keep, pointin the finger, I'm that nigga to blame
The main reason why you tuck the chain
Self proclaimed, got a lotta profit to gain
And I'm leavin the rap game the same way I came


Now creep with me, as I roll through the Stat
Little Meth got my back, so do Pinky Fat-Fat
Let me hit that {*inhale*} contact, learn how to act
Before you bring that drama the end; now fade to black
Positive, hate kids who tell me lies
Despise guys that wanna get high but never buy
Got nine lives, nine wives that don't listen
Bitchin their biological clocks is tickin
Wu limited edition - hot off the presses
I guess it's, curtains for competition
Method, runnin 'em out, gun in my mouth
The kid your momma warned you about, tear down the house
After midnight, eatin MC's, change to a gremlin
You're tremblin, behind the Kremlin wall, surrenderin
That's what you get for Russian/rushin, in the direction I was bustin
Polish your sword, your shit is rustin

 (x2)
I heard you ladies got them thangs thangs, do you really?
I heard y'all niggas like to bang bang, do you really?


One-two, testin, testin, mic check wreckin
Steps into the session
Automatic weapon off safety, don't play me
But brings all them things with silencers
My clan is liver than your average '85er
Strive to stay alive
I play for keeps in the streets
Cause it's real on the battlefield
Shells hit the ground from the steel
Bullets travel, sun set fire to your mind
Words combine when I rhyme to free the blind
Prepare my queen for battle and walk down
I drink from the wine of violence, no tolerance
Gave word bond, sword silence
Me in military fatigues, bulletproof underneath
Buy enough ammunition to round and sweep the streets
Of Brooklyn, central, sugar-whipped the rental
While I'm lickin out the window at y'all, fuck y'all

 (x2)
I heard you ladies got them thangs thangs, do you really?
I heard y'all niggas like to bang bang, do you really?


Yo, we thrive on street life, we strive to eat right
They blind and need sight, we tried to be nice
They talk the small talk, we walk the long walk
We lost, they all thought, they forced to fall short
We rock for hard rocks, rocked the hot blocks
Shop and cop rocks, watch the top notch in action
Begin to make your head spin
Wu-Tang my brethren, we bang like veterans
They paid for record spins, taste the medicine
Or face the double M, we came to trouble them
Hustle them for they 20 mill' then buckle them
'Nuff to spin out the blue, bitches lovin them
Dozen men with force of a hundred-ten
Stumblin thug passions, it must've been

 (x4)
I heard you ladies got them thangs thangs, do you really?
I heard y'all niggas like to bang bang, do you really?




My team be bellyaching hungry niggas on the swarm again
Piranha nig bite dick, yo son, it's on again
What up? He made a move, try to assist it
Listen kid yo, you was born to be a pawn but I'm a bishop
Back to the novel, yo Son, it's logical
How you figure God? What? Flow on the track, flip the obstacle
Now my proposal rips the global
From California to courts, it's over God told taste the soul food
Remember baggy jeans, the Timberlands in November
Shorty called me Santa in December
But guess what, my Wally's got messed up
Autograph pressed up what, blessed enough to blow your rest up
We scrape that, Land O' Lake that, Mazola rap
Will get you sent back, represent the gentlemens who bent that
Flash medallions like Italians, la costra nostra
We moving through your hood like we supposed to
Flexing, Lexi Diamonds hold the settlement
To keep the bust your gun boo like that bad ass bitch in Dead Presidents
Ad on the billboard store, check it now, you get the gold dick award
It's like jail and it's the sixth floor
Test me, floating in the S.E., now let's see
Half of y'all niggas built your vine from my stress tree
Faggots, homos, yo, my flavor liver than adobo
Stay militant kid, twist ya like Bolo
You fucking idiot, playing with my Clan but you be fearing it
Fake one, I'm guaranteed to make you take one
Please, y'all niggas money's getting low
But could you come back though, set up shop and get the fat glow?
Tired of y'all, mostly inspired by y'all
So what the deal now, link up with us or put your shield down
Faggot (bitch), you fuck around punk (seven fifteen)
We battle for cream nigga


You want a pound crab? Nah let his hand swing
I ought to punch a hole in his palm with these pointy ass rings
No more said, knew your chump ass was dead
When I saw the .44 reflecting off your shiny forehead
It's Wu-Tang nigga, ain't nothing changed nigga
Still 'Shame on a Nigga', who tried to run game
Your version of perversion, fucking bitches on Persian rugs
Washing niggas like detergent, it's the surgeon
Slugs propels from Bobby Steele's 12 gauge front page "Daily Chronicle" reads
"Hell up in Gotham, take heed and protect your seeds"
You fall like autumn leaves, you lack tranquillity
In your rap utilities to fuck with the abilities
Race like a sperm cell to the ovary
Microphone post tone like a rotary phone, ancient poems of poetry Old scrolls, explosive head bullets, black hooded, Timberland footed ninjas
With 'Full Metal Jacket' clips and know how to put it in you
Surrender your goods and your merchandise for no purchase price, I'm certainly a heist for your ice and curtains and vice
Come quietly, Wu-Tang Clan rules society
Because of variety, so maintain your high anxiety
And lead them to defy me, diary, ya Irie? ...
I need 18 points for my next joint, this high anointed king
To make a deal, I be the one to appoint
Steve Rifkind must have been sniffing
To catch something so dope, it left Monica Lynch pussy dripping
I fuck hundreds of bitches and split millions of dollars
And built with thousands of scholars
My life saga from the hill to the harbor, legal kid brown in Nicaragua
Gave birth to MCs, thieves and bank robbers
We drove expensive whips and took worldwide trips
And my dick's been sucked by the finest lips
Fancy delicatessens and the world's best refreshment
But none of the above compare to the one-twenty lessons
Or my queen and my seeds in the home that I rest in
Enter my zone get blown in 99 sections


This rhyme has no limitation, this time there's no hesitation
Collecting minds at the door
You want it niggas it's yours, the flavors raw
What the fuck you think I'm flowing for? It's rhyme and reason
Bite the bullet, niggas is fowl and it's duck season
We at odds till we even motherfucker
Bad asses, high times, lower classes
Taste mine, straight shots in dirty glasses
Bring it to him, room service, under pressure
And mad nervy, waving guns at the clergy
Ticallion, we ain't worried, keep them sick niggas 7-30
Picture this, watch the birdy
These Bastards is Ol' and Dirty, with sharp hymns
That be stabbing you, pins and needles, needles and pins
'Nough said, dick in your mouth like Tempest Bled'
As I race track with thoroughbreds, ducking the Feds


Yo, my ice look fly upon the keyboard son
Niggas ran up on me lord, praising what we do by the laws
That's right, exile the fake, hit them niggas like weight
Feed 'em food, let the fake evaporate
Reconstruction, that's the whole science on my, production
Y'all niggas guess who stuck son, left his nuts hung
Switch, finger itch, staring at you like a bitch
Maybe y'all niggas snitched
You's a loner, Adidas shell top while I
Sip a Corona, read the Robb Report, then bone her
Buy you some jewels, here's some food
Not necessarily mean to be rude boo, check out the analoo
We in the mushrooms, chased the high neck in the custom
Baggy jeans, thick ropes god, sliding through customs
Chill, y'all niggas know what time it is
James Bond beamers behind me on Bacardi Limon
Check out the pitch like Nolan Ryan, he caught a slug for lying
Yeah you was lying, where's the cash, crying
Militia, rolling in position
Casa Blanca Cuban Link Christian
Lex retali' back whistling fake fucks {*echoes*}




(There...there?)
One more game
Yo, uh huh uh huh
Staar
Surround sounder, blunt smokin, remy downer
Hip-hop sizzar slingin my raw in your flounder
You get skidawed, undertakin' undergrounders
This lyricist, lounge with low, that be lounger
Aliens is out of townish, fuck applause
Niggas clap now with forty pounders, and fourty-fours
Is it all, fair in love with war
Young 'uns with guns, acting like they taking yours, uh
Live by the sword, they gonna die by the sword, uh
My vocal cords break the laws that apply to nature
Low and these niggas love to hate ya
Request the henney straight no chaser
Twin towerin' I skyscrape ya
Now gimme yours


Trifled disciple, arch rival reppin with weapons that homicidal
Star leaves you marked from the start like tribal scars
(Allah punk) I'm hazardous as a bomb and arms spinnin' like Christ
Recitin' psalms in the streets of Babylon
(Verbs I gather well) ??? data shells
My squad camoflauge your wealth
Like the bible with parabels
With the navigator, spittin razor sharp, breath laser data
That'll tickle you now, but sway you later


On this one call me Lee Major
Million dollar man, bionic or proffesor chronic
Still not a player, I just fuck alot the panty raider
Get shortys mad, they curse you wild on your sky pager
Stankin' ass


Yo Mr. Big Mouth, better duck down or bite the bullet
You niggas got guns but you scared to death to pull it
Bet if I pull my gun I'm gon' squeeze
I'm startin at your head, son, and stoppin' at your knees
I hate your screwmugs, rumble counterfeit thugs
Niggas want mine, bet they come and get it in blood
Fat potential, gave birth to a corrupt mental
Foul thoughts paralyzin temples, it's just that simple

Chorus

You better come with your best gun
Niggas be holdin', it's all war no fun
Niggas be bowlin', you niggas under pressure now
My squads down for whatever with whoever now
Let's get it on
Best to come with your best gun
Niggas be rollin', it's all war no fun
Niggas be holdin', you niggas under pressure now
My squads down for whatever with whoever now
Let's get it on


Arm leg shots to hit the spot like a four fifth Glock
We got this hip-hop shilock and all you clique got
Was lip lock, heavy heat, steady street sweepin your peeps
Hawks, machete chops puttin' cease to your petty fleets
This raw rebel got more metal than pop
And rock groups, when my Glock shoots the scores settled
A ground attack, I'm bound to clap rounds of rap
Clowns are found flat, face down around the map
Simple minds, cripple smiles, my rhymes are four five
The size oh two nines combine, can't even tickle mine


I told you once, I told your ass a thousand times, chump
Body in the trunk, stay in line punk
Fuck wit me and mine


Yo
You be the actual, sixteen bars, comin' after you
Never go against my team, they might embarrass you
Slit-slang terrorist talk, fully armed
Put your hands up, I'mma put a hole in your paws
Ruin your side show, eyes low, brains fried from hydro
Two choices, bass off or either die slow
We all scholars when it's time to clean a dirty dollar
Attack the boards, it's like a rotweiler


Niggas comin out they shoes like they Usher
These motherfuckers on the run, and they socks from
The bounty hunter, Iron Lungster, rain and thunder
Here come the lightning now I'm strikin' back at niggas bitin'
Pushin' buttons just to step away from self-destruction
Inch and a half away from touchin' somethin'
Suckin' away from bustin'
Yall brothers laugh now and cry later
I rap from Alpha to Omega, sixty four to Sega
Whoopin' that ass, walk you dogs through the lookin' glass
Been burnin' MC's since cookin' class
Makin' it hot like the summer in the crackspot
With blacktops, my nickle slot, triple bar, hit the jackpot
On each block, I'm the remedy, send them back to me
After detock, shorty got knuckles in the Reebok
Plus we got a problem with the Benz
(What's the problem with the Benz)
She want the six-hundred, but she ain't got the ends

Chorus

You better come with your best gun
Niggas be holdin', it's all war no fun
Niggas be bowlin', you niggas under pressure now
My squads down for whatever with whoever now
Let's get it on




Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, to the Roller Coaster Malpractice
Please stay seated, yeh, and hold on even FUCKIN tighter now

FUCKIN BLEEDIN Ti-FUCKIN-tanic!!
And it's called the Heart Attack Mountain;
Which we feel is self-explanatory ("Stop stop stop stop!!")


Yo, I know the streets is watchin'
Dirty date niggas cock-blockin' and plottin'
Waitin' for my downfall, Street got options
Fuck y'all, y'all can ball, I'mma stay rockin
All emcee's paused when they heard the album's droppin
Nuttin but the hottest hip-hop rap concoction
Rap's in a state of emergency, it's shockin'
I produce, joints that loosen up the socket
Crowd surf through the mosh pit on some rock shit
Bang your head to this, pump your fist if you feelin' it
Wild the fuck out, bust a clip for the fuck of it
This is as good as it get, who you rollin' with? (You)
Who the ultimate? (Wu)
Stay committed, sold my soul to this rap shit (nigga)
Slow your roll, strike a bowl, you get clapped quick
I roll with, ghetto bastard with biscuits
And grab my dick and flick it, get the picture


Hold on..
{DT}: This is Dr. Trevis, comin to y'all motherfunkers live
Hold on, hold on..
{Adam F}: The Roller Coaster Malpractice! ("Stop stop stop stop!!")


Yo, yo, yo
I cop a new Benz, crash the front
So hard the airbags use nasal pumps
Jump out, cock the shottie (raise 'em up!)
I stomp holes like the ground ain't paved enough
Inform the former the first step was a warm-up
The next step'll bomb on where your car alarm was
Chikens that'll run in, burn the barn up
Shots'll tear ya Sean John and Phat Farm up (nev-ah!)
I never got a Soul Train award (nev-ah!)
Never lost to emcee's as lame as y'all (nev-ah!)
Trick a bitch car payment off
I'm a orangutang when the chain is off nigga
I set-trip, and I slowly blas
With a axe, and a pump, and a goalie mask
Leavin, stains of blood on your Roley glass
When I'm, in your hood nigga throw me bags


Hold on..
{DT}: You've just been hit, with the ultimate hardcore shit
Hold on, hold on.. {motherfucker}
{Adam F}: The Roller Coaster Malpractice! ("Stop stop stop stop!!")


Let's trip the night fantastic
I'm flexible, they used to call me plastic
These big butt bitches get they ass kicked
It is what it is, shittin' on y'all kids
Couldn't live where we live
I can't be defeated like "Nobody Beats the Wiz"
Like, when daddy's home can't nobody beat the kids
Right? You know the Clan and you know the fuckin man
Meth rock a mic without a kickstand
Two blunts, and razors in his wristband
Slap you and your bitch man
Lookin in your lobby, call me stick-man
When it's goin down, call me quicksand
Zero to sixty in a second, pack a Smith & Wesson
And if the price is right, you can be the next contestant
For this aggression, no question, M-E to the F
And be flexin as hard as my erection
Kid learn your lesson cuz what if I decide to start testin
Your joint - end the motherfuckin session


Hold on..
{DT}: This is the final moment, where you motherfuckers bout to die
Hold on, hold on.. {yo}
{Adam F}: The Roller Coaster Malpractice! ("Stop stop stop stop!!")


Yo, yo - let a nigga get into it
Lubricate y'all veins with this "Do-It" fluid
I Einstein the rymes, spit them thangs to prove it
Cross with the Mack, in fact, my game's the truest
Now I'm on the highway, doin it my way
With Street, Illegal, Meth, Roc, and Doc Friday
Performin like the weather was warm
And drop heat on the streets through zero degree storms
And keep the ghetto, pop your metal
Smoke it like a cigarette till ya optic yellow
The addiction, ain't no friction
I got them rap heads fillin out a prescription, with diciton
Gettin thick when I put fire to the steaks
And burn the odds, like a iron to your face
These long hard years spent Oxy-Cleanin
Make it clear - look out, Big 'Sauks is here, nigga what?


Hold on..
{DT}: This is Dr. Trevis, warnin y'all motherfuckers
Hold on, hold on..
{Adam F}: The Roller Coaster Malpractice! ("Stop stop stop stop!!")
Hold on, hold on..
{DT}: PPP Def Squad, we lock shit down
Hold on, hold on..
{Adam F}: The Roller Coaster Malpractice! ("Stop stop stop stop!!")



"Everybody just scream!"


Gilla House, aiyo, Meth, nigga? (What up?)
Aiyo, Keith Murray, nigga, pass the muthafucking weed, nigga
{Meth, got that joint} (Nah, you got that shit, nigga, stop playing)
You know how I do when I come in the muthafucking building, man
Redman, nigga

"Everybody just scream!"


Call your moms on the phone, it's the jam
I got jet ski's that ride over land
Since a young buck had fire in my hands
When I was bumping "Roxanne, Roxanne"
I got gin and an O.J
Rock 'friday' to 'next friday' like O'Shea
Hit the west coast, six four on tray
Doctor Bombay, sick flow all day
I don't play fair, niggas can't see me
That's why I make it do what it do, baby, yeah
You want some, yeah, niggas hit the floor
When I kick in the door, wave in the four four
For sure, Uncle Snoop, where's the coupe?
Cuz I keep a ho fighting like New York and Hoopz
Strap up your boots, move around
Pick it up like engine number nine
It's mine, homey, Tech, what's good?
And it ain't hard to tell how I rep my hood
You a beast like me, rep your hood
Sign the check when I mic check, one-two


West Coast niggas love getting it started
Down South niggas love getting it started
East Coast niggas love getting it started
But when we in the house shit get retarded
When we in the house shit get retarded
When we in the house shit get retarded
We came to finish what ya'll done started
"Everybody just scream!"


Aiyo, fuck your prognosis on who's the dopest
You get skate like super chronic halitosis
If you looking for beef, you know you gon' get it
Got ya'll niggas yellin' 'callin' the cops, get the paramedics'
Keith Murray, Method Man, Redman
Hip hop got Barack in his B-Boy stance
Like a nigga with no legs, you don't stand a chance
Against the Wu-Tang, Def Squad, L.O.D. wardance
One glance, watch Keith Murray hop out
In a hurry, cold like a McFlurry
No Mickey D's, show me the money like Jerry Maguire
L.O.D. for hire, I'm ready
I rep Strong Island, bums get rushed
I pack house like Biggie in Notorious
We warriors, who the fuck are you?
I pop an E and the gun go Pikachu
Niggas know how deep the crew, get at me
I'm nasty, but I went from ashy to classy
Got badunkadunks waving all at me
Cuz I be, doing my thing and making everybody scream




Yo, Brick City, Staten, Long Island, we back
More violent on the track, black talent and a gat
Bomb shit, like a nigga wilding in Iraq
See the truth of the fact, niggas lying in they raps
Me? I'm a diamond in the rough in the cut
Like paroxide, got mine frying in the Dutch
Forget about your top 5, try and top mines
Take shine like I got mine ironing your guts
You know I keep it fired up, fire in the hole
To the game, old and tired, I be tired when I'm old
I'm trying to keep it hot like the pile up in the stove
While these rappers losing power putting powder in they nose
Meth, Keith Murray and Redman, yo
Fuck you and your mama on a headband, ho
You can call the kid a modern day Van Gogh
Take the art to a place where the fake can't go
My chain and my pants hang low
Got my own namebrand, I'm the man made, bro
Cash in advance, I'mma blow up with the dough
Whoa ho ho, don't let me like slow up with flow

Yo, c'mon!
Even if I died a thousand deaths
When I resurrect I'll still be Meth
The jams will still be def
I'm here, me and this mic-phone, we here
And ain't tryin' to hear nothin' cuz we had it up to here
(What?)
Lyrics have no dress code (yeah)
From KRS to Depeche Mode
Kid I'm so cool you catch cold
At the jump off, it's about to jump off
My niggas speak with they hands or the gun talk
Yo RZA, we got the Clan in the front and police at the door
Every exit is laced with C-4 about to blow
Life trial I'm passed out
MC's is like bitches in thongs - they assed out
But me, the M-E-T-H- the O-D
Just too real, I can't be touched and can't feel
The monotony in rap, take a picture of my nut sack
Carbon copy that and send your crew a fax
Motherfucker


New and improved Wu-Tang style
Turn it up now, y'all done fucked up now
Spit flames (Five mics)
Peep game (On site)
Bring the pain (All night)
Off the chain (Damn right)

"It's the Method Man for short Mister Meth"
"Tical-lion"
"Hmmm"


Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, c'mon!
Even if I died a thousand deaths
When I resurrect, through my first born, my name lives on
My words is like a third degree to young emcees
Buzzworthy on your MTV, the Killa Bees
John Jacob, straight up, break up, schemes and plots
Ace up my sleeve, bake up pies in pots
So this is what it's come to (Huh?)
Lickin' shots at them kids that used to punk you (Huh?)
Repetitious rap shit, don't get no air play ya mouth whip
And niggas can't smoke wit' dry lips so chapped
Bite my shit, I'm like Kojack to get my flow back
In fo' flat, I track you down like a low jack
Spy verse spy, eye for an eye can I penalize the uncivilized
Make 'em civilized
You know right from wrong, so know I'm the bomb
Who don't beef for beats, see the tracks on my arm
Motherfucker


New and improved Wu-Tang style
Turn it up now, y'all done fucked up now
Spit flames (Five mics)
Peep game (On site)
Bring the pain (All night)
Off the chain (Damn right)

"It's the Method Man for short Mister Meth"
"Tical-lion"
"Hmmm"


Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, c'mon!

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, c'mon!




To every soldier in the hood, go in
To every real nigga holding, keep your ones on folding
Take it from a ninja and scribe, stay alive
Keep rolling, and keep your guns on swollen


Aiyo, joint loaded, Lotus, big chain cobras
Cloth the certain way, notice
My style's new now, with generals luau, drugs, guns
Chilling on the cool out, don't make me pop you, this is not cool
Guaranteed to give you something that works, you're dumped in the dirt
Shitting up blood, fingers is burnt
Many cycles when you fight in my walls, it's like Michael and the Bulls
See a flying piece of iron, no lying
No fib and no bullshitting, the shines is forbidden
We like Crouching Tiger, you just a fucking kitten
Bout to get that wig re-open and then smoked in
Bitches is watching, snatch you in the open, yo
Twenty-four, seven, we legends, the myth, the riff the gift
Shaolin bounded with more whiff
Clap 'em with them get down boys, we call them the niggas
Who want it with us, we the belt holders in the business




Yo, ay, the streets be calling and shit
A lot of veterans be calling it quits
They be calling my flow ill, but still I'm never calling in sick
This is Meth Man, New York niggas calling me piff
Fuck the cops that be calling me Cliff, flag me down on the Concord
Police dogs all up in my whip
I get cake, women all in mix, they wanna jump in the six
And groupie niggas wanna jump in your flicks
We live the life, Scarfaces and guns, I used to fight for crumbs
Throw an ace, kick the dice and run
Plead your case, you ain't nice as son, I got the drive to win
So where you niggas get your license from?
Bite an ear, Mike Tyson, uh, that means dough and my nose itch
And coke fiends is blowing they noses
My team got cream and you know this
So nigga get yours, before the door to opportunity closes






Yeah... yeah... Allah Math...
Yeah... yo... yo...


Y'all ain't never stopping the kid, why y'all knocking the king?
Would ya like a shot of liquor or like a shot to the rib?
Plus you stay on top of they grills, stay on top of they biz
Thinking niggas plotting on hairs, think they not when they is
This is Staten Island gully, you dig? It's getting ugly
And I ain't found a court that can judge me, the block love me
Like nines to the side of the skully, popping they top
I'd rather pop bubbly, one for B.I.G. and one for Pac
Nigga, trust me, I'm hot as they get, like Al Green
Getting hit by a pot of them grits, yo, nahmeen?
Y'all don't really want no parts of this, soon as a nigga
Start shining, niggas start some shit, my guard lit
Like a boss, head nigga in charge, get in these drawers
Fitted, nine inches bigger than yours
This Meth dude got that food, and he serving it raw
Told you before, I bring the pain, and now I'm hurting them, pa
Hurting them, pa...


Up from the 36, back on that bullshit
Okay, I'm reloaded, strapped with a full clip
Staten Island's the borough, Park Hill, we still click
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, that's the Clan, we run shit


Aiyo, you fucking with some capital G's, Allah Math
Streetlife, Meth Man, plus the Masta and me
Soldier I, make it happen, indeed, my sick gift
Had the highest paid ho, get it cracking for free
Worldwide, still trapped in the P's, Pioneers
Like the twenty inch woofers, that's in back of the V
Leave ya brain, like you spazzing on E
It don't matter who you happen to be, nothing swagger like he
Keep a dirty cop close, never talk with no feds
Tear the roof off the mother, right along with ya head
And I ain't talk unless she talking bout bread
You would swear that I'm rocking New Balance, how I'm walking the ledge
Son, I'm just a little off of the edge, as I stalk
The mean streets, for paused types, callers are read
Killa Hill where the warriors bred, I'm a Resident
Patient, it's gonna take more than the meds




Special invited guest, I came to put the rumors to rest
Rip the rest of the slugs through your chest
Put the chest to the back of your vest
Trap your packet, take the money and jet
Niggas posted, but you posing no threat
Punk, you pussy like the opposite sex
Front, see how many shots you will get
I'm not asking, I'm demanding respect
I'm just a man to respect
Watch your step, son, your funeral's next
Streetlife is the man in the flesh, I got one hand on your neck
The other hand is attached to the tech
Your next move could mean life or death
Make move, take baby steps
Hold that thought, nigga, save your breath
We hold courts, in the streets, we rep
For Cash Rule, and we came to collect, cock sucker






So wavy, so elegant, gyeah


Movining like they just evicted me, pulled up in that foreign got them niggas sick of me
Feds in the projects I heard that they was taking pics of me, Nas co-signed it, no Versace, rockin' HSTRY
This shit here, it should go down in history, We had them bundles ask you uncle he was tryna sniff for free
Niggas tired rob me turned into a fucking mystery, Trappin' 'til I got like 50 thousand on the wrist of me
Mixin' Cris with weed I'm flippin', dippin' from Ds, Scriptures tatted on us from Bibles we had to read
You movin' not half my speed, you got a little buzz, all I got a little cuz that'll kill you if you laugh at me
Ain't nothin' funny we bout this money come check the bank statement
Every months we on vacation, we cake chasing, No patience nigga I hate waiting, AKs quick and I heard you rat and seen the statement (rat! Dave East)
I just want to be free, I just want to be free
I just want to be free, I just want to be free


Moving like they just evicted me
Moving like they just evicted
Moving like they just evicted
Moving like they just evicted
Moving like they just evicted me


Moving like they just evicted me
Crossin' state lines and got this canine sniffin' me
I think they heard it through the grapevine, snitchery
Straight shottas, (blow!) Wu-Tang is for the pickney
Sentence me either the pen or the penitentiary, you pealing to the court, 'cause you done caught a quarter century
Potentially it's manslaughter if you mention me I tell you how it is and then I tell you how it's meant to be
Twisting up a tree, y'all buzzing because of me Misery loves company y'all ain't bugging, it's bugging me
Finna be no Sympathy they playing in the post, I'm just sayin' ain't no playin' with a GOAT, you must be kiddin' me
And I ain't gigglin' I'm about my chicken, I mean I'm Louis Rich
Hammer Time when I start spittin' I'm too legit
If I'm in the kitchen Wu in the mix, whip cream, tires clean I'm so cool in the whip





Moving like they just evicted me
Streets had me seeing karma like epiphanies
Life clearer like them diamonds up in Tiffany's
 got the ghettos hotter then rotisseries
I just  with the piffery
5th o' Henny, couple semis, try and diss at me
Young, I swear to god I been through it
Chef told focus on your dreams and pursue it
Yup I'm spittin' nothing but that fluid
Polluted water to your borders yo there's nothin' to it
I'm Hans  meth lab yo its nothin' to it
Mr. Barker gotten me sharper under Method's toolage
Ya got in to a st and no homie backed him
Type to smile and celebrate it when them niggas clapped 'em
You cowards phony we don't even dap 'em
Staying sucker free to sucker shit is the anthem


I just wanna be free
I just wanna be free
I just wanna be free
I just wanna be free


Moving like they just evicted me, tryna get off like a nigga just restricted me
This shit here, is just what I precipitated B, now we innovating, celebrating our victory
Niggas they used to doubt us, went from misery to history
Beaucoup signing, I'm the singe, the epiphany
Homie must be shittin' me, why the fuck you kiddin' me frontin' for the lens but on the low your bitch keep hittin' me
While I lay up in the Benz, working what I spent tryna get it back mama need back, show me the money
I don't need no new friends juts a few ends and a couple real niggas


I just wanna be free
I just wanna be free
I just wanna be free
I just wanna be free


Movin' like they just evicted me
Movin' like they just evicted
Movin' like they just evicted
Movin' like they just evicted
Movin' like they just evicted me



Intro: Method Man

Spark that shit up
And lets fly
Oh my people
Heyyy Ohhhh
Ahhhh Hooooo
Eiiii Heyyy

Verse One: Sticky Fingaz

I'm a hoodlum
My dick and a gun is what I'm holding
Sporting mad Polo but only if it's stolen
I got no morals my mind is in the gutter
Kid I'll open up your face with my orange box cutter
Soak you when you least expect it
Before I met Russel I only had a jail record
And nothing ever hurt me when I was at home
These evil streets got a mind of their own
My pops left me for dead with just the clothes on my back
I grew up selling crack
And learning to drive in a car jack
I got street smarts and I use intuition
I can spot an undercover with my x-ray vision
And if anybody trynna' test me out there
They gonna make me kill them and throw away my career
I'm my mothers first born, her last bad seed

Verse Two: Sonsee

Its all about the next caper
The cocaine, props and acres
For the sake ah
Snatchin the green paper
Me and my crew roll in the zone of the twilight
The news highlight
When the next shit don't go right
Its so tight its blazing
A nigga squeezed hayz in
Got 'em geezing for a runner
Then the plot thickens
On point like Rod Strickland
Clocks ticking
Makes the hardest niggas clicks stop ticking
Hitting they stash
And murdering like and expert
Cover ya tracks
And conceal that dirty shit

Chorus: P.I

This is for the gun slingers
Noise bringers
This is for the crack slingers
Bell ringers
This is for the bootleggers
And everyday beggers
And all my hood hustlers who know where we headin'

Repeat 2X

Verse Three: Fredro Starr

Its all about the $50,000 cars
Dice games and ice chains
We out of the average niggas price range
Rings and Remy mixed with Henny
Chicks with Fendi sucking disk in the Infinity
This nigga had mad deco
Fucking petro the nickel metro Blow
All you heard was the gun echo
On a dead nbight I get my head right
Running red lights no headlights
Pumping Buddah in a black Benz
Pulling out Mac 10's
Its just the smell of fucking cigarettes
Broke niggas with assed out
Took 2 puffs and passed out
Woke him up with 21 shots of penicillin
Amped him up
I guess thought it was hempacillin
Yo chill kid lamp kid, chill kid you livin'
Aye yo JB hit me one time

Verse Four: Method Man

Its the Blaze that be Johnny
Not many shots can do that ass raunchy
Lyric to the muzak we rolling
Watch out for the niggas that be holding
Raunchy fucking up your colon
Of course its Tical
Verbal assault
We can walk these dogs through all 5 boroughs of New York
Some talk
While other individuals walk
In my square tryin' to hide thoughts
Spreading lies in my ears
Got me questioning my peers
That be show and prove they don't belong here
I be the Chef in Hells Kitchen
Pop in the clip and hit the DJ if the records skipping
My competition gotta keep me at arms distance
I know myself onion head niggas don't listen
I shoot the what
Got no time for that wiz bitchin'
I'm about to blow in 5 seconds
The clocks ticking consider this another mission
Impossible as he gets hostile
Uncut blowing up your nostril
We There
Come on take another if you dare
The reason why its so raw cause its real
I swear by the hairs on my Chin Chiggy Chin
To the day I die I represent the Grimy niggas
The ones who can't afford Tommy Hillfigger
The down and dirty Johnny fill Niggas

Yeah

Chorus 2X






Yeah...
Time to let these niggas know Son
Niggas don't even wanna motherfuckin understand
KnowhatI'msayin? Time to hit em with the third degree
Yeah you know the QBC, here to drop a G
Yo...


Look into the eyes, True Lies, your whole click despise
Especially me, H-A-V-O-C
Don't want your chick, cuz she's burning third degree
Plus you snitchin, you ain't got no ties on me
I keep it strong, while you scream word is bond
Lying through your teeth swearing on your first born
Your word is weak, dont hold no weight in this
Hit you up quick strictly shit that I'm livin in
You walk a line that's thin, you religious well you sin
Fuckin with the Mobb, Infamous to the end


I hold a nine Ruger, with an infa-spot disc
Red dot right at your face, so set sail or rock it
And kept drivin, pull off like the Indy 5 G
In a four time Ford truck with Speed
Like the motion picture, this nigga Gone With the Wind
My crime work, ninja style shit was did
And got away with, escaped it, the Jakes from tracing
Anything that lead to the source, you know the boss
Of the Mobb killing, is like an Unsolved Mystery
Puzzling, nobody knows, it's all history
Madness amongst me, I frequently have to get thugly
Never fails it's always something
No rest, daily gotta rock my vest
I shoot at your best man yeah your MVP
He played the front line got struck down immediately
I wave a Mobb Deep flag, you hear the sound as it slaps wind
Heavy load my military hold ammunition
Far from animation, it's real live, you think not
My crew, kings of New York, who taking your spot
I put the green light on, your whole click, Island shit
Running through the whole house wilding, extorting

(Extortion, hit that up, extortion, hit that up)


Extortion is the key I got the key for extortion
Spend your fortune, dead your shorty like abortion
Take precaution, Infamous laws enforced in
You married to the Mobb, kid take it then divorce it
Cause I ain't got no time for them domestic disputes
If you scared get a dog don't got a clique then recruit
You're weak troop, lost battalion in the mist
On your name I shit, take it like a man you little bitch


I blaze yo britches, P.L.O. extortion, you forcin
The hand that rocks the cradle, caution before you enter
This Shaolin representer, carry thirty-six deadly shits
You fuckin with, top contenders
Official to the bone gristle
It don't matter if you bust rhymes or bust pistols
Remember me, burn a nigga to a third degree
Don't act familiar motherfuckers you ain't heard of me
Just peep the stee and the rap how it's supposed to be
Tap the pockets bag the goods like a grocery, we food-shoppin
On top of that we hip-hoppin, and don't stoppin
Out-of-state drawers-droppin, the panty-raiders
Slide on ya like gators, umped that stank bitch back out
And then played her, but that ain't nothin
Crossin this dog walkin, native New York and
Shaolin slang talkin, rap nigga
Mr. Freeze crowd shiver
What? Young, black, and don't give a fuck
If the next crew get the scissor...

(Extortion, extortion, give that up kid, extortion)

Bottom line, what the fuck you wanna do
You eyin me, at the same time I'm eyin you, punk
Wanna pop the most junk
Be the same motherfucker with the most lumps
Chew on that shit
Punk faggot (word up)
Burn his ass like a book of matches

Under pressure like fat bitches...

Fall out, yeah, I'm going all out (hold on)
Hold on, man, what's really going on (I'm coming)
And when I'm coming, a hundred miles & running (keep back)
Keep back, y'all ain't got it like that (fall out)


Here we go again, herb-smoke, blowing in the wind
Cops chasing, wanna throw him in the pen
And the day he leave the game, yo, he going in the Benz
On them 24's looking like he rolling on the rims
All daying, knawimsayin', I'm staying up to par, parleyin'
While y'all hating, I'm splitting this cigar
Man, it's nathan, all y'all do is aim and start spraying
Cuz tonight's the night, and me and my niggas ain't playing (keep back)
Y'all done did it now, another critic kicked Tical
Alotta niggas mad cuz I ain't fold like they figure, now
Let me put my fitted down
*hwak*
Spit around
Listen when this hit the ground, y'all gon' hear the difference now
Here I got that miracle, sickest individual
Flow that's so original, see this is what they meant to do
It's not an act, it's all actual fact
The kid is back, making tracks, catch panic attacks, and fall

 (2x)


Aww shit, ain't this about a bitch
I give a fuck about a bitch, I'm more about a grip
And I'm all that a nigga got, the more he gotta get
Feeling like a million dollars, buyin' million dollar shit (keep back)
What y'all dealing with, one shot killing it
Stop changing my style, when y'all stop stealing it
Meth is chillin' like milk top killing
If it ain't got no real in it, I'm probably not feeling it (keep back)
I'm deadin' ya kids, and burn another blizz
What it is, what it is, Wu-Tang is for the kids
So niggas please, why y'all puffin' them trees
I'm damaging M.C.'s, oxygen, they can't breathe, fall

 (2x)




I'm sayin, you-could-you could just come over top of that shit...
Did I hear it?
Nigga and bang your head, PUNK!!

 *in background repeating*
SUCK A DICK!!! 6x
SUCK MY DICK!!!


And it don't, it don't, it don't, it don't, it don't, it don't
It don't, it don't, it don't, it don't stop!
It all starts wit the pad and pen, shall we begin
To burn bush in this rap session, once again
On the run be the Black Stallion
Now you fuckin wit Ticallion, hmmm
Iron Lung, boy me can done, army of one, blaze yo' bun
I'mma get you none, accept challenge AHH!
Run a mile wit a racist, they iced it, I aced it
Placed it, right up in their face till they faced it
Hard to the dome like a chrome microphone
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bad to the bone to the bone
Danger zone, that's my life and my song
Keep it movin, hop along little doggies!


Uh uh uh, FUCK YOU!!!
Drive The Mack Cadillac
Dark shade the window all sunny and black
Pitch antenna back of the car
Inside is a TV, even a bar
Bulletproof down, safe and sound
Chauffeur in the FRONT just to drive the Lexus all around
Give ya, give ya, give ya body a ride, nice and warm inside
Come to the Dirt Dog as the tummy rise
*Laughs* Enter


Yo yo my Wu-Tang cliff'll make your atom split
The power of my brain, you can't fathom it
Whoever go against the will of the grain will get slain
Don't EVER say thy God name in vain
My third eye electronic dragonfly spiral observe
Can record your words
And your lies and approach you
And have my Dogs come and Ghost you
When it comes to the bread son, the heat will toast you


Music makes me lose control
This is not just rock and roll
Hip hop digs right to the soul
Music makes me lose control
Wu-Tang, now we on a roll
On a rise, now here we go
Guaranteed to flip the show
RZA beats is outta control
Outta control, outta control, outta control
Outta control, now here we go


Yo who got that nigga gassed like he can't get skimasked
Abducted from his doorstep
Dufflebag his head for the price of nothin
He's a glutton
What I'm manifestin each day is a lesson
Ya'll faggots, came to the School of the 36 Chambers
Copied on papers of scholars that earn dollars
We trendsetters in Wu leathers, trendsetters in Wu leathers, whatever

Chorus  2x
Music makes me lose control
This is not just rock and roll
Hip hop digs right to the soul
Music makes me lose control
Wu-Tang, now we on a roll
On a rise, now here we go *Skip next line on the second time of chorus*
Music makes me lose control (2x)

Guaranteed to rip the show
RZA beats is outta control
Outta control, outta control, outta control
Now here we go




I wanna deal with a bigger asshole
The streets, it's coming down hard
We got to get our shit together
We always had music, eating off the game
Like you was never gon' run dry, that ain't no business
No other game is run so disorganized
Look around you, every hood that's taking care of business
Is together, dig it, tight


I can't spend my life running away
For what it's worth, how much dirt can I get done in a day
I got, clip in the AK, a blunt in the tray
I'm a beast, fuck the police, N.W.A
Ya'll play this game that the huster's play
And if you dress in the metrosexual way, then muthafucka, you gay
Ya'll can save this drama for Kay Slay, like who's fucking my chick
Or writing books about sucking my dick
Now I don't give a fuck what they say, cuz once I put on my cool
They see my life and wanna put on my shoes
Top of the world, ma, look at your dude
I dig a chick with an attitude, but I don't let her cook up my food
It's like these young niggas hugging the strip
Who got the power to move bricks and buildings never loving the bitch
Stripping with game, ya'll can guzzle a sip, ain't nothing change
My niggas is off the chain, and we don't muzzle the pit, a-ha


Soon as I, pick up my pen, I begin my flow
I close my eyes then write rhymes in a Blackout mode
My uzi, weigh over a ton, CD plays over
I do my crime with baking soda, with no odor
Pull out like boat motor streams, crack your shoulder wing
Def Squad decoder ring, psychopath bordering
My dogs shitting on your lawn, while you watering
Pay the fine, audit him and shit on your lawn again
D.O.C. get it, C.O.D., my hood
P.O.P., nigga, N.J. deep, baby
Jersey state of mind, Method Man, lock 'em in
Ya'll niggas give a fuck, punk, we the opposite, yup
I hear you gossipping, cuz we on
Just because I rock, don't mean I'm made of stone
My bones is sturdy, I wake up to get it early
When I bully the streets, my Co-D is Keith Murray
In a hurry, back down, the boy roll with us
This how it sound when them boys is transmitted
Bricks to Staten Island, where babies turn into killers
That's why my Cadillac bare more arms than caterpillers, let's get it




Turn the track up a little bit
We need to rock in here

I wanna make you happy


I'm not at all happy or elated, this category ain't my favorite
It's my story, I'mma state it, you could love it or hate it
I'm just a misfit blessed with good dick and intelligence
Hood nigga holding no grudges on petty shit
I started, why are we cold-hearted, so guarded
Scared to get hurt, trying not to love the hardest
That's garbage, remember when we loved each other
Bathtub scrubbed each other, chillin', champagne spillin'
Uh, feelin' like the shit gon' last forever
Time went so fast, we had a blast together
Laughs we had, friends we spent time with
Now I be seeing your friends out, then I'm reminded
How we all used to gather up for the holidays
Now your friends all nervous to speak, they act afraid
I was your bestie, how it get to this
As I reminisce, takin' off my MJs in my empty crib
Mary...


I wanna make you happy
But you just don't see it
I wanna be around, babe
But I'm so tired of competing
We say all the wrong things
Till we make each other cry
What are we doing?
Will it ever get better?
My heart, my soul
I gave, it's yours
I can't get back
All the things that I lost
Boy, I love you
But you're pushing me away


I gave you everything that I got
Watched my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside


Now I was hoping
We'd get through this together
You said you'd love me
Through all types of stormy weather
Wasn't it you who said
We'd be together for all time
But it keeps messing with my mind
My heart, my soul
I gave, it's yours
I can't get back
All the things that I lost
I need you here near me
But I can't make you stay




I never thought that I would have this feeling
Do you think for once that you can truly mean it
Wasting so much time disagreeing
See, I'm to the point where I don't know what I believe in




If you don't want this, I don't want this, I do my morning crunches
Play my jazz, pray to the east, and watch the sunset
Uh, but yet I was blowin' you up the other night
Could tell your girl was telling you what to write back
Tell me why it's like that


So make up your mind, boy decide
We can't go on like this, this ain't right (it ain't right)
Feeling really bad, feeling kinda low
Think it's time to go






Feelings. The emotional side of a man, woman or a child's character. A response or tendency to respond. A belief, which can be vague, illogical, but mostly, irrational


I never gave a fuck on how the next nigga felt
I rocked a heavyweight belt cause that's the way I felt
Still feel, so inspired to write a rhyme that's ultimately
No other emcee could get with me, is way I felt
Don't forget the first time you heard me rhyme the way
The first time you heard "Protect Ya Neck", the way you felt
Like no other hip hop record ever made you felt
Cards dealt, played my handle, when no matter how I felt


Every time we touch the mic, you know our lyrics is felt
Worldwide, live, polaroid shit, all my homies is
And we ride out to all of our music is
Yeah, we gets busy, teach the youth  because we know how it felt
Give em Knowledge of self expressing in a way that it's felt
So each and every person to recognize what they felt
Watch your mind state because the evil could be felt
You never know, how when I first came out, how my brothers felt
I've been going through it, plus a lot of deep pain was felt
We would last for a night, but a better tomorrow


I felt the angel of death breathe
When I felt the four fifths something told me squeeze
I felt like it was the end of a dynasty
Like I was fighting a clique of five Chinese thieves
Karate slippers with slip on's so I kept slippin'
The floor was too smooth felt like I couldn't catch a grip in
Felt like Dragonfly Jones, was Dragonfly Tone
So I kept spitting, woke up when I heard the phone


I never gave a what on how the next rapper felt
I take that rapper's belt myself, I feel how Cappa felt
I don't really need help, use a sharpie, don't need the felt
Marker, walk on water, I see how Jesus felt
No rhyme or reason, just bleeding, my every breathing's felt
This about a thesis that even paraplegics felt
These boys ain't needing, they barely breathing, believe it, seen it
Till you got cheated, you couldn't tell me how cheating felt
I'm not a failure, I couldn't tell ya how losing felt
Might not have nailed her, but I can tell ya how spooning felt
Remember when you first heard the rap and the way it felt
I burned the track with a murder rap and I know it's felt






George Peppard


I whip cause I sprung shit, bang, heres a bung hit
Cats split your tongue, shit, bitch got cum sick
She can keep the knee pads, sign for the helmet
Man vibrations, coming off the pelvis
Thugs and prescription drugs, yo, wheres Elvis?
Pull off the panties, she was smelling like a shellfish
Gung when we rung shit, that run, here we come, spit
Eyes on the gunship, heh, heres your Blistex
Heres a spliff twist, hanging out the window like a rhyme smith
Now you taking flicks of my footprint
Sunshine and dough ride just like a biscuit
Live wire, no installation is required
One match, I set the world on fire
Live wires, no installation is required
One match, I set the world is fire


The God said to put the fire on it
The God said to put the fire on it
One match, we set the world on fire
One match, we set the world on fire


Its the art of war combat, every move is high tech
Human Terminator nigga, plug me into SkyNet
Red bone, hot head, burnt down my projects
I turn sound into killing flying objects
Blood off contracts, kill em on contact
Yeah, I got bread, dead? Nope, not yet
Damn, you aint pop yet, haters wanna block that
Snatch mics, hunchback, talk smack, I punch back
Flew off the launchpad, right through your insides
Great minds combine, try to study my enzymes
Skating on the thin line, fighting for the airtime
Push back your hairline, with shots of tequila lime
Stay on my global grind, talk with a sober mind
Putting in more overtime, till I reach a billion
In the condominium, skinny tall Brazilian
With so many tats, she looking reptilian




My hand hot, killer, curry in the pot, killer
Look how these killers thinking they are and they not, killers
I get the drop, killer, all the killings stop, killer
My heavy hitters flex on everyone you got with ya
This tracks not filler, talk with my hands, Im tryna feel ya
It might be the fact that we not familiar
Or, not La Familia, a monkey with bars
You not gorilla, Zilla, calling you Don, my pen has gotten iller
Yeah, you know who we are, you know the slums
Where the women keep the wook in they bra, thats where Im from
Cops catch you with the rook in the car, this where you run
You can die here, son, and the ambulance never come, ugh
Aint no limit till I spit it, my Yankee fitted
Shout out to critics that know Im wicked for killing minute
Shout out to rappers that aint committed, but think they get it
Hold up, now wait a minute, let me put some hating in it






C'mon
C'mon, state your business
C'mon, let's make it hot
C'mon (word) let's make it hot
C'mon, let's make it hot
C'mon, let's make it hot
(Hardcore, to make them brothers act fools)
C'mon! C'mon!


With all due respect to the game, I'm the P-H-enom
Not ready for prime time, be-yond, extinction
Change your way of thinkin, or be-gone

Biohazardous, pretentious

State your business, pay me at the door

Shell shocked soldier in the trenches

Shell shocked like I'm six months in the bush

Bounce like boxsprings on your Kraftmatic
Before you be suin Doc for malpractice
You couldn't bang from start

Yaknawimean? It's gettin' ready to happen
We bout to black out, Funkmaster Flex
Full Force, what you know about it, baby?
Bout to give you what you need, what you want, understand it
Strictly blast off material is what we dealin' wit here, you heard?
Let's go...


Put your hands in the air, cuz I'm about to blast
Bambue bout to set if off on your ass
Bring it on, what, the way I do this
Ain't nothin' to this, raps run through this
Steppin' up the game now, run wit Full Force
Don't have to rock no jewels, and I still floss
Coachin' French style, I spit, blaze it out
Tricks skip it out, what you talk, we live it out
Love up in the club and I post the French toast
Shades of French braids, back is exposed
The don diva got you twistin' they clothes
Fuck wit Cola bottle type body like 'whoa'
We let ballers get me cock-eyed, cuz I print out when we lock eye
Not shy, the skirt cut high, the style fly
C-notes in the brassiere, by the tata's, you broke
Float nigga, bye-bye


It's gettin' kinda hot in the club tonight
Dance, drink all night, mess around, spend about a dub tonight
Cuz I like, the girls that live in the club (It's on fire tonight)
Dance, gettin' tight, mess around take some home tonight
Cuz I like, the girls that live in the club, they just
{Float on, float on, float on, float on} (keep it bouncin', get it movin)
{Float on, float on, baby, float on}


Yeah, I like the chick to be, lick it up
It's easy up for me, pick 'em up
Take 'em floor, sweat 'em up
And welcome to the bar, wet 'em up
Let's get set, yo, grab the honeys and let's go, do a 59 in the 'Esco
Cuz on cell phones, two-ways, ballers are down, yo
It's just a sign of the times, yo


N-O-L-I-M-I-T, try to step in this mutha, like, yea, that's me
You know, all up in the club on dubs, wit the tank on
Party club, half on love, get your drink on
See somethin' you like, g, get up outta here
It's bout to get hot, so look, sit up by the fan
When I come through, make her forget about a plan
She got a dude? Make her forget about her man
Look, you want it, but you ain't really gotta front
Besides run the streets, and then you tried me once
And ma, you ain't know got a triple x about cash
I'm P little brother, you look smart, so do the math
Full Force in here, gotta holla at Flex
Some say I'm spring bout it, cuz I'm private deck
But they don't stop up in here, you ain't bout it, you got up in here
It's bout to get hot, yo, you got up in here?




All the mami's in the spot, pick 'em up
Make the booty hot, sweat 'em up
Funk passion on the rocks, lick it up
Dancin' til I drop, wet 'em up
Don't wanna dance, then I'mma have to ask one of your friends, so
Then I take 'em home in my Benz-o
Free screens, DVD's, twenty inch Lorenzo's
It don't make no sense, yo


Yo, every hour on the hour, "chill" like Rob G
Then he snap wit the power, the hungry M.C
I be by this couch, niggas ain't blowers you flower
Eat bullets and shit gun powder
Found you, reachin' for that chrome in your trousers
Supply the, get up on that left, turn an hour
Hurt me, firstly I put you on the ducks where the dirt be
Personally I just don't give a what
Have mercy, RZA beat's bump like herpies
And Meth run this track like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Club hoppin', in the apple, where it's rotten
I'm bird watchin', trynna get in mami's stockings
Funkmaster Flex, it's about to get ugly, and God don't like ugly
Honeys permed out, lookin' young, dark and lovely, pass me the bubbly
I come wit Full Force, you can find us where the club be




If you don't give a, like we don't give a
Throw your hands up, if you live in the club


Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Let me know it's real, son, if it's really real
Somethin' I can feel, son, loaded up and killed one
Wanted raw deal, son, if it's really real
Aiyo, we come in Full Force
Got my girl Bambue, and Funkmaster Flex
One love to Lou Star, he's a live muthafucka




Aight, and that's the way it goes down
Funkmaster Flex and Full Force
This is it, let it happen, one




See me in the club, got a gun on my leg
Select paper and invade all the illest niggas tally up paid, yo
Live Crew meeting, laying in the lab with robes of fly Mo
We hold all niggas eating
Racquetball gangsters, unleash the law straight up
Colorful drawers, bad whores on the weekend
Eat it raw style like Flounder
Fucking with mine or how we design my niggas might find ya
Laying in the Tropics, big dick shit on park
The way his Clarks look, niggas on topics
Moving out, coloured Durangos, picture me broke
That's like picture rich niggas with the same coats
Or rich niggas with the same coke


You can catch us cruising, balling a ship, fully equipped
On a StarTAC, calling a bitch, I'm what you get
When that Absolut and Hennessy mix (Ultimate! Ultimate!)
Wu shit, my whole click (Ultimate! Ultimate!)
Rub-a-dub, ass in the club, showing me love
Saying Peace to the nigga that thug, I got the drugs
And the .38, snub-nose, striking a pose
Baby girl spilled her drink on my clothes, the new Girbauds
Louis Rich, Hot Nikks, nigga what's happening?
Ain't shit, holding my dick, smoking a clip, thanks for asking
Mashing, the latest fashion
Dance floor packed in, whites, blacks and latins
All in together, together for worse or better
Now I put it down whether it's Methy, Method, or Meth-Tical
Rock, skate, roll, bounce
I'm bound to wreck your body as they turn the party out


All magazines lay fly life we live
The lingo was to let y'all niggas know how niggas rep
I'm set lighting the Purple in a new Lex
Trifling work, let's murder everything that move on the set


I better pay Big Mama for using his lyrics


And my mouth stay dry cos I swallow the struggle
I might connect you to a VCR after they plug you
I'm not a gangster and I hate thugs too
I'm just a nigga that paint a picture without a paintbrush too
Without a paintbrush too


Bulletproof Wallets, 20 G kitchens sets made out of Korea
Top Sear, gots to be a lots to see a rocks
Knots we re'd up behind the stove asking how Maria popped Lea
Cursed out Nia, burst out her purse
With the gods you jeer from Star's Pizzeria
Peace hate to be ya, especially when them shots ring off
In slow motion when yo' head hit the meter
You lost two liters, at the same case speeder
Peter slid through shook 'em down for his reefer
James chased Theresa with a hatchet on Easter
Two murders in the hood, we call it double features
Watch how I eat this, freak the best teacher
After prayer with the preacher, I get skied in the bleachers
And your girl, I might eat her
I'm a lover, not a biter
I still catch her for a pizza


You can be as good as the rest of 'em or as bad as the worst
So don't hate me, you better move over yeah!


You fucking idiots!
Wallets motherfucker!
All my shit is bulletproof
Bulletproof projects, bulletproof wallets
R.A.G.U., you heard, you bird-ass niggas
Y'all niggas ain't got a chance




I'm your highness, your highest title, numero uno
Putos, they clone  like Naruto
Your man super, grand groover on that Sambuca
Mass mover, automatic rap Ruger
Clap back, I bleed for my brother
You know, the wolves stay fed cause they feed on each other
I got a G for a mother
Cynthia's son, take the game like three at the buzzer
Harder than the prison wall, hitting y'all all
Up in critical condition it's official when my clique involved
Listen y'all, Sir I certified
Anything other than the facts are falsified
They idolize I, well i know wise guys, leave em eyes wide
Inside the gravel pit, spitting cyanide
Darts flash, hot enough to warp glass
When the shark pass, piranhas park 


I'm kinda swole, cause everything I want I got made
I never feared, got everything from choppers to blades
They gave me rags and all of them they knew I want haze
When I was spliffing that night, me and the  with K's
Some kids across town thought I was amazed
Knew I was fronting, I had the army in range
It's most of us popping pains, selling drugs in the rain
Trynna make money, maintain and build me a train
Deal with facts only, no slang, that's only for dames
We will run up in the building tags and niggas with chains
Rocking range, lock and aim, take your sneakers and chain
Leave em snubbed, outta luck, you shoulda bought you your flames
But you didn't, this could happen to a king or a queen
Be on point next time and don't be bringing no lames
Cause if you fuck up the next time it might make you famous
Might bump into a gunman who only want brains and shit


I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
I get the cash, see money over tricks and
But keep a snow bunny in the kitchen
The hood still love cause I'm different, see that's the difference
I talk greasy, my hands greasy, that's the chicken
It's that easy, my flow phat cause I'm that greedy
You got to feed me in stacks, what up to Crakk Peedi
State property, racially profiled
State trooper stopping me, I'm low down
Dirty it's a shame, I should slow down
Kick off my shoes, put my coat down
Separate the oil from the coke now
Pennies I got plenty and I still want more
Kinda like a Beamer '35 I still want four
85% still don't know
That is a hundred percent and y'all rappers tryna steal my flow


I got a name from everything from con to Sway
I got my row stitched up by a Colombian name
I got a crack spot, a G5 I never flown
I got a shark, a dog with a solid gold bone
I even copped me a piece of mind up in the Buddhist mountains
I don't sweat money, I got ten accountants
With fly bitches butt naked in Bermuda
And buddha, ice cooler, Grey Goose and big Ruger
The fact is, I pose for low in Gazelle glasses
The booth Ted Dibiase just tripled the carats
And you can tell by the style I choose
I'm creatively superior, I rhyme over the blues
Never lose, never lost,  of the frost
I got a whole clan and Tonetana's the boss
I get paid when my record is played
To put it short: I got it made




Get it!
Haha, Funk Doc in the building, bitch
Ya'll already know the business, nigga, haha


Yo, let's get it, yeah, I'm with it
Streets on fire, I'm frying my dinner
Quick like Sugar Ray Leonard, one love
Any boy get served like tennis
Menace, you call a rap bulldog
Me and my pen form into Voltron
Cold, my heart built with a snowball
And I fuck old women like Zohan
Roll on like Mitchum
Barry Bonds this bitch when the beat start pitching
I'm broke, my ATM ain't kicking
But what I drive, I build expensive
Look at me, nigga, I got it
In pocket, ask Houston how I 'rock-it'
If I go hungry, you getting robbed
By me, Biggie Smalls and The Delfonics


Yo, man, yeah, yeah, take it back to Rae shit
Straight off the muthafucking concrete, nigga
You know how I go, word up, let's go
{Three minutes left...}


Before all the cussing and the gunfights
Don't wanna run Nikes, yeah, scramble when it sunlight
G's in my pocket of juice, blue goose
I'm a goon under the moon, glow on the boosters
Yeah, deadily my sons regret me
Windpipe writing, the mic fighting, respect me
I'm from where it get down, machete your mother
Snatch your brother, scrap you down
You know the deal, when we do this, chill
Catch me in Brazil, ratchet on, little glass of Tequil'
I sware to the real, my real, if I don't win
Then I won't spend, I'm grabbing bill
That's the hammer, I'mma do this, nana
Niggas who hunt, snatch 'em up, bite the clip, the banana
And this is for them good niggas, blow that L
And that blow that well, and watch the book, niggas


Yeah, watch them jooks, niggas, you know what it be, man
Word up, niggas staying alive (Gotta kill these voices in my head)
{Two minutes left} Bunch of fucking roaches, man


Jeter, married to the game without a pre-nub
And she don't act up, if I don't eat her
Damn, now that's what I call a diva
You sick, man? I'm what you call a fever
And I don't put no snow up in my cheeba
Pack a little heater, the game get colder in the freezer
Hit your little corner with the sweeper
Dance with the reaper, sharper than a fuck
Plus I'm laying in the cut like a half-moon Caeser
What you getting is the truth
My bird eye visions spot the pigeon in the coup
Same way I live it, how I spit it in the booth
Next to RZA, ain't no nigga bigger than the group
Stat, fuck that, we come strapped
Bust gats, drug raps, and pump cracks
What you trying do nigga, we done done that
I'm off the gunrack, nigga put ya gun back


Yeah, you slow your blow, boy
You gon' lay where you lie, nigga
(Get rid of the crack, and flush that dust
Hurry, where the L, move, come on, freeze, freeze)
{One minute left}


Aiyo, I woke up in handcuffs, heard the police wanted me dead
Big bullets and splashing all over
Kingpin's still moving that weight
And his main goon burned up a discotech
He's a hazard, classic, nigga, we got a flick of him
He jacked Nate, while he took the picture
And we tapped his crib, bugs all in the jacuzzi
Under the seeds bed, we found an uzi
Trully, and we know about his bitch in Charlotte
Pulled her over, State Troopers found two revolvers
And she told us them handguns "That's my fathers
And I'm licensed to carry those shits regardless
Ya'll just played my man, caught her with a million dollars
Worth of fireworks, coming back from Japan
It's nothing, ya'll police be fronting
And stop looking at my pussy, like ya'll want to suck it, I'm out
On ya'll pussies, catch me next time, bye bye"


Alright, fellas stand back and watch the closing doors
Lock 'em up! Let's go, lights out



Get it!

Lock 'em up! Let's go, lights out




From the Hill to the Shaolin
All the rules that came, from foreign part
From the Hills, of the Shaolin
With an iron fist of fury and the mighty sword
To fulfill the prophecy of the Wu-Tang, of the Wu-Tang


In the Polo store, fronting in war clothes, it been like this
From right in time when I was nine years old
I was a hot mess, smoking cheeba, running with stolen speakers
Dropped beepers, even wore a victory vest
I run with niggas, digging knots from niggas, running out the school
Stunting, back of the bus, flashing the ox
Rock the V-Gooses, everything we wore was name brand
Sold three lucy's, just to get on call plan
R.E.C. Poss' Rockers, the Blip Brothers
Even the Spin Doctors, sat and smoke blunts, I been bopping
All my kins blew up, we grew up with
We used to do what? Running through the sewers and then shopping
Pick pocket, deuce baby, take it in truce, baby
You know how we do, come run in my boots, baby
The niggas came through, touch the God, here Shallah
Ever since went from ninjas to gem stars, sing Rah




Reunited, another LP, we're all excited
That wreckless eyeballing'll get your girl indicted
My touch like Midas, I cramp your style, arthritis
These niggas is food, I eat they food, nigga-ritis
Your man don't snooze, insomniac
This The W, the Clan don't lose, you putting hands on who?
Hands down, I can handle you, you half man, half animals
If you are what you eat, and eat pussy, you'se a cannibal
And stopping me, is what you can not do
Either get in the game, get out the way, or get ran right through
I ain't different Method Man like you
But you ain't like us, we play rough, my community tough
And little kids in my community cuss
Ya'll be showing your guns, but the ones in my community bust
And when they do, you get a jewel re-up






Yo, yo, yo, yo

Meet mark and pardon me to heat mark
A dutch spark it, Lex Leonardo arts profit
Apple cranberry mixed with Cristal, fan worry
Desert mountain crib in the ground, we arsonists
One point five a liter, take a taste, splash your heater
Smack your face twice, clap your sneakers
Shit is like a mission to Mars, fishing for bars
Taking what's ours, knowledge the car pa
Don't be stupid, get a little cash better swoop it
Throw it in the ground and recoup it
Next check was best, your family pack your shit
Get vexed, leave a nigga standing in a bag of leaves
Some niggas catch on later
Try to put them on they haters
I met eighty of them niggas yo
Waiting on the sidelines drooling
Some need schooling
Let me teach yo and roll a student what
Rule one: yo respect if you lose son
Don't be big back about to learn to move dunn
All hell to niggas in jails
With sharks in they fishtanks
Now he come home he a whale
Wolves in the projo's, projo's yo
We realer up in my shows yo
Middle finger five-ohs
Take time to climb vines yo
Lay on the lines like Laury only loving Rae kind
Sun splash cash layign like three bags of hash
Fully wrapped in a Indian man's stash

You wanna be thugs
You wanna be pranksters
You wanna sell drugs
You wanna be gangsters

See what I mean black queen stop actin' like crack fiends and

Rock the same game plan, ours (Yo, Yo)


Ladies and gentlemen, you're about to see
A pastime hobby about to be

Backhand slapping the phoney

Proposing that you bleed on the Chef apron

Fuck you and now your man feel
Time don't stand still for y'all bitches
Wanna Big Ball, I got two for you to juggle in your jizzals

On tracks we connect, politic ditto, take that to that

 (x2)
A-yo; what you wanna be when you grow up
You wanna be thugs
You wanna be pranksters
You wanna sell drugs

That's what silly boys are made of




Get the fuck out of here, I'm LL Cool
Soakin wet with bad bitches in the indoor pool

Yo what am I, an animal?


Cuz I bagged your's too
One bad mooley, nigga you can't school me
I'm the G.O.A.T., what I wrote cause fire and smoke
To think I started on the choir singin solo for the pope
Tell your mama please, get up off her knees
You can't wear yellow spandex wit a ass like cottage cheese
Open toed shoes, feet smell like collard greens
Toes *Kriss Krossed* like she on J. Dupri's team
Bunyon you're sittin up like beach balls in the sand plus
A mouth full of rotten teeth with a dildo in her hand
Who the fuck let you in, all my assistants are fired
Now I'm lookin for some washed up rapper that I can hire
You know some old school nigga wit a bit of attitude
Pay him $1500 to fuck a girl in an interlude
You say I'm souped up, well, soup is good food
So what I scratch my nuts, how the fuck is that rude
For soul glowin, afro pickin
S-curl hatin, Jamaican rum sippin

Kid I'll burp on your girl buttcheeks


Cuz honey had my nuts like two red beets
I'm bananas, out of my fuckin mind they won't let me back in
Cuz I was down before the hype like Dusty Rhodes and Bob Backlund
Bruno Samartino, Stan Staziak
Now The Rock and Stone Cold are my favorite maniacs
The top rooster pluckin, chickens when Im cluckin
WWF stands for When and Where we Fuckin

Fuhgidabowdit
Yo kid
Fuhgidabowdit
Fuhgidabowdit
Yo, Fuhgidabowdit
Yo, ey, Fuhgidabowdit
Ey, ey, Fuhgidabowdit
Eh, Fuhgidabowdit


Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I'm like Menace II Society
I roll through the drive thru like Kane
Jack you for the cheeseburgers and chicken wings, and Daytons too
See my boys down the ride crack patience too
Bricks, walk around, snorkel down
Maccaroni and cheese Timbs broke out the orphan house
Transportin out, the poison in 'em
Box 'em up in the aisle with the frozen dinners

And them niggas that ran...


My goal's to get 'em
With the heat seekin flow wit, fo' antennas
Doc's Da Name, that's why y'all fuck wit me
I'm pocket change, the bums don't fuck with D
Objective in 'em, Carlo inspection sticka
Check the pen, I write like a X was in 'em
Teeth grittin, I brawl wit a major league mitten

Where the stash at, punk

Yo, yo, and he takin me wit him

Fuhgidabowdit
Yo, Fuhgidabowdit

Yo, yo, yo, Fuhgidabowdit

Yo nigga, Fuhgidabowdit


Yo, this be a Cool J function, music get my blood pumpin
Down for whatever, which usually means I'm up to somethin
Who owe me somethin, them niggas in the back frontin
They rockin cuffs and, put the eight up, rappercussion
You know my name, so there's no need for introduction
I'm Mr. Done it all, so none of y'all can do me nothing
Bitch I'm grown, puffin on that one and bone
Bet me and Queen Bee be swingin til the honey come
Backs get blown, trash get thrown
In headlocks, from this view, I'm fuckin Star Jones
I'm red hot just like candy, in '95 won the Grammy

Yo, he use it as an ashtray now

Niggas can't stand or understand me, yeah
Either or, funky headhunter wild comanchees wit shitty draws
What's that shit, what shit, that shit on your lip
I can't smoke wit ya kid, but I'll save ya the clip...

Fuhgidabowdit
Ayo nigga, Fuhgidabowdit
Yo, what the fuck, Fuhgidabowdit

Uh, Fuhgidabowdit 
Ayo dog, Fuhgidabowdit 
Bitches can't stand me, Fuhgidabowdit 
Still pullin down her panties, Fuhgidabowdit


The shit I see every day brings tears to my eyes
How I holla at my niggas brings ears to my cries
Stick niggas for not knowin, then teach 'em somethin
Bitch niggas talkin bout you from the streets you frontin
I never liked you, and you, I don't know
So what the fuck you think is 'sposed to happen, we gon go
Mano a mano, whatever nigga, I'm gon dust you
If you can't take that ass whoopin, I'm gon' bust you
Talkin to you like a lil nigga cuz you is
But don't forget that daddy's gonna always love his kids
Faggot niggas got the nerve to wan' know why I rob
You guys are livin phat while everybody else'll starve!
That pretty shit is lame, fuck what your name hold
Break a nigga off somethin, watch a nigga gain fo'
Now you layin somewhere cold, stiff as shit
And all that riffin shit, mens will get you hit, bitch

Fuhgidabowdit

Verse 1: Sticky Fingaz

Who made black folks slam and throw they guns?
Who made da world bacdafucup in '91?
Who made niggas go out and shave they head bald?
Who beat Dr Dre for a soul train award?
Who da first rap star u seen dive into da crowd?
Who originated that screamin grimey sound?
Who had da last verse u were always waitin for?
Well he's solo now u ain't gotta wait no more?
STICKY FINGAZ! my life is like an action flick
My solo album coming out february da 6th
I got a question whats it all about in here?
I got a question who got da hottest album this year?
I brought everybodys album who came out this year
And I want my money back I got the hottest album this year
Do u know how much universal paid russel simmons to buy me
Even interscope was havin biddin wars tryin to sign me
Do u think its all about da monney nah, nah, its more than that
Its real shit when thug niggas want ya autograph
There's only 3 hot rappers thats out no lie
Lets see theres me, myself & I
I might flip out & bug once da la gets in me
And go stab a nigga like Ja Rule did fifty
When I rhyme, I put rappers on da spot
Recording in da same studio, 2Pac got shot
Bringing to da game new ideas
I cop more respect than u, I ain't dropped an album in 2 years



Black Trash
Yo kick that old real shit
That green shit

Verse 2: Xzibit

Came to change, smoke, provoke da whole shit to bouncin
Announcing ya name to loud might get u shut down
I vitallity cut down after da club close
Wettin up ya sunday clothes, with a snub nose
That's how it goes, Xzibit give a fuck what u thinkin
Everyday for me is a week in a blast of da mohcians
You bastards is tweekin, I came to get some pussy & skate
I never debate, fake featherweights catch a nikel plate
Me & my niggas seen da moves u feelin mate
And all da bitches seen da dick that they should've ate
We multilate then vacate in da golden state
Home of da place where niggas usually make there last mistake
So pop ya collars & enjoy ya drinks
Cos u ain't tryin to see death & I ain't tryin to see da clink
With the flick of a wrist, send you deep into the abyss
I don't pop Cryst', but will pop a nigga with this



Word Up!
Yeah we takin all ya money
Takin all ya bitches

Verse 3: Method Man & Redman

Yo Yo Im so hot to def
I'll probably get shot to death
Y'all niggas wanna rock wit Meth?
Not on ya best day
Stoppin ya breath da M.E.F Way
Lets say we get this off our chest
Let da tec spray
S.I. back up in da joint I must confese I
Burnt down da muthafuckin house before I left I
These ladies on da dance floor showin butt
My niggas in da bathroom throwin up

Carrying a black shottie walkin up da club
Pick out ya dirtiest crew I can stomp in da mud (Who Want It?)
Cos when I scream when im pumpin a slug
Start airin out da room like im vaccuming up
Doc u know da rukcus gonna get brung tonight

Killa Bees says somebody gonna get stung tonight
Hit me, hit em up, stick me, stick em up
If we can't live it up, somebody gotta give it up


Black Trash




If you got it, light it up (8X)


Ain't no shook in 'em, Pyrex pots is hot, fiends is cooking 'em
Little niggas hugging the block, cops is booking 'em
Women hugging they purse when they spot the crook in 'em
Back when little J got shot, pops was whooping 'em
Little noses dripping with snot, ock, now look at 'em
The ghetto got a hook in 'em now, drugs, stay pushing 'em
Used to throwing dirt in these blunts, now, it's kush in 'em
Used to tell these chicks to shut up, now, he's shooshing 'em
Get cash, get that ass or put a foot in 'em
Iron Flag, flag that cab, Bedford and Put-e-nam
There ain't no puss in 'em, dick, dildo, or gush in 'em
Niggas still got that juks in 'em

 + (Raekwon)
If he front then we stomp 'em out (Get 'em out ya way pa)
If he drunk and he run his mouth (Get 'em out ya way pa)
If he front then we stomp 'em out (Get 'em out ya way pa)
(Get 'em out ya way pa, move, move, move)


I'm seduced by the chrome, it's a ruthless poem
It took a little time to get his juices going
Producers know him as the kid with the Iron Palm
Righteous hammer examine the firearm
Approach or get fired on, permanent chest scar
Empire Strikes Back, check out the Death Star
Bless y'all, wet y'all, do the impossible
Where I'm from we use dum-dums in the arsenal
Highly sparkable, get stretched off the knuckle check
Known to scuffle, I take it to the upper deck
Universal conquest, kung fu buckle vets
In a dufflebag, max yo, a couple techs
Give 'em ear hustle, Wu brand we programmed
Next time we dance, it won't be a slow jam
I fear no man, son you get lynched up
Nigga bitch get Frankenstein stitched up




Yeah, voice skipping off percussion
Give it to 'em how they love it, slow flow, deadly, beloved
All praise the daunting calm yet
So alarming, without a word being spoken
A thought with no voice, just a nod and a look
The contract was took, straight cash, off the books
A major pawn took a Don, look, he's armed
With a few black rooks from the heart of the Crook
Shook ones look while they hung him on Hercules hooks
They found his body near a shallow brook, escaped on foot
Switched the look up, out of state, he got the hook up
The flipped cake, thought lighter than the feather
Yet heavier than weight when my mindstate starts to break
Take cover over RZA instrumental
I'm damn near invincible, it's simple




Tell me, what are they like?
They got holes in the top, five round holes
While I was watching, this stranger, hit them
But his fingers went right through the bone
So then, they've... mastered it
It's some style of kung fu, you know it?
The Skeleton Claw




Yeah, hah, we vibing, Channel Live-in
All day, hah, come on! Yo!


It's me, the M-E-T-H, I O-D and you want dope shit
Sniff a hold ki, my code read be my conscience
Telling me it don't make sense
Then God is nonsense a nigga's best defense is his offense
So yo I watch po-po, and ducking dodo
Thirty cent a go-go, trying to steal my Mojo
Oh no, you're fucking with a pro who go for dolo
For sure though, I seasoned veteran, holier dobo
Come on now Judge Judy, you're telling lies to our vision
While our black youth get imprisoned
When my eyes see through your eyes, you're hypnotized
Subconsciously you change the station to Channel Live
That underground hardcore sound, who said it died?
Cause win in this, me and nine's the first to fry
For a nigga, live by the fire, die by the flame
Happy I'm gone, knowing my son gon' be the same
It's the diggy-dog DAT, who put his feelings
On the pad with the pen, Unleash the Dragon again
Uh, I'm on ya, like hot grease on a skillet
Gorillas on Real TV just living with us


I'm living like a hundred
In a Jeep, stolen, wolves in sheep's clothing
All beef frozen, bust like cheap Trojan's
Naturally strolling, blunts and weed smoking
We keep choking, bitches on their knees open
I spit like a automatic, semi-bark and park
And if you hear me starting, blame the Remy Martin
So lick a shot, ghetto people, dutches and c-lo
Ducking the repo and fucking a lady seal
Rhymes by divine ego, smoked out in a Cadillac Regal
With a mommy on my beach-o
There's eight million stories, only six million ways to die
There's two million niggas getting away with crime
Plus two million more wack niggas trying to rhyme
Now that's four million niggas trying to eat at one time
It keeps the thugs gunning and blood running
And the judge fronting, enough to make a nigga touch something


Niggas fucking with that strick-nine, they might not get mine
So they owe me big time, it's Ghetto Business
Niggas jack cars and rap stars watch at the gas bar
Bitches dancing naked on their lap, it's Ghetto Business
(Niggas hold ones, hot ones, stay in the biscuit
Ghetto nigga so of course it's Ghetto Business)
Blunts and weed son, ghetto seeds son
I got what you need son, it's all Ghetto Business


This is for the senile walking on the Green Mile
My lyrics be like the spirit of a teen gone wild
Shit it's after ten bitch, where's yo' child?
The nine in this pocket, locking it down like P now
I did the knowledge to the born, your style is straight corn
I woke up in the morning, heard yo' shit and just yawned
You fucking up my high, no lie, you could die
So just ain't for my mind yo 'fore I break you up like Guy
It's the, Earth clinger, new style bringer
Rappers fronting in the war, playing fat like Corporal Klinger
We still bring the hardcore with R&B singers
While the beast ask you out like hoes on Jerry Springer


Yo, Rowdy, hot balls, flow so sick
And I won't stop 'til I'm so so rich
While y'all niggas spit I, blow hits
Don't waste time, son I don't waste rhymes
You minute shit, track done like squids
If you ain't hot, come like this
Real niggas hold the gun like this
Pop something, one in your leg
Make your ass run like this, now picture that
Defeat Ral? Never that, son son you brave
You ain't a man cause you got a little something to shake
I've been a thug since the sixth grade, rocking the fade
Young to me, look what the ghetto done to me
Made me bolder now, heart colder now
Brick soldier now, gun holder now
Niggas snatch my chain? Catch and hold 'em down
Hit him 'em with the hot slugs, life over now
I know you wanna test Ral, what you waiting for?
I live one-thirty-eight, basement door
City and north, you can't escape the Ral
Find me where Channel Live be at
What is this? Ghetto Business

*beat switch*


You ain't gonna blow up shit, you're merely a bomb threat
How the fuck you gonna move a crowd?
You ain't moved out from your mom's yet
I'm a vet., better yet a vet-er-an
The word Smif-N-Wessun like Megatron
Understand, I'm past hip-hop
I should be put into tiny zip-locks
Distributed by those who flip rocks
Leak use after wordsmith be
So dope you better sniff me
And learn to keep me out your mouth
Get me, I'm going to Armaghetto, swiftly
My whole, clique be, sickly
So we don't sleep, we spit in bed
Those that's trying to get hit in the head
Fuck around and get hit in the head
Everything I write is either a death sentence
Or a bloodline for those who, love nines
We don't stand in club lines, we VIP
Thugs love to hear me spit that
If you ain't down with Ghetto Business
There's exit, punk, hit that




Uhm hum, y'all thought it was a game
We ain't playin' wit' y'all motherfuckers, uh uh
East Side/West Side Connection for real
Uhm, this is how its goin' down huh
Come down to you and me huh Mr. Size
It's real


M-E-F, ain't you heard yet kid I'm cobra step
Vocal threat, mark of death, y'all ain't seen nothing yet
Movin' on your fuckin' left, over time, sudden death
Competition, hold your breath, when you see me hold the tec
Party people lie, enchant with evil eye
Tical and Roni Size, bring your beef with ecoli
Poison and kill the noise an', your fam' and all your boys in
Seek and destroy young brothers
Tougher than they baby mothers
Your class short on cash, running low on gas
Empty don't even tempt me, to pull his nine and blast
The sky is fallin' fast, the world is panickin', panickin'
People haulin' ass, now who the man again
Yeah I got love to share, go bring that pussy here
Where? I don't even care. Vaseline intensive care
Throw your hands into the air (c'mon), we 'bout to take it there
Full cycle, no fair, now who the man again
Now who the man again
Now who the man again
Now who the man again

*repeat verse*


Red light, green light, one two three
Ain't no hope in stoppin' me, we ain't got no pot to pea
Mr. Mef, Roni Size, shady eye with lazy eye
Crazy hive, maybe I crash and burn like Lady Di
Blackin' out, passin' out
This is what I they askin' 'bout
Ghetto life, tuck your whites, fuck your wife, bust a pipe
We gonna fuck it up tonight, girl make sure you suck it right
Hold that mic like Dolomite, get them blunts and roll them tight
What are you men or mice? Kid I just begin to bite
Back like Erin Brochovich, you know that means apocalypse
Oh shit, bottle this, why don't you just follow this?
Any race, color or creed, just like the Apollo with
A phenomenon, from Bristol to P. Long
Be on the law, huntin' rappers out of season
Throw 'em in the air, we 'bout to take it there
Full cycle, no fair, now who the man again (make a threat, pay your debt, Meth-Tical)
Now who the man again (throw it back, you knowin' that, goin' back)
Now who the man again (so you say, all day, you know I'm down)
Now who the man again (aiyo yo, represent, represent, represent..)
Now who the man again (represent, represent, represent, represent..)


Everyone, please, attending
Please kindly line up in one line
And everybody gon' get they ass in
Just take your time, not now
An' I don't give a fuck who you know
Your ass not gettin' in without a guest pass
Alright, you first, gimme your money
Oh, hehehehe...
One two, one two
We transmittin' love
The new flex
This is Bristol to Shaolin
And beyond
This is a full cycle affair
Ayo Roni Size, yous a dope motherfucker
That's my word, you're everythin' I love kid

*repeat verse two*


Roni Size and Mr. Mef
Cat is staggerin', oh shit


Celebrity status is in the eye of the beholder
As one who is capable of
Turning nothing into something
One who's all ambition is so intense
That he can settle for nothing less than the best
Here lies the Ghetto Celebrity
Oh shit




Digital Electronics!


So we gon' check the 25th caller
Caller? (Hello?)
Caller, you're on the air (Yeah, hello?)
You're on the air, sweetheart
(Hello, yeah, I'd like to make a request

Well, I got this new joint, the Glocko Pop

(Oh, I love that song!
Oh my God!)
Here it is, just for you, sugar


Bobby Digital back on the set

Drip drip drip drip, drop drop drop drop
Hip-hop you just can't stop stop stop stop
Watch my Glock Glock Glock Glock Glock

His rugged go pop pop pop pop
You stomp the fuck off yo' block

My Glocko pop pop pop (x4)
You stomp the fuck off yo' block
My Glocko pop pop pop

Bob Digi-tech live in effect, you just didn't expect
One man to come along and bring a new song
And break your barrier down, you can't carry the sound
Buckwild juvenile from Shaolin Island, what? What?
Who wants to get violent? Remain silent

My Glocko pop pop pop
My Glocko pop pop pop
His Glocko pop pop pop
His Glocko pop pop pop
My son go pop pop pop
My gun go pop pop pop
His Glocko pop pop pop
One love, go pop pop pop

Yo.. who wanna play the hero? Your chances are slim
Less than zero, Shaolin laboratory friend
That's the shit though, came to satisfy but can't get no
Sound pasified from the get-go, Cuban neckties for you Kiko
Only carry mines for protection, the hoods like the Wild West I reckon
Hold up a second, lost my breathe and
Take it from the top Introducin'! (Mr. Method)
Runnin in your session
With nothin but my words as my weapon
And twenty-eight years of aggression
Do it for my people when I take it back
Like I'm repo-man, agent double-oh negro
Know who I am? No, I don't give a damn
Evil, flash a Crooked I like I'm Deebo
Gets down and dirty like your moms pots and pans
From a small town, drink ya down like Shazaam!
This is how ya Enter the Wu-Tang Clan (Yeah)
36 Chambers, you're pu-tang man (Word)
Brothers with a mic make a true slang fan(Yeah)
Brother with a gun make the loot change hands (Word)
That's how it is, you could ask RZ-A
Through rain, hail or snow I deliver


DJ, that music just turns me on


The marvelous bone crushin assassin appears to be
Blind in glasses
Daredevil bang head with shovel
Iron skin, Tony Starks, liquid metal
The rebel in the evenin, shadows sweapens, vanishin
The book of instruction, fuckin with the Wu-Tang Production
Is lord to all who come and see, my art too deadly to teach
Read my death touch, ascended grief between each point
Slendid, hand Swingin Sword recommended
Slice through the bone intended
Try to sketch the classes, reflection of perfection
Mic-phone swing like numb stick to scar
Mohammed Ali, mic MC, Shakwan walk the dead sea
Dead sea, Digi..


Yo, yo.. yo..
My mind keeps playin tricks, I'm caught up in The Matrix
Digital mode, your flows is all wasted
You smoke weed with seeds, I crush mines and lace it
Two tokes a pass, kid it's all basic
I know you lust, so relax and be patient
As soon as I spark the stem, ya all taste it
Number one on the charts, it's time to erase it
Replace it, you was wack from the start, face it


DJ, that music just turns me on


My Glocko pop pop pop
His love go pop pop pop
My Glocko pop pop pop (x5)
You stomp the fuck off yo' block
My Glocko pop pop pop
His Glocko pop pop..


DJ, that music just turns me on




Yeah, know what I'm saying?
Wise Intelligent, broadcasting live from the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro
Know what I'm saying?
Hip hop go wherever I go
For real, Poor Righteous Teachers represent
'96 off the hook we're dropping this hit kid
Watch


Lord, how you be, madam G, peace God
Fuck frauds, get yours, kick ass, leave scars
On Mars I built a school to study life on Earth
Thoughts burst, a million rappers murdered in the first verse
Now what's worse than eating dirt, being buried alive
Put to death by surprise in the name of black gods
Ain't I most fly? Young pie don't cry
Dry the tears from your eye and your lover might live
Life to give, life to take, never making mistakes
All wise enjoying everything right and exact
Poor facts, pro-black, Donnelly Homes projects
Learn that time is the same on Casio or Rolex
Knowledge James, chapter two, verse one through six
But try not to judge a man by the price of his kicks
Come off this talk shit  convert words to actions
Cause you know Jersey runs things every time boy
Build destroy, Trenton must make noise
Enjoy the fruits of life, need the wife and my boys
My seed won't need for anything, trust me
Black man, 'nuff land, eight hundred acres of trees
Please the seven seas travel regularly
Degrees consciously study everywhere we be
Family daring he who talks enough shit
And come and get the stitch to fix the split upper lip
The shit providers
Will call us great civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers black


Whatever happened to the Gods and the Earths
They thirst for a pot of gold God's worth is birth
Knowledge is worth more than diamonds
When the mind is shining, surprise us
Gods Earths and 85ers


Dedicated to the Gods and the Earths
Dip dip dive-a, civilize an 85er


Intelligent, twenty-three, now nineteen five
Hold the mic I'll rise right in front of your eyes
In here six years see what I felt every year
Oh yeah it's ninety-six I'm born and understanding, understood
Get the goods, build a school down south
In some remote location that nobody knows about
Teach, add on to the life that we live
God degree, twelve jewels, eat the foot that I give
No pig, strictly kosher mathematics and fact
Poor blacks on track mission to take the Earth back
Cause Whitey got it locked, that's why the whole world's lost
We wearing crowns made of thorns and being put to the cross
Lost souls futures told in the Dead Sea Scrolls
God reduced to a savage lacking soul control
Talking lots of shit about his drugs and guns
Several daughters, 'nuff sons, ain't trying to raise none, yo
Whoa-ho-ho, let me slow up with the flow
Can't move too quick because niggas got to know
The duty of the civilized is to civilize the uncivilized
And make the world recognize
That God is Wise, and Wise is God to the death
And back to life, you Lazarus and I'm the Christ
The forthcoming, like a thief in the night
The wave of light, the key to everlasting life
That shit provide us, to call us straight civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers y'all


Whatever happened to the Gods and the Earths
They thirst for a pot of gold God worth his birth
Knowledge is worth more than diamonds
When the mind is shining, surprise us
Gods Earths and 85ers

 (x2)
Dedicated to the Gods and the Earths
Dip dip dive-a, civilize an 85er


Since I've been away I've been thinking about
How gunslingers turned singers and black culture went out
Wake up all you teachers tired of teaching and wait
Grass roots, pass truth into the ears of black youths
Watch me talk the talk and walk the walk right now
As mystic as it seems, I bring for real to your dream seeing
Midnight marauder got it dipped off the block drug
Street niggas bug cause they know we do it for the love
We rose above every limit that they said we had
Who loves your ass enough to strictly educate the mass?
Come get your cash, fill your mind with swine and dash
For longevity, these niggas we will never be
You will remember we from now till forever G
I am infinity, lyrics flowing endlessly
You ain't no friend to me so don't even pretend to be
Like O.J. Simpson be sleeping with the enemy
I call you out and make the world know your ass is lacking
Quoting some lessons but see no parts of understanding
You standing under my rain, snow, sleet, hail and thunder
That's why you wonder what's causing this to exist
I raise the mist, distill the myths of many currents
Don't be determined except to life forget the death
Nevertheless you're being blessed cause I'm who God is
Don't know the time niggas must be wearing Guess watches
Hands on your boxes, turn 'em up like seven notches
Your Magnavoxes amplify my super conscious
Shit providers, we'll call us straight civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers y'all


Hold it down kid and you don't stop
P.R.T. represent shop
(There's a new set of rules you shall all have to abide by
And the non-lyrical shall be terminated)




Aiyo shorty, yo that's my word
Oh, y'all smelling y'all piss now y'all think y'all gold
Yo anybody get caught flinging over here
I'm returning 'em, that's my word they getting blasted
Anything from 220 to 140, that's mine
Y'all need to step the fuck off
Y'all niggas ain't crazy for real


Yo, the fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you


I'm deep down in the back streets, in the heart of Medina
About to set off something more deep than a misdemeanor
Under the subway, waiting for the train to make noise
So I can blast a nigga and his boys,for what?
He pushed up on the block and made the dope sales drop
Like the crash in the Dow Jones stock
I had a connect to cross-sales, to catch more mill's
Than ho-bitches got birth control pills
I'm in the park setting up a deal over blunt fire
Bum nigga sleeping on the bench, they had him wired
Peeped my convo, the address of my condo
And how I changed a nigga name to John Doe
And while we set up camp, we got vamped
Put the stake through his heart, I ripped his fucking fangs apart
Snake got smoked on the set like Brandon Lee
Blown out the frame like Pan Am Flight 103
He got swung on, his lungs was torn
A kingpin just castled with his rook and lost a pawn
A regular on the block that played lookout
For preying predator with a Glock, he should have took out


No neighbourhood is rough enough
There is no clip that's full enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you
Fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you


It's mandatory that I supply all my troops with mega firearms
Big apes and spread 'em out like crops on a farm
To get cream, sometimes they repaint the scene
Like the last episode on gates, and other niggas
Plant bombs till the smoke from the blast becomes thick
And flows through, all they knew, he's gun sick
His Glock clicks like high-heeled shoes on parquet floors
Mad sick, stand on hills and invade wars
Filthy foul, shovelling dirt, he's out to hurt
For instance, chop off hands, attack worth
His idols would lock down airports and extort
Some import, catching ten percent of what the fiends snort
Up in the ski resorts, up in hills
They move keys and had the skis making drops on snowmobiles
The plan was to expand, catch seven figures, release triggers
And live large and bigger than my nigga
Who promised his moms a mansion with mad room
She died and he still put a hundred grand in her tomb
Open wounds, he hid behind closed doors
And still organizes crime and drug wars


Fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you
No neighborhood is rough enough
There is no clips that's full enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you
There's no cuffs that's tight enough
There is no niggas that's fuck with us
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you




Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo
You got me going
Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo
It's all because of
You, you, you, you, you
You got me going
Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo


Let's take a moment and own it
And not be scared to show it
And love like we've never before
I know you know it, don't hold it
Back and start to glow it
And I don't wanna see it no more


In and in and in and out we go
Out of love and I don't know
How to keep my cool around you
In and in and in and out we go
Why'd you make it difficult?
Boy, I'm getting fed up with you


As soon as I say goodbye
I'm feeling alone
Ain't no way I can live without you
So by midnight
I'm back on the phone
Ain't no way I can live without you
See the love high
Killing all the lows
Tell me why we don't keep a steady flow
So my goodbyes
Really mean hello
Really mean hello
Really, really mean hello




I never chose you, I chose to
Get on the roller coaster of love
But that's what life had in store
As much as I want to jump off
My heart is saying hell no
Some how you got it beating for more




I know that we argue, fuss, and fight
Who said love was easy, don't know life
That's true
I'm crazy 'bout you
I know that we made love till daylight
Who said love was easy might be right
That's true
I'm crazy 'bout you


Sun in the sky, feeling no rain
At the same time we don't want it to change
It's you and I, pleasure and pain
At the same time we don't want it to change




Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo
You got me going
(Really mean hello)
Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo
(Really, really mean hello)
It's all because of
You, you, you, you, you
(Really mean hello)
You got me going
(Really, really mean hello)
Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo

89 in the bricks is 15 and growin'

I'm so high that I can piss on a cloud
And make a bird look up
Smokin' haze in the Hummer while the bird look up
Gettin' high wit the hammer so the bird shook up
I get high like Doc and Meth
And "Let the Monkeys Out"
So I can "Bring the Pain" while I pop ya chest
It's D-Block when the bastards repin' (D-Block)
All I need is a lighter and some haze with a master collection

Hit up a weed spot
Then off to the D-Block to smoke it with Styles

You find an MC like me, who's strong
Leavin' motherfuckers aborted, with no verbal support
When I command the microphone
I get deadly as Khan, though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm all those
Who can withstand the more power I gain?
And make it possible, for me
To drop a few to wreck yo' brain
Imagine and keep on wishin' upon a star
Finally realizin' who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin', faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all-time?
When I created rhyme
For the simple fact, when I attack I crush your pride
Our intention to ride, every time, all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced what I'ma ride
Breakin' in gas with the '68 all day
In-and-out with my pay, I'm soon to count the bodies


So mandatory my elevation, my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with the nigga you facin'
We must be patient, nothin' better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable, like gas stations
Sorry, I left that ass waitin', no more procrastination
Give up to fate and get that ass shakin'
I'm bustin' and makin' motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted
Put that ass in the dirt, you swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to "Rhythm Nation", but thugged out
Forgive me, Janet
Who's in control? I'm activatin' your souls
You know the way the games get controlled
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin' rhyme I wrote
Takin' off my coat, clearin' my throat


I got my mind made up, come on
Get in, get into
Let it ride, tonight's the night
I got my mind made up, come on
Get in, get into
Let it ride, tonight's the night


Well, I comes through with two packs
Of the bomb prophylactics
For protection, so my fuckin' sack won't collapse
'Cause nowadays, shit's evadin' the X-rays
Sendin' young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder if my terrifyin' tactics of torturin' MCs
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifyin' like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin' poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's the fuckin' Bombay
You got ten steps before instant death, like Bai Mei
My rhymes'll leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly virus spread through your head, like Sand Palm
There's no escape, nah, I ain't blastin'
I use my mental to assassinate assassins for those askin'
Opposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killin'
Why is that? 'Cause smilin' faces deceive
You best believe: to MCs, I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camp's under siege, and I'm Jason Voorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mics
My verbal snipe your vocabs on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall
You already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the Equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To L.A., on the spot where I rock and bust, like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat


Fuck you losers!
While you fake jacks, I makes manoeuvres
Like Hitler stickin' up {Jews} with German {Lugers}
The mister Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this message, don't touch the dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musketblaow!
Melons get swellings
I paint mental pictures, like Magellan
Half of my clan's repeat felons
Niggas best protect they joints for nine-nickel
Man, I stay on point, like icicles
Now, who wanna test Tical, then touch Tical?
All up in your motherfuckin' mouth
Headbanger boogie, catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man rolled too tight, you can't pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and fallin' fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot, like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast


Ayo, lyrical gat spittin' the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this mad underground basement shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm spliffted
Funk Doctor, who?
Spock, bitch, don't get it twisted
I got connects, like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless the dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust 'til every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out 'til your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift
Now, you claim that your gears locked
Whiff this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous, like John the Bomb Analyst
Flip MCs like kis
My degrees freeze consecutively, like EPMD LPs
Lick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake wanna snake
Bust it, I'm the one pushin' the hearse, in the first place
Confidence for you shaky-ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke off this antidote, got you ope
Get roast by my lyrical Billy Dee .45 Colt
(And I'm out for nine-nickel)

Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke, off this anecdote got you ope
Get roast, by my lyrics Billy Dee .45 Colt
And I'm out for nine nickel


I set the mic in flames, my name's INS the Rebel
Murder one style, smash piles straight to pebbles
Mental terrorist, specialist at this
Menacing lyricst, leave crews defenseless
Can't design landmines, lick off like nines
To paralyze everything, ears ring like doorknobs
Heads start to turn like police who pass
Hear the blast, my crew bust through like tear gas
Fuck a mask, we laced in place like the marshall
Sparkle, like live but harder than tarvue
Wreck this rhyme, start relentless, roughest
And fuck up the party for you paying motherfuckers
Once I commence for you ladies and gents
I kick rhymes, sharper than barbwire fence
The live and direct, from Killah Hill Project
Staten Island, New York, you can't help but to hawk
Lay it on your dental, that's if you want it hostile
Sounds so underground I write my rhymes on fossil
Dudes like this, force me to get you open
Lyrically wet you open, until you soaking




Show & A.G. got the flavas (the flavas)
Rolling with the dwellas and the neighbors (the neighbors)
(Repeat x2)


Hey yo no question I'm the best in this rap business
No doubt I'm strapped, get back or get clapped ridiculous son
I'm flippin this one (don't be dumb)
You better run or end up like my last victim
Shit that's real I already been through
Scared from the threats I sent you (it's all in the mental)
Jackin niggas like I'm in the Central
Cuttin through that ass like a Ginsu as I commense to
Get big with my nigs, A.G. & Showbiz
Now your idol was doin vital damage to your ribs
Word straight up and down, crab MCs get crushed
I'll leave your style cramped, my crew can't be touched
So when you hear the bomb you know it's D. Flow son
No one can fuck around, yeah that's right (no one)


Hey yo the honies on the dilz cause I play ball good (it's all good)
I'm still representin the hood
Big shouts to Uncle Pete, you're my number one neighbor
No doubt I'm puffin later with my nigga Gary Aida
Peace to Roc Raida and all the goodfellas
People gettin jealous, well it's the brothers (the brothers)
On some other shit can't forget Shabazz
Representin not to mention that I'm gettin cash
Get with that or get with this because I'm kickin this
With the styles I'm runnin through niggas like Emmitt Smith


Touchdown, I buck down MCs that step up
10 G's if you wanna MC wrecked up
The Ghetto Dwella's in your hood, hoodie down
Stomps from the Bronx, the boogie man from the Boogie Down
Momma never told me there would be days like this
That I'd be rippin tracks, gettin paid with my nigs
On tour, roar with that hardcore stuff
Niggas call bluffs (I give em no chance) I make it more rough
(And even slow dance) on niggas faces, rugged, fuck it
Them niggas got to love it cause we made this
I'm gettin papers with my peeps
As Party Arty keeps Bacardi so MCs meet the shotty


Check the method but don't sweat the technique
Even made the baddest dime bitches get weak when the vets speak
(Hopin) That your head meets my bed sheets
(Now you're open) Like the Red Sea cause I'm potent
Don't fit? Don't force it, Flow got that 4-fifth
Who do with that voodoo, my doll it's that cordless
All this and that and then some
Get paid to put raps on tracks, I guess that's my income
The beat chills so they be comin back for refills
(My man shows his street skills) From here to the Peekskills
Kill the rumors, givin MCs brain tumors
Time to step off the set, gotta jet like Puma




What the blood clot, son lick a shot, show your love in the area
Forget me not, mass hysteria
My style revolves around blunts, the Methical
The one and only piece original, never phony
One love to my muthafucker A.G
A true giant in the industry, hold your shoes up




Sing it bitch... oh boy...
Niggas... ha-ha... ladies... yeah
Oh boy, come on... yeah...
This is just a few of them things that I ("got to have") yeah

Meth, yeah, want respect, then he want his check cleared
This is just a few of them things that I ("got to have") fuck yeah


Now if it's something I, want, no need for me to front
Why stunt? Better notify them niggas from the dump
Oh, yeah, I got to have it (have it)
And, oh, yo, I got to have it (have it)
If it's something I, need, don't have to beg or pleed
My weed, got 'em high, just look at they eyes bleed
Oh, yeah, I got to have it (have it)
And, oh, yo, I got to have it (have it)


Yeah, I got to have that mansion and the yacht
The room to park the phantom on the yacht
E, watch me leave them haters on the dock, yeah

Staring down they nostrils in them Ferragamo goggles
This is just a few of them things that I ("got to have") fuckin' a'
I got to have a new spot to live, a few props to give
One for each verse I did, with 2Pac and B.I.G., y'all
This is just a few of them things that I ("got to have") damn right

In the dash board, and then I need no limits on that black card

When we mobbing on these New York streets, nigga
This is just a few of them things that I ("got to have") fuck yea






I ain't goin back to jail
Next time, the County or the State see me
It's gonna be in a bag

UHH! This is it baby!
End of the road, ha hah!
When you a dawg, you a dawg for life!
You don't hear me though, you don't hear me though
You don't hear me though, c'mon, c'mon!


Watch them young guns that take none, nobody safe
From the Friday the 13th, ghetto Jason
Itchy trigger finger achin, snatch yo' ass
Out that S-Class for fakin, forty-fo' blast
Is a bloodbath, take your first step down a thug path
Ain't no love here, just slugs here
Kids know the half you get plugged here, that's just impossible
For the weak to last now behold the unstoppable
Third eye watchin you, watchin me
Throwin rocks from the penalty box, cop a plea
Young G we was born to die, don't cry for me
Just keep the heat closely and ride for me
Cause we family for better or worse, you and I
From the dirt, you snatch purse, so hard it hurt
To be here, and each year, I'm pourin out more beer
For deceased peers, holdin fort
Police line 'Do Not Cross', they found his corpse
In the loft with the head cut off, and butt naked
Homicide the crime Method, add another
Killer verse to the murder record, the Grand Finale


Who wan' test me, c'mon!
Me shot pussy-hole fi fun


Hot corners, cops with warrants, every block is boring
Friday night, getting bent, lick a poem
My dawg, not even home a month yet, and blaze a girl
In the stomach, he robbin niggas who pumpin
Lil' Blood got popped, by the Group Home cat
Everybody nervous in the hood, pullin they gats
Fiend yellin out, who got those? Go and see
Shorty snot-nosed, he don't floss but he got dough
Thug faces, fugitives runnin from court cases
Slugs shootin past for the love of drug paper
Queens cap peelers, soldiers, drug dealers
And God'll throw a beam of lightning down cause he feel us
May the next one, strike me down if I'm not the realest
The Mayor wanna call the SWAT team to come and kill us
But, dawgs are friends, if one see the morgue, one'll live
To get revenge, and we ride to the end
Bravehearts blow the lye with Henn, and still rise
Took alive with live men, my man got three six-to-eighteen's
And only five in, the Belly of the beast
Didn't wanna hear the shit I tried to tell him on the streets
It's irrelevant, the beast love to eat black meat
And got us niggas from the hood, hangin off his teeth
We slangin to eat, bringin the heat
Bulletholes, razor scars is the pain in the street, huh


When you a dawg you a dawg for life (ride or die)
My dawgs feel pain from love (see eye to eye)
Give us one shot at life (let us fly)
Come on niggas! (we dawgs for life)


There's mad money out here dawg
Mad money out here
What you tryin to get it? (Word up)
You gonna bust your gun to get it? (Tsh, whatever yo)
I hear you I hear you


Uhh, I've lost my grip on reality or so it would seem
Pinch myself to wake up, cause I KNOW it's a dream
Niggas that don't know me see me and think I'ma rob em
Niggas that know me well see me and think I'ma problem
I'm just a nigga that's misunderstood
But word to God I turn your last name to Underwood
Cause if I see it, I'ma take it and run with it, that's me
What type of bullshit is this nigga on? That's D
The dawg come and getcha outside
The more blood flows, when I plug holes with the snub nosed
Gun blows, bullets whistle, wouldn't miss you
Hit you all up in your mouth like it tried to kiss you
Drama, it's right here, how MUCH YOU NEED?
Beat you down with gat see how MUCH YOU BLEED
How MUCH YOU PLEAD, for your life, you was a killer
And all the bitches comin up out that ass you feelin, gettin realer
Now beg for your life, one more time, one more crime
One more nine, c'mon cry nigga
It's over! This is the shit, that hits hard
You either the last one standing, or the last one to fall






I ain't goin back to jail
Next time, the County or the State see me
It's gonna be in a bag
UHH! This is it baby!
End of the road, ha hah!
When you a dawg, you a dawg for life!
You don't hear me though, you don't hear me though
You don't hear me though, c'mon, c'mon!

Chorus




If ain't rough, it ain't me
Tales of the darkside, grand finale


Ready to die, cuz only I know where it's in
And if lie to dough, then it's kill in my soul
For my love and dough, don't make it no better
Mami, don't flirt wit the iron and hit 'em whoever
A nigga that flips the weather, any Rule, J-A
Fuck wit me, it's Murda, I-N-C
Feel her, nigga, feel a hole to meet
(if it ain't rough, it ain't me)
Holla at me, my real niggas, get down, ready to kill niggas
We don't touch no more, we kill niggas
Give me what it takes to throw my guns together
Fast up, hit 'em up, towards the hot beretta
You should know better, when obviously they don't
So the shit, sure to get you one in your throat
By the time, you realize that shot's the truth
It's too late, they reminiscin' over you, my Lord


Watch them young guns that take none, nobody safe from
The Friday, the 13th, ghetto Jason
Itchy trigger finger achin', snatch your ass out that S-Class for fakin'
Forty four blast, it's a bloobath, take your first step down a thug path
Ain't no love here, just slugs here, kids know the half, you get plugged here
That's just impossile, for the weak to last, now behold the unstoppable
Third eye watchin' you, watchin' me
Throwin' rocks from the penalty box, cop a plea
Young g, we was born to die, don't cry for me
Just keep the heat closely, and ride for me
Cuz we family, for better or worse, you and I
From the dirt, you snatch purse, so hard it hurt
To be here, and each year, I'm pourin' out some beer
For deceased peers, holdin' fort
Police line, do not cross, they found his corpse
In the loft, wit the head cut off, and butt naked
Homicide, the crime method, add another
Killer verse to the murder record, the grand finale


Hot corners, cops wit warrants, every block is boring
Friday night, gettin' bent, lick a poem
My dog, not even home a month yet, and blaze a girl
In the stomach, he robbin niggas who pumpin
Lil' Blood got popped, by the Group Home cat
Everybody nervous in the hood, pullin they gats
Fiend yellin out, who got those?  Go and see
Shorty snot-nosed, he don't floss but he got dough
Thug faces, fugitives runnin from court cases
Slugs shootin past for the love of drug paper
Queens cap peelers, soldiers, drug dealers
And God'll throw a beam of lightning down cause he feel us
May the next one, strike me down if I'm not the realest
The Mayor wanna call the SWAT team to come and kill us
But, dogs are friends, if one see the morgue, one'll live
To get revenge, and we ride to the end
Bravehearts blow the lye with Henn, and still rise
Took alive with live men, my man got three six-to-eighteen's
And only five in, the Belly of the beast Didn't wanna hear the shit
I tried to tell him on the streets
It's irrelevant, the beast love to eat black meat
And got us niggas from the hood, hangin off his teeth
We slangin to eat, bringin the heat
Bulletholes, razor scars is the pain in the street, huh


If it ain't rough, it ain't' me
Down for dice, is what you told me
If it ain't rough, it ain't me
See, chick from the other side, grand finale


My dogs for life, call for life, now who be the job like fuck Totti
Slim weight, petite, body, down for my niggas, quick to pull a shotty
Sprayin' everybody, lacin' the whole party
Holdin' wall when my niggas hung, wit I rush
Like boys that I do know, it's me I trust
Now watch how I tie bust, guarantee I be sittin' down
Waitin' to hear up, wit the blast
Got you niggas snitchin' weed in my stash, high flow
Over the bitch who knows to stash weed
Cold for you bitches who try to oppose me
Hot Totti, same chick in Belly
Ooh, if it ain't it ain't me


Uhh, I've lost my grip on reality or so it would seem
Pinch myself to wake up, cause I KNOW it's a dream
Niggas that don't know me see me and think I'ma rob em
Niggas that know me well see me and think I'ma problem
I'm just a nigga that's misunderstood
But word to God I turn your last name to Underwood
Cause if I see it, I'ma take it and run with it, that's me
What type of bullshit is this nigga on?  That's D
The dog come and getcha outside
The more blood flows, when I plug holes with the snub nosed
Gun blows, bullets whistle, wouldn't miss you
Hit you all up in your mouth like it tried to kiss you
Drama, it's right here, how MUCH YOU NEED?
Beat you down with gat see how MUCH YOU BLEED
How MUCH YOU PLEAD, for your life, you was a killer
And all the bitches comin up out that ass you feelin, gettin realer
Now beg for your life, one more time, one more crime
One more nine, c'mon cry nigga
It's over!  This is the shit, that hits hard
You either the last one standing, or the last one to fall




1,2, 1,2, yo check this out, it's the jump off right now
I want everybody, to put your work down, put your guns down
And report to the pit, the gravel pit
Leave your problems at home, leave your children at home
We gon' take it back underground, I be Bobby Boulders
Wu-Tang Clan on yo' mind one time
It's the jump off, so just jump off my nigga


Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it


Ha, holocaust from the land of the lost
Behold the pale horse, off course (off course)
Follow me, Wu-Tang gotta be
The best thing since Starks and Clark Wallabees
African killer bees blackwatch
On your radio, blowin out yo' watts
From Park Hill, the house on haunted hill
Every time you walk by your back get a chill
Let's peel, who want to talk rap skills
I spit like a semi-automatic to the grill
Elbow grease, and elbow room
Baby play me, baby fall down, go boom
Party people gather round, count down to apocalypse
(I'm the kid with the golden arms)
And I'm the motherfuckin hott nikks pass the blunt
My nigga don't front
You had it for a minute but it seem like a month
Now I'm chokin, smokin, hopin
I don't croakin, from overdosin
Hey, kid, walk straight, master your high
Wu and Meth got you open (open), let's ride
Can't stand niggas that floss too much
Can't stand Bentleys they cost too much
Kid wanna get up then kid get touched
Kid wanna stick up then kid get stuck
I'm the one that called your bluff
When your boy tried to act tough
Remember what Ol' Dirty said: "I'll fuck yo' ass up!"
Now listen


Back, back and forth and forth


E with the English, extinguish styles extremist
Bald head beamers run wild
It's the kid with the gold cup
Stepped out like what
What's poppin, and y'all niggas dobo
Blastin shae shae, chocolate shortae
Rich color mocks, rock those all day
1960 shit I'm Goldie
That's right motherfucker don't hold me
The world's greatest, Las Vegas, paid as rock
Skin painted on my face look ageless
Perfect combos, Ghost bang out condos
Jeff from Hamo, ex three bangos
Bancos, stank hoes in plain clothes
Change those, bang those, same old, same old


Yeah y'all, straight up this the jump off right here
The gravel pit, word up represent, rock the boulders
All my rich gangsta style, killers, y'all know what time it is
Shorty do your thing, get up on that shit right now boo, do you
That's what I'm talkin 'bout


Yo, step to my groove, move like this
When we shoot the gift of course it's ruthless
Grab the mic with no excuses
In a sec, grab the Tecs and loot this
Executing, shaking all sets, and I'm breaking all hecks
I'm taking all bets, move all best, who want the dram' next
You all stank, we got the bigger bank
Bigger shank to fill your tank
Still the same kill you for real, while you crank
Slide, do or die, fry to bake
Admire the greats, on fire wit a heart of hate
Bitter shark, every part I take, heavy darts that quake
It's okay, all fakes, get caught by the dropkicks
You know the thrill, yes it's Park Hill
Yo we hit 'em with the hot grits
On the go, check the flow, saying Wu don't rock shit
Stop quick, hold the gossip, stop sweating my pockets
I hear the hot shit


Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it
You don't have to move a mountain
Just give me enough strength to climb
Oh Lord ! Don't take away my stumbling vows
And lead me a round


Yakub, maker and creator of the devil. Swine merchant... your time is near at hand. Fuck with me and your time will be now. Your presence here effects the mind of my people like a fever. You, Yakub, are the bearer of nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine diseases, evil, corrupt, porkchop-eatin' brain!




1,2, 1,2, yo check this out, it's the jump off right now
I want everybody, to put your work down, put your guns down

Wu-Tang Clan on yo' mind one time
It's the jump off, so just jump off my nigga...

Party people gather round, count down to apocalypse (3, 2, 1...)

Stop quick, hold the gossip, stop sweatin my pockets
I hear the hot shit






I Silver Surf the city circuits, forever lurkin
On the street surface, I spit blood for blood verses
Grands man divided, we still stand, conquer land
One man'll body slam Def Jam
Focus your headcam zoom in, with radio tune in
I know you're listenin, so I keep showin and provin
Play the sideline, waitin for the right time to take mine
Street crime, nickel and dime rhyme
Fuck a peace talk, let the gun spark, on the streets of New York
I Shaolin Strut through the city asphault (FED UP!)
Hold your head up, I'm circlin the block, keep your eyes up
Wise up, before you get sized up (TIED UP!)
Play no games, speakin on my name, you catch a clipful
From close range, diggin in your pocket, take the loose change


Punch the data in your mainframe, you want it all
I want the same thang, strive to maintain, live out my name
Hard to obtain, hard to explain, ain't nuttin changed
Leave the same way I came, bringin motherfuckin pain


Killa Hill Projects, high-tech street intellect
Let's connect, blow your headset, fuck a mic check


Ring around the underground, pocket full of sound
Ashes to ashes, y'all niggas goin down

Yo.. eat shit and die slow, battle ground no survival
You goin down, y'all niggas fuck around
Shittin where you sleepin, so my rhyme proposal
Came indecent, beef from the butcher sink your teeth in


Fuck what you believe in, you real fake, fishin in the same lake
Eatin off the same cake you blowface


Who got that ready-cooked, synthetic look, actin crook
Betty-shook worm, tryin to shake the hook, as the world turn
Nigga burn, once again the supersperm
Rub it in your skin, like it's Lubriderm, time took to write this
The war will be fought by the righteous
Who stand criticized, by his un-A*Alike-ness
Knowledge is the jewel, and it's priceless
Real like them Rahway Lifers, nuttin but time on my hands
Observe the black sands in the hourglass, fallin fast
In this savage land, haulin ass, Days of Thunder
It's road rad, your days are numbered
What RZA put together let no man tear asunder (motherfucker)


This is P.L.O., Killa Hill flow, but you don't hear me though
Live in stereo, pump it loud until your speaker blow
Ghett-io slang pro, sling rap to cashflow
Keep it live from the intro until the outro

Killa Hill Projects, high-tech street intellect
Let's connect, blow your headset, fuck a mic check


Ring around the underground, pocket full of sound
Ashes to ashes, y'all niggas goin down


My dick! (My dick!)
I'm on a suicide run, y'all niggas know the outcome
Razor sharp tongue leave scars in your eardrum
Forty-five bar seminar ghetto rap star
Slide like water rats through the Staten Resevoir
Swingin swords cut your mic cords, snatch your rap awards
Commercial cats, fuckin up the game, that's why I crash boards
Drape floors while you Jordan, keep on tryin yours
Hardcore, somethin that my street niggas is dyin for


Snap your neck and the dopefiend, Gobol 13
Professionals we know things, say no more
Check my Dogs at the Reservoir, gourmet special of the day
Is nigga souflee, pusher gotta pay
And the games people play, John Jay back around the way
Fish filet, Mr. DJ, turn it up a notch
Hit the replay, for dirt bomb niggas in the PJ
To cling-on, bring-on, the good times, to key-on
Hook rhymes that's be-yond, your thinkin, for eons
I been here, to shine on the black mind
Tell you like the last time, year of the grimy nigga
Ragtime, bad sign, flatline..




Another day, another dollar
I got mines, ain't got nothing to father
Fuck a role model, never had one to follow
Lot of cotton mouth rappers, I'm a hard one to swallow
Here's another hard one to goggle
Fuck your life, that's the motto
I'm nice with mics, Cus D'Amato
Drug related, blunt guts all up in your condo
Hate a noisy woman, why you all up in my convo


Let me hold something
Look at you killas, like you owe something
Stole something, give me my paper, 'fore I blow something
Right now, give me my fucking shit, chicka-blaow
I want it right now, give me my fucking shit, chicka-blaow
Shady niggas hiding the loot, you see my baby needs shoes
And the record label trynna recoupe
I want it right now, give me my fucking shit, chicka-blaow
And I mean right now, give me my fucking shit, chicka-blaow


Gun battles, so many chains on the neck
Hands and feet, niggas say I'm Shaq
Sky blue, terry cloth, low pullover
Hit ten like a 2010 new Hova
Movies on, never ran it, call me a don
Been shitting everywhere, cuz niggas can't stand it
Terminate faggots who violate us a square
Goon therapy, S.I., we don't fight fair
Beef? We can get it on, right here
And that includes y'all low niggas wearing tight gear


Sun God, and that's your target, aim right there
My money long and green like Buzz Lightyear
I'm all right here, the way I move the blow
Fuck a show, you would think it was an all white affair
Been fuego, more fire here, then you seen me
Getting money off the water like a pall bearer there
No Newports, Marlboro's here, go smoke that
The smoke in your face, bitch, I ain't never cared
Get shot down when the Ghost smell fear, let me hold something
Look in your face like you owe something




I'm playing for the 'bucks' like Hakim Warrick
Nickel bag in the park, my team on it
They want it like that and the street, is dry as a well
Hell, that's why I sell crack on the beat
I ain't trynna just happen to eat, I'mma make a nigga dance
Even if I got to clap in the street
This is something like lock up, murder behind bars
A warrior, my story defined by my scars
Seven thirty verbal, my word work circle
You a jerk, fool, I burn you like your birdds do






Get it burn it, get it burn it
Get it burn it, get it burn it
Get it burn it, get it burn it
Get it burn it, get it burn it
(The gun'll go, the gun'll go..., the gun'll go...)


Aiyo, one thing for sure, keep you of all
Keep a nice crib, fly away, keep to the point
Keep niggas outta ya face, who snakes
Keep bitches in they place, keep the mac in a special place
Keep moving for papes, keep cool, keep doing what you doing
Keep it fly, keep me in the crates
Cuz I will erase shit, on the real, note, you'se a waste
It's right here for you, I will lace you
Rip you and brace you, put a nice W up on ya face
Word to mother, you could get chased
It's nothing to taste, blood on a thug if he gotta go
All I know is, we be giving grace
This is a place, from where we make tapes
We make 'em everywhere, still in all, we be making base
Y'all be making paste, these little niggas, they be making shapes
Our shit is art, yours is traced


This is the way that we rolling in the streets
You know when we roll we be packing that heat
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go...


This is, Poverty Island, man, these animals don't run
Slums where the ambulance don't come
Who got the best base? Fiends waiting to smoke some
Approach something, ask him where he getting that coke from
My dudes hug blocks like, samurai shogun
Cause no V and no ones, equaling no fun
Who want to treat they nose, huh? Body'll go numb
My woman need funds, plus her hair and her toes done
It is what it is though, you fuck with the kid flow
That make it hard to get dough, the harder the kid go
Harder the piff blow, harder when it snow
The pinky and the wrist glow, this here, what we live for
Get gwop, then get low, but first thought
We gotta get the work off, the gift and the curse, boss
Yeah, see I'm the shit yo, the dirt in the fit, no
Hustling from the get-go, the motto is get more


This is the way that we rolling in the streets
You know when we roll we be packing that heat
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go...


We was quiet flashy brothers, strapped all along
With the dirty .38 long, twelve hour shift gate
Took case, state to state, you think he won't hold his weight?
Put ya money on the plate and watch it get scrapped
We get ape up in that club, off that juice and Henn
And it's a no win situation fucking with them
You mean like Ewing at the front at the rim, finger roll a Dutch
Million dollar stages touched, techs, gauges bust
Trust no one, the lone shogun, rugged Timb boot stomper
Damaging lyrical mass destruction launcher
Nothing can calm the quakeage when I break, kid
Peace to my brothers up north, doing state bids


This is the way that we rolling in the streets
You know when we roll we be packing that heat
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go...


Whoa... this is the way we be rolling in the club
You know when we roll we be packing .32 snubs
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go


Get it burn it...



Haayyoahhh! Ahhh..

Intro/Chorus: Rock

Iz u wit me.. yo throw your hands in the air!
All my thugs and soldiers, fuck it even players
Whether you hate us or you show us love
No matter what you do money, stack your gunz 'n onez
Iz u wit me.. yo throw your hands in the air!
All my thugs and soldiers, fuck it even players
Crooks, willies, pimps, all my sons
No matter what you do baby, stack your gunz 'n onez

Verse One: Method

Yo, light another, and elevate on this one my brother
Respect mine like my baby mother
I shine when it rain, the sky's cryin for all the black youth
That's dyin, I heard he went out clutchin his iron
And in the mist the slugs flyin, one burst
He kissed the dirt, not knowin he was touched at first
Or badly hurt, it's all science, another nigga merked
Kid snatched his purse and his work, left nuttin
But the shells on the turf, the situation's worse
A lot of bitch ass niggas is comin out they skirts
Cause it's real, not everyone can rhyme and get a deal
Not everyone can shine and make a mill
So Johnny carry nine in the steel, one in the head
For all them fuckheads, leave that ass for dead nuff said
Don't be mistaken, or mislead, it's all peace
But when my baby's gotta get fed, I'm all teeth
Bitin DOWN on the bullet now, bloodshed
I cop my herb from a knotty dread, and live this life
On the edge nigga.. one time for your fuckin-ass mind
Cuz-o, can you deal?

Chorus: Rock

Wu-Tang are u wit me, well throw your hands in the air!
All my soldiers, thugs, fuck it even players
Heads on lockdown and those on the run
No matter what you do money, stack your gunz 'n onez

Verse Two: Ruck

Aiyyo peep the stamina, of the main brain splattera
In a matter of seconds I'm disrespectin your character
What's the matter ya niggas ain't ready for the massacre
I'll be slappin y'all niggas in the face with the calibre
You like the voice baby? Ruck is the choice lately
Slap a ho in the grapple hold just like Royce Gracie
My boys pay me no mind, for the shit I say lately
Then deep down in they heart, they think that nigga Ruck is crazy
Maybe, y'all niggas should just chill before I fuck you up
I can snuff a duck nigga in the face with the uppercut
What the fuck? Y'all niggas do it the mic ruin
Your life by screwin, your wife now cruisin
Affect with the motherfuckin grimy style
Meth-Tical, Heltah Skeltah for the Ninety-Now
Remind me how, the way it used to be, yo you used to be
Better than you is on the mic, but now you losing me

Chorus: Rock

So iz u wit me? Well throw your hands in the air!
All my soldiers, thugs, fuck it even players
Whether you rap for a living or sell drugs for funds
No matter what you do, stack your gunz 'n onez

Verse Three: Rock

Son I used to be a good boy, fat cheeks, little cute kid
Potentially rebellious yet a straight A student
I listened to my elders til I found out they was stupid
What they told me had me broke and bummy, time for some new shit
Now, I hold mo' concealed Heat than Acapulco
Ricans in Bushwick call me Rocko, el mano loco
Got a fo'-fo' to make thugs sing like K-Ci and JoJo
Packin ever since Mamma Rock said gunz was a no-no
We don't need those tho, street cats don't need gats
Six-five, from the NBA, meaning Niggas Beat Ass
So try me, like Mutumbo you can't get shit by me
Send you to E.R. son with broke ankles like Allen I.V... hehe
Hold that thought for a minute
And watch your shorty before I run up in it. I ain't Bennet
I'm like Sprite, image got you shaken, thinkin I'm Jamaican
But it's thirst that'll get your jewelry and dough taken
FUCK Batman and Robin, I'm robbin with a bat man
Chase niggas like Chevy for makin wack jams
Hit hard as a dick after a lapdance, ask any Sean Price
In Alkatraz fan, they'll tell you watch the jab hand

Chorus: Rock

So iz u wit me? Well throw your hands in the air!
All my soldiers, thugs, fuck it even players
Gods, Earths, and cons, Crips and Bloods
No matter what you do money, stack your gunz 'n onez
Iz u wit me? Well throw your hands in the air!
All my soldiers, thugs, fuck it even players
M.F.C., Killa Beez and my Outlaw thugs
Armaggedeon soon come, stack your gunz 'n onez

Stack your gunz 'n onez, stack your gunz 'n onez
Heltah Skeltah come soon, be prepared motherfucker
Stack your gunz 'n onez, stack your gunz 'n onez
Cause ain't nobody safe motherfucker
Stack your gunz 'n onez, stack your gunz 'n onez
Apocalypse, armaggedeon, Heltah Skeltah
Stack your gunz 'n onez, stack your gunz 'n onez
Same shit

The war's on for real, run grab ya shield
Yo Meth, take the steel and let these cats know the deal


Style blazin, Iron Lung on this collaboration
Money for the takin I ain't sweatin confrontation
With P.R.ah, we beez the mens of tomorrow
Master, license to kill, bringin the horror
To ya house like Amityville, keepin it more than real
Niggas ain't supposed to feel, Hot Nicks ya know the deal
If you read the resume, gives a fuck what niggas say
Timb boots to pave the way, here I come to save the day
Yes stoppin the fuckin press, transform to Mister Mef
See that logo on my chest, save a damsel in distress
Hot shit, in the song, got to Get Until It's Gone
Kids wanna get it on get smacked up and shit upon
Right til ya prove me wrong, think you can do me hunh?
Can't we all just get along, in this modern Babylon?
Dueling with my nemesis, layin down laws
Don't start if you can't finish it, I'm telling you Pah!
Got the power of a meteor shower, comin down
On all ya cowards, trickin ya funds and sniffin powders
Here we come, straight from the slums, Dynamic Duo son
Ghost Rider Jonathan and Soul Brother Number One

"For you!" "KnowhatI'msayin?" - 


Leapin tall buildings in a single bound, faster than a round
Blastin out a forty pound, y'all niggas fuck around
Take that and handle it, Method Man I get
Strong with Titantic shit, that means abandon ship
Get a life and get a grip, there ain't a problem that I can't fix
Transmittin live from Apocalypse

I pee all over your starting line
 based nine
Designed for knuckleheads who bust guns that 
Body surf on the verse 
Beat your feet, big street, pinned you down with the heat
Have you spazzed out spittin out teeth, made nothin 
Big boys, well destroy blunters on bump steroid
50-man convoy is meant to win big toys
Moving through the wasteland, right hands on the silencer
Forty caliber, city slick as Staten Islander
Synchronized minds combine thoughts that motivate
Cold perpetrate, pass the blunt, let it circulate
Street politicians on a suicide mission
Crime vision, finger itchin from a  position
Dangerous gram,  spit around for my veteran
The cloud comes down
Hardcore


Drink a Heineken, have you go inside the mind again
Never mindin men, dropping gem, can he shine again?
Most definite, let this be my last will and testament
For the pessimist to exercise for the exorcist
Johnny treacherous like three, Im supposed to be perpetuate
Thats what make the poetry
Give everything thats close to me 
Jonathan, king of the seven seas battle with Leviathan then the Methodist
Anything can deficit, hit it up 
Lived it up, somebody gotta give it up, John Blaze
Drove em out the water, doctor Bombay
Your bitch look like  , eyeing me the wrong way
Don Juan and  giving you different ways of wordplay
They bustin bullets over Broadway

Freestyling, coming off the F-in dome on the Skyrock Radio
Meth Tical in stereo
Never take my words for granted
And I come through, understand it aint no limit to what I do
When I rep for my whole damn crew
Double U to the U to the T, A, N, G



Comme le Wu Tang Clan, je dchire sur scne
Lors de scnes, je risque des grosses peines
EN attendant que mon heure vienne
Vision chaotique d'une situation diabolique
La rue a fait de moi Kery James le mlancolique
Si la mort peut devenir une solution
Rester en vie, une sanction
Ds lors, faut que t'affirmes tes positions
Face  leur culture, leur nation, leurs institutions 
Nous subissons une succession de pressions 
Parfois nous nous laissons enfermer selon leurs intuitions
Une mission 
Sans prtention 
L'intention 
De pas subir tous les jours la rpression 





Yeah, play time's over motherfuckers
Spice 1's defiantly in motherfuckin' effect
You know what I'm saying? Bringing it to all you bitch ass niggas
So raise up and recognize, and understand that this brother is hard to kill


I'm running this niggas off their block
Taking their shit kicking it to the bitches
People can't lift off your spot
I'm leaving your shit all up in stitches
Nigga, bullets fly through the door
I'll shoot you and that ho
Got a cap for each nigga fucking with my cash flow
Pid cap, be love cap pid
Because in the neighborhood cause still kill at will
Gotta keep on my pistol on tight
Slanging sugar delite
That china white got these niggas killing each other tonight
Sometimes a turf is like a war zone
Or even Vietnam, not at the movies but you still see the died come
And a nigga catch a slug, caps' be pulled for fun foo
You got to watch your shit before we pull a ak on your own blood
Se niggas will stick you for your cash
That's when they enter the t-shirt contest to super soak their ass
So Method Man show these niggas the deal
Let these motherfuckers know that your hard to kill


Who dat nigga? You with me with the super fly Methtical nigga
Who want to die? For real nigga
Wow, even try to test sides
Challenger your the bird with my .45 caliber
Can it be that this is the S.P.I.C.E. 1 and the Method motherfucka
With the guns blazing? You trail, my god, its amazing
Where your punk at?
Nightmares like Wes Craven
The bigger the critter, the harder to pull the trigga
I'll send your ass back to the dark side nigga
You're a snake, I've seen you sliver, so I deliver with death
We'll throw your punk ass in the river
On the battle ship I'm the captain
Beat that ass bloody as a sanitary napkin


S.P.I.C.E. come to be hard to killah, hard to killah, hard to killah
S.P.I.C.E. come to be hard to killah, hard to killah, hard to killah
S.P.I.C.E. come to be hard to killah, hard to killah, hard to killah


Blah! These motherfuckers nutz if you want to murder me
Harder to kill than your average motherfuckin' G
Rollz with the uzi and that shit that will make your body drop
Close up your shop, tic toc and it don't stop
Nigga, down for my strap niggas on their back
No rat-tat-tat silencer on the mac
Died come again, coming straight out of my jaws
Got these niggas screaming pause
Pistol whip and breaking out their jaw
Yeah, so you don't want to fuck with me
Many niggas out there willing to go nuts with me
And light up your block and leave them smokin like some fucked up bammer
Can't be caught by no Po-Po's, can't be put in no slammer
I don't be fucking with no snitches
Ain't no body going to tell, leave your dick in the dirt
And yo momma as well
New York to Cali niggas are hard to kill

If your not riding with your steal

Capping your ass for the 94, what you know? Grab your Glock
Blah! Me burst out first 'Mon
We Audi 7000 G




The Wu-Tang Clan will rise again
There are many of us, all working for the good of the Wu-Tang
Die


So get your egg crashed by my Hellz Wind Staff
While the pictures broadcast and splash to tell the news
Like Katie Chung, how the bullet collapsed his lung
His father watched in horror as he swallowed his tongue
Another youth dead before the age of 21
Left his son to grow in the ghettos of the slums
Where the shots echo for twisted metal for cash flow
React slow nigga and get P.L.O
By the lone gunner who took revenge for his brother
Who got slain last summer by a cocaine runner
A new year is dawning, new crews is forming
Rival gangs warring, blood steadily pouring
The streets are deep son, every day is like a rerun
So I reach out and try to teach one
But 85% uncivilized content
No tolerance so a lifetime is spent
Behind a cage bent smoked out and on a park bench
Killer instinct, slave rap niggas get lynched


So yo break that nigga arm fast as a fuck
Tell Ra, Goldie left my beige jacket in his truck
To all you slew-footed penguins, ducking from these
Hot rocks that's flaming, chocolate for all you rap Damians
Spraying cards espionage, dodgeball square hard
Strip bars, no bras, wet leotards
In the making, next album 'Blood on Chef Apron'
Keep a Gambino PlayStation in your playpen
Discovery Channel, cats the Book of Daniel
Coke blunts hot as a fuck swatted bamboo
High school dropouts, baseheads get knocked the fuck out
On the regular for robbing a good nigga house
Rough cut raw doses, the unexplainable
Hot rock lava, gringo throw the Frusen Gladj


What you know about this specialist armed dangerous?
Hit you close range with this madness
Unique design shine like a deep dish
The beat kick technique split up your weak shit
Yes, the rhythm, the Rebel
Alone in my level heat it up past the boiling point of metal
Living legend, veteran known to set trend
Lethal weapon, step through your section
With the force like Luke Skywalker
Rhyme author, orchestrate mind torture
Live performer, bid the mic saynara
Borderline to insane, I rain firewater
Tape recorder, can't be saved by a court order
I got my sword across your throat, you choke


We on the run with the golden guns, get you none
When it reach out and teach someone, blaze their buns
Now I'm guilty by association
Times of blackness eclipsing the Sun, target practice
Commence when I throw these darts at these rappers
Ricochet, hit the charts, bloody your mattress
Hold me down, Wu bloodkin, I'm going in
Shooting bullets at the top ten, rhyme concoction
Blend like chameleon
All these niggas want cheese, is we mice or men, word up
We can go platinum but then still can't get no satisfaction
Once again back on the block crumb snatching
Blowing backs in cold blooded 9 assassins, time for action
Johnny Unitas, handle that like arthritis
Still, hold a golden touch like King Midas


Drowning problems in Heinekens imported from Holland
Getting boosted off of Killa Bee pollen
Stone columns get stacked by drum tracks, smack loud like gun claps
Pin a crab to death with a thousand thumbtacks
The Wu centerfold, it be's the Wind Ninja scroll
Soul edged blade controls your Interpol
The Fig Newt', fruit from the forbidden tree root
I stay secluded in the Chamber training new recruits
With Fatal Guillotine, the black hooded team what it means
When bullet screams from the hot Glock like rock from a sling
Pushed through like George Bush Operation Whoops
Shots get popped on the block causing blood to gush
From digital to analogue, the Wu-Wear camouflage
My entourage squad be stomping through Zanzibar
Like herds of cattle, RZA plays the wall like a shadow
Connecting Brooklyn/Shaol like the Verrazanno-Narrows


Stash the cream though, Iceatollah ice style gleamo
Lex graffiti name Ramo, hold em we rolling asking me though
Raps is hotter than hot tamales in Toledo
Pussy that shit she passing off to me though
We wax Ajax niggas with an axe, Maxamill
You could crash a mil got your back still
Scold em and fold em like the thousand dollar bills
Sit back eyeing y'all niggas out
Fakes that delegate we spitting fire out
Verb burglar, design the Wally shoe store reserve a jet status
Guyanese bird up on my mattress
Watch me mack this, Ralph Lauren goose incite a fashion
Yo, these hands is flooded and they mad quick
Strong approach like magnets, custom wood crane name
Styling rich, rsum the waves and one chain
Feeling mics like, wheeling a bike, slide like
Step on his Klondike, get your dart right, we moving on it like
Wind breaker niggas get they face broke, jewelery get snatched
Magazine right on the low, fuck y'all cats



Turn the beat up a little bit
Got to get that part, baby
I'mma do it like this, baby, I don't give a f*ck, baby
Yo, yo
I walk in the spot, and I see niggas standing 'round
So I ask what's going down
Got a girl in the back, a blunt in the mouth
And a chain on my neck, hang to the ground
Hey, I said how you feel?
Baby look tough with a gangsta grill
I ain't rich, but I pay my bill
I'm like Jay, I'm trying to drop me 'a mil'
My hood tripping, chrome wheel whipping
With all these hoes, you can tell I'm slipping
Shots of Patron, got bird eye vision
Even broke niggas wanna learn my pimping
Yeah, yo, let's be clear
You're unaware what's in the underwear
She said 'yeah', I said 'yeah'
Pulled the purp' out and put it in the air
Aiyo, I smell something burning up
So I throw it up, and I put it in the air
(Tell that DJ, turn it up
While I roll it up, and I, put it in the air)
{Higher, we gon' take it, higher, watch me move it
Higher, we put money in the air} Put, put, put, put
Put it in the air
When I come up in the club, and I see my niggas on the wall
And I'm like 'yo, what's wrong with ya'll ?'
Got these girls in the spot, and I don't care if she a bird or not
Cuz I ain't really trynna talk to ya'll
Got a pocket full of stones, grown with a pocket full of bones
I'm a class act, I follow with the chrome
Lane switching, got your misses on the phone
Baby girl, turn ya head and teeth missing out her comb
Look, I want this money off the books
Little kush, and a Playboy bunny that can cook
You wan't the truth? Man, you f*cking with a crook
But these niggas want the juice, now they f*cking up the jooks
Jimmy Crack Corn, and I don't muthaf*cking care
Cuz the green is the only thing puffin' over here
So be clear, put this bug up in your ear
Meth and Doc put it down, yo, put it in the air
A dude like me, keep a boom boom in the truck
So you hear Doc rolling up
Middle finger in the air, to my haters, yo, what's up?
You can tell Doc f*ck shit up
Hey, nigga, I'm so hood
My hand on the pump, niggas understood
Bitch, I'm no good, I swear
Light shit up like Times Square, put it in the air
I got a bottle of Patron, I'm the only one that spent that cash
But everybody try to get they glass
Now we can all have a drink, if you trying to put some dough in the bank
But if not, ya'll can kiss my ass
I need a, Cinderella that can give me the loot
Better yet, a French vanilla that can give me the scoop
Oh yeah, just so we clear, put this bug up in your ear
Meth and Doc put it down, yo, put it in the air




Turn the beat up a little bit

Loaded, dazed, confused..
I'm in the Esco' rollin' the kush weed
You know that I'm never ever blazin' the Bush weed
You know you're on cloud nine fuckin' with me duke
Be sure that I'm the kush man waitin' to see Proof
Some say I'm high on life and I don't need ya herbs
I'm gettin' high every time that you speak the words
Well I'm glad that means more for me son
I hit the bong so hard they call me three-lungs
They say that I'm the buddah master, "Rock Superstar"
You know the homie with the weed laced candy bar
Now I'm blazin it non-stop, you feelin' me fam?
You see, everywhere I go it's like Amsterdam
We blow the smoke in the air now you smellin' my strain
It's the O.G. bush just clouded your brain
See I'm ready for fo'-twenty mo' honeys get dough for me
All of them Mary, it's scary, they get you most stony


 Hittin' the blunts and bongs
 Puffin' those trees and leaves
 Comin' with E and Vic's
 You know it's on tonight, roll it and pass the light
 Sittin' up top of the world
 Gettin' on top of your girl
 Packin' those bowls and pipes
 You know it's on tonight
 Roll it and pass the light


You know your man's royal can be Ishmael{?}
Wasn't even finished my drink and thinkin' 'bout refills
They got the dro, I'm fin' to roll off these E pills
And I'm the +Proof+, got on my +Method+ so +Be-Real+
A retired weed head that need bread for trickin'
Off on a mission to find bitches for sausage lickin'
Engulfed in liquids, Xena's and perkasets
I jam like I don't know how to work the tech
Nine times outta ten I'm high off the Henn'
Never lie for a trend
Tryna die on a binge
Biscuits is poppin', ain't no stoppin' like Hendrix and Joplin
'til I find out where Biggie and 'Pac went
Profit of coppin', most often is gobbled
Stackin' my chips high 'til they auction a Pablo
Pills to swallow, momma don't cry I send you drugs
Tryna get my mind stuck "In the Middle" like Monie Love - whaaaat?




I semi-automatically spit flows at trash
Anatomically equipped to rip shows in half
If I speak a little fast you get whiplash
Promoters better get the kid cash

Or get whipped ass
Got some Zig-Zags and a Dutch, let's get smashed
My little zip bags got more riders than Six Flags
And while y'all get gassed, I'm proceedin' to get high
Got weed like Mary J. is +All I'm Needin+ to get by
Tical motherfucker, run for cover when shit fly
One hand is on the lye, the other hand on yo' bitch thigh
How many wanna try, Mr. Meth and his clique? Yes
That's kinda farfetched like me passin' a piss test
Okay, let's +Be-Real+, here's the +Proof+, we need cash flow
Might catch me in the movies lightin' up in the back row
For sho', Killa Bee back. Flac? We don't need that
It's fo'-twenty ho, now where the fuck is yo' weed at?
In fact..





Word up, hey, word up, hey
For real doh
Hey, this is Skitle Rock from the Hip-Hop Barber Shop
And once again that was a dedication
Sending out to all my partners percalating in the Windy City
What's up on ya mind? Who's on the request line?
Tell me your name and tell me where you're calling from
Yo, what's up Skitle Rock? This is Shaquera calling from College Park
I wanna dedicate 'Do you want to' by Xscape
To a nigga I was wit last night
He know who he is
Oh no, a, I hope you was checking in
I hope you know who you be
That persons you was wit last night
But that was another shut up from Shaquera from College Park
So you gotta comin' up on the request line
People, please pick up the phone, call Skitle Rock's request line




Greeting, earthlings
We have now taken over your radio


And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low


Going straight to the hole
You ain't got no game
I'm breaking ya out the frame
Coming through like a train
Looking to take over the whole world is my goal
With my unstoppable crew taking all control
You can't get none of this, we're running this
Well taker, earth shaker, 3 point gunning this
Get out the lane, I'm coming through
And if you don't wanna move then I'm coming right through you


It's like inch by inch and step by step
I'm closing in on your position and destruction is my mission
Though eight is not enough, your whole squad better duck
It's like switch when I bust, now your whole crew is dust
Coming through my area, I'mma have to bury ya
The real scream team on your scream scene
It's like showdown on the range
Go tell me who wanna tangle with the ghetto
Witch-doctor neighborhood superhero?


We want it all (all)
Unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore)
In the game, we take you to war (war)
You ain't seen nothing like this before (before)


If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)


Insane like a runaway train, I'm in your lane
Like it's only 3 seconds to score to win the game
Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain
Untamedah, you won't like it when I change
And you are type strange
Megalomaniacal monster in the game
And I got my eye on you
Deadshot aim, as free throws keep coming down like rain
You feeling me, I'm feeling you
The Monstar again, I'm telling you
Pass me the rock, now I'm headed to the basket
Get up out my way is what you better do
My tactics is unsportsmanlike conduct, you better ask it
Don't get no better than this, you catch my drift? (drift?)
You get stripped by ballhandlers ruled by Swackhammer (whoa)
Danger, you're dealing with offical hoop-bangers
With hang time like a coat hanger
Jump, with thunderous 360-degree type dunks
What up doc? The Monstar funk (funk)


Uh, lightning strikes and the court lights get dim
Supreme competition is about to begin
Above the rim, finessing and moves is animated (uh)
Once I get to balling, I can't be deflated (nah)
I'm rugged raw, my Monstars is getting money (money, money)
When clicks get to bugging, I'm snatching up their bunnies, uh
Every step I take shakes the ground
I'll make you break your ankles, son, shakes you down
This is my planet, I'm 'bout business
The best that ever done it, can I get a witness, uh? (no doubt, uh)
Cumulus clouds bring darkness up above
You in it for the money, or in it for the love, M.J.?
23 ways to make a pay
Lounging in the mothership back around my way, uh (uh)
I'm 28 light years old
If the refs get political, dribble like Bob Dole
Am I getting lyrical? Daddy, I think so
Monstar dropping flavor fluid so drink slow


We want it all (all)
Unstoppable, we run the floor (yeah, run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (ah, hardcore)
In the game, we take you to war (turn the music, I'm clean, war)
You ain't seen nothing like this before (ah, yah, before)


If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (we hit 'em high, high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (you hit 'em low, low)
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (we hit 'em high, high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (you hit 'em low, low)


Yo, God bless, pick up your chest (uh, uh)
Here's an example of how I can stress your full court press
With finesse, I bench-press your stress whenever you test
We're speed balling on the fast break
Just like the pony express (ooh-uh)
I'm gon' mingle in your face and take the lid off
Just use your head and forfeit the game
You and your team just need to back off (hah)
Get off my block, give me the ball, I said it's my rock (hah)
I'm starting a line-up by getting y'all to bring the livestock (hah)
Throw all your money in the pot
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot (hah)
When we come right through, tell me what you really gon' do?
We'll leave your team name in shame
And take your talent from you
While you abandon your ship, we take your championship
With nothing left for you to see
Except the instant replay clip (huh)
Money spending, goal tending, stay-bending teams like crash cars
Who do they be? They be the Monstars!


We want it all (all)
Unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore
(what is she talking about? hardcore)
In the game, we take you to war (war)
You ain't seen nothing like this before (before)


If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)

And the boys from Cypress Hill said how I could just kill a man


Already knowin how we go, Let's get at your people

And for the channel, The G code Jeff
Just let the peeps know I'm reppin the east coast, So hold it now


Until my niggas get room enough to breath
I'mma break down the leaf, My brotha crush the weed
Not Puff Daddy, No boy I puff the trees
In a room full of crackers I might cut the cheese
They called me Mr., I got what you need
And a bag of sour dezz, You ain't gotta pluck the seeds naw
So hit the peddle, I'll bring you up to speed
Nearly smashed up to beamer, No more cognac for me
See I'm in my backyard still cleanin
All the fiends still fiendin, Better deal with the demons and
I'm just bein rash, I'm like what's the meanin
Cause as far as MCin I ain't likin what I'm seein man
Nah, So M-E-F's on some other shit
Feel it like that first piece of pussy, Fell in love with it
Yall know what up with it, If I'm with my brother get
Money, Clothes, Hoes, 24s on the mother ship






Windshield, rappers are like gnats
They're gettin' splattered 'pon the windshield
Fallin' down like London Bridge, my blade split your onion head
Axe that like Paul Bunyan, Meth prefers the gun instead
Bong bong, put a hole inside your head


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw


How come the streets don't want me to live?
Plus my niggas keep tellin' me fibs
But the devil done poisoned my wiz
I'm doin' this for my family and kids
I'm tryna be wealthy, take my time right and stay healthy
Said it before but I don't think nobody felt me
Yo tried to understand this hand that this life dealt me
I'm on the verge of a whole new makeover
My fake friends, they can take it like a takeover
I'm ready to eat, I'm ready to grip it
Got enemies everywhere, I got chicks that's wicked
Sick shit, niggas doin' wicked ass wig shit
Bid shit, tellin' jakes that I had the biscuit
Niggas be wantin' my leftovers
I'm like a general that died and lost some of his best soldiers
I burn holsters and I kill that dirt religion
Murk that pigeon and I shoot the television


Got that trey pound on you, run down on you
Hard boiled nigga, Clan top soil
My fam straight royal, I'mma die loyal
When them shooters come for you, better throw your flag 'em
I'm pure gun oil, let 'em see that hand cannon
Foundation strong, never ride a bandwagon
Andrew Jacksons, hand-to-hand transaction
Cops jumped out, caught him with his pants saggin'
Criminal individuals up in here
Wild like the theme park ride called The Buccaneer
Weed in the Tupperware, throw you off the upper tiers
Suweeee, I got all my niggas up in here


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw


Imagine the sound of your face scrapin' up against the gate
Of a barbed wire fence, this is barbed iron fist
Heartthrob, iron dick, hoes slob the nob quick
This is odd, so throw it in your iPod quick


Lifeless activity, constant movement
Buyin' elasticity, such improvement
Sword held to where it collapses inward
Spillin' rhymes if it's Shaolin vineyards
RZA had a mixture, then he added sound to the picture
Co-author rewrote the scripture
Math worked from birth, doubled the net worth
Amplified in the time machine of early Earth
A two-way radio, simple yet complex
Receivers, transmitters, interest to contacts
The emergence of the earliest atoms
Transform to a level extremely hard to fathom
Same soup, different bowl, Wu ceramics
Same group on them large-scale dynamics
A wave triggered the burst, glass was shattered
Galactic matter served on a graphic platter


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw


Overachiever, power hungry overeater
I95, whip fly like an overseer
I'm overconfident but some might say I'm overeager
Or overzealous, especially when it's over cheeba
I got a soldier's features, I rock the coldest sneakers
My sneakers' so cold, can't wear 'em 'less you hold the heater
Can't push me over either, that go for dojas
I ain't got no love for posers neither, keep my composure
I'm focused, tryna roll the reefer, let's turn it up
Forget the cope, I'm tryna blow the speaker, that's all he wrote
One verse could turn your soul to ether
It's time you gave me my respects just like the old Aretha
Mr. Meeeth


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw






Yea, whattup yo, that's right, yeah yeah yeah
I need to be sure, Ayo this your boy Mr. Meth right here man
718 to the 313, let's do it, yeah, my nigga Strike whattup


(Hold up) Before you get your jaw swole up
Take another step, the Mac might bust, see the cops get touched
Squad cars get blown up when you see us coming up, screaming 'what nigga'
(Hold up) Throw your guns up before you get touched
Or you get crushed by D.O.T.'s bust, niggas don't give a fuck
We move like the feds on us, so beware when you see us coming up, screaming


Yo I don't need a bottle of Hypnotiq to get bout it
Wild fiends known for carrying guns and narcotics
I'm a hustla, I fell of my feet and bounced back
I'm not guarenteed if I don't make it in rap
See I don't shoot craps, I shoot cats with M40 Gats
I never been shot, but I been pistol whipped by the strap
Stabbed in the back, best friends turned into rats
I used to smoke weed, pop e and guzzle the yak
But now I stack cheese by all means, gun in my jeans
I move out with a small team, misses and me
AKs with the guns and beans, Uzis and M16
We carry more ammo than US Marines
So if you wonder why people call me the Chief
Some people call me Savager Beast
I corrupted the schools and the streets
When in the other hood, we don't lay heat
Ran up in stores, seizing the cheese
The Mountain Climbaz do as we please




Ain't nothin sweet right here, I got a fetish for this mic phone, forget t
I'm heading for the top, but not without my eagle desert
A little rough around the edges, trick, but give me credit
I'm something like Jerome Beddings, you know the bust
I spit dust, bu there ain't a thing about that's prosthetic
I'm blacking out, call a medic, fuck that anesthetic
Bring on the pain from these cosmetics
MCs that make up none, that's right, I said it
If you let Tical spread it, we can split this head of lettuce, but you
Can't split my Method
I'm copesthetic, now pop another e for evan
I'm well rested for any enemy that you slept with
Tical check it, we serve another copy of the next Meth murder record
All major credit cards accepted
I don't gotta be arrested, or talk about how I'm well connected
To be respected, you know my steeeez




You gon need more killas for guns, more cats on your team
More M16s for redbeans, to try to fuck with this latest regime
I put four in your chest, three in your leg and two in your spleen
See I don't gotta come sell you a dream
Nicknamed Detroit's Spike Lee, I stay on the screen
I got soldiers that live in the mud
Once a nigga break loose, the whole industry is catching a flood
You better back, the general is in this bitch, back up
Before I lift my mac up and make your bones crack up
Don't worry bout trying to act up
Cuz these MCs from the streets will have you begging us to put the strap up
See any spot is out cold, I come with enough ammo to swallow up your area code
And I smash niggas outdoors, when it's all said and done, I earned my
Spot and ya'll paid
For yours






Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump
Troops on the left, fight to the death
Fam on the right, infrared lights
Wolves in the back, ready to attack, for what
Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump


I pop off like a mobster boss
Angel hair with the lobster sauce
Summertime can't top the scorch
Check my hot broad, I dropped the Porsche
FBI wanna watch the force, trying to lock my source
Where I'm from, hear the macs, techs, Glocks and fours
Hide the safe, nigga, lock the doors
No respect for the cops and laws
In the land where your own blood brother still plot for yours
Seen things that'll drop your jaw
My soldiers got dropped in war, see the mural on the project wall?
Won't stop til I copped them all
Wanna block me? You gots to brawl, trade shots and all
Cuz I ain't on the clock for talk
The Spot Rusher, blow down the spot for sure
Still break off the block with raw, my stock is more
The General, watch your board


Deep pockets with the eight on me, sleep with the safe in the wall
The camo's on with the make-up and all
Swap six 45's, twist reefer in the flicks, papi whoadie ride
Bolt his gun off, from know your horse, she lied
Fly criteria, bury me in Africa
With whips and spears, and rough diamonds out of Syria
A true don, only I could do wrong
Rock fitted hats, get crack money and drive a sick blue joint
Retard-less, I'mma blow regardless
Resume is straight up live, I shank niggas up for larger E's
And speak with the youth in the spot, eat the fresh fruit in the crop
All these hip hoppers eat cock
You could see me in the street or the yacht
I'd rather be promoting your block or buying fresh sneakers with gwops
Yo, I'm an ill dude, always been a real dude
Don't fuck around, I will spill on you and kill you in the field, boo


Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump
Troops on the left, fight to the death
Fam on the right, infrared lights
Wolves in the back, ready to attack, for what
Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump


Leather jackets on, rocked up rock stars
Treacherous bank robbers, the plan go dub, we pop guards
The team gotta eat, seeds is hungry, that's why we ain't scared
To dump on niggas, our guns is chunky
Usually we bust niggas down with bats, swell up they joints
Elbow, wrists, they shins get cracked
We still humiliate, brutalize, Ruger pop, pulverize
Still got gear in the closet, that's stupid live
From Benetton rugby skullies, Oshkosh conductor jumpers
The train hats fit me lovely
Rae job is to make sure the coke is fluffy
While I politic his birthday bash with Puffy
Bagged Nia soon as I linked up, the kid ain't inked up
I'm an old mummy, my gold weigh as much as King Tut (yeah, yeah)
Slippers, robes is minked up, under the doorag, bro (uh, yo, yo)
My three dimensional fade is clean cut


Man, ya'll niggas ain't shit to us, still a pistol bust
Split your melon like I split the Dutch
Got a lot of piff to puff, and I ain't come for fisticuffs
Or for the cop that wanna clip the cuffs
Man, is Staten in this bitch or what?
Don't get it twisted, we, twist it up and even mixed with dust
See these fans can't resist the rush, they Wu-Tang for life
Scarred for life, they can't forget the cuts
Got a whole line of classic joints, and while you at it
Pass the joint, let's push this music past the point
Of no return, til it crash and burn, down the ashes
Then placed inside Ol' Dirty Bastard's urn
When it's my time to go, for sure, ya nigga goes to war
What you think I brought these soldiers for?
To send shot, like forget me not, at any nigga
Respect, bitch, that figure they gon' get me got


Heheh, your basic kung fu's no good
You can't move fast enough!
And you don't have enough strength!
And your body movements are like a street fighter!
It's too easy for me to trip you up!
(Fighting sounds)
Heheh, how's it feel, eh?
Ah, it's no good I feel my back's broken!
Heheh, you've still got a lot to learn!



Yo, I hit the 'freeway' after I 'rock the mic'
Light up like Showtime when they about to fight
How bout dat, boy, when that truck ride 38's
Your middle finger up at the light, I'm nice
Doc ride or die, I bubble up when the pouring peroxide
It's dirty, lookie here
Still sharp like I'm back in school
It's like Wonder Blade, cut a nigga smooth
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo, who let the dog loose?
Whips and chains, I don't wanna argue
The big whale that's writing fishscale
Like me, better believe, I'm too hard to harpoon
My goons, think like Chris Wallace
'Give me the loot' and I don't wanna talk about it
When my niggas 'get 'em', that's when I
Crush the building, how about that?
Look at my shoes, how about that, nigga?
(My car, how about that, nigga?)
{Getting money, how about that, nigga?}

(My car, how about that, nigga?)
{Getting money, how about that, nigga?}

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey


How about it, any nigga realer than me? I doubt it
Catch Ready hop out of v, low mileage
You see the way I play with money, I'm so childish
And, so stylish, looking like Gucci my sponsor
Kicks crazy, jewelry is bonkers
Whether in the club or you see me in concert
I go hard, who created a monster?
Me, Gilla be the click that I ride with
Talk slick, get flipped like a Sidekick
You wonder why your bitch is on my dick
Cuz the boy flow doper than five bricks
The MC wishing I simply
Be remembered like Big Pun, Biggie or Pimp C
And when my niggas say 'get 'em', that's when I
Blocka blocka, how about that, nigga?




How bout that, ten years plus in the rap game
And still getting cream like a fat cat
Plus, I'm grossing money off of ASCAP
Plus, my publishing, yea I owns that
First of all, my royalty come quarterly
My hoes, my niggas, all move accordingly
Streetlife, I'm so international
My foreign exchange, but always in the capitol
Straight cash advances, while you be calling
Your label all day, hoping someone answers
I flow with no auto-tone, just me and my bitch
My blunt, my beat, my microphone
I shine with no jewelry on, another star is born
Watch me perform, beyond the norm
And when my niggas 'get 'em', that's when I
Brr stick 'em, haha, stick 'em, how about that, nigga?




I drip game, soak it up, you dig?
Hope your haters want beef, cuz I don't touch the pig
How about that, boy, I'm a G, ain't another MC
Or pedophile that can touch the kid, I do it big
Like Chris Wallace, big bank, big wallet
Got a flow that go straight to the pros, forget college
I still got it, if I got an issue, I flow the pistol
And I'm offical, just like them niggas that blow the whistle
Word, man, I shoot to kill 'em, you heard?
If you nasty, I shoot 'em with penicillin, you heard?
I'm like Cali, so carry, when I'm flipping the words
Flip the script on your bitch ass while I'm flipping the bird
Meth sick with the pen, stick a few in your men
Then again, stick with my people through the thick and the thin
Look, when my niggas 'get 'em', I send 'em to hell
And ride with 'em, how about that, nigga?






Ayo it's too bad, I just crashed a new Jag
Too bad, get your new shoes and boots tagged
You mad, ?wire your brains and dudes mass?
Stack produce cash, my whole crew blast
Niggas think they rich when they boost their stash
Stack on Trick, now I just slap em with dick
And I'm known for getting head in the back of the whip
I'm either with Meth or Doc, Black or Ic
Back to the script, my niggas flash massive chips
While you was home watching the Facts of Life
I was on your block cocking a mac and knife
Trying to stack it right, gold displayed out
Now its platinum or ice, you get your bragging rights
When your cash is right, and if you niggas hold guns, better blast em right
And if you flash your ice, better ante up nigga, or that's your life
Yo, Stack, Ic & Meth flow sick to death
Give it a rest, us three spit it the best
Ice from the charm, fresh trees right from the farm
Every night I got somebodies wife tight on my arm


Yo we can take it to the guns nigga (How do you want it?)
Or we can take it to the knife nigga (Yeah, how do you want it?)
Or we can take it to the hands nigga (Yeah, how do you want it?)
(Not sayin that your woman don't own it like a hornet) X2
(Any way ya'll niggas want it, your paper good perfromance)
(Got cornered, who want it?)


You can catch Meth mashin, pass the cops, harrassin
No classin, spazzin, shot on cash and
Not a penny, I choose a heart away, if any
It's something in me that make me want Moore than Deemi
My man Icarus, S.I., can't get enough
We stickin niggas up for that 'In God We Trust'
Ya'll might fuck with htem, but you can't fuck with us
Don't miss Tical's chamber, I'm too dangerous
And it's been so long, uh huh, been so long
Since I stuck my middle finger past your thong
Bitch must I show & prove, I can't lose
And you don't gotta look at my shoes to see I rule
I do it for my niggas on run from law
I do it for my bitches who boost clothes from stores
Six in the morning, police at my door
Got me locked up, not knowing what I'm locked up for




Yo what the fuck have I done?
Do you see what kind of trouble I've brung?
This what happens when an M outta the W come
Gangsta menage nigga, make you love the two guns
Bust and you run, trust me, I handle them well
I look at whoever called me, cameras held
My right hand hit hard like a hammer to nail
Damn I prevail, from when I used to plan in a cell
Landed in jail, Ic back, nigga, get back
Yo my name ring more than grandfather clocks
While ya'll talk to much like barbershops
Yo can ctach Ic in back of a Widebody 6
Watchin karate flicks and playin with mommy's tits
I admit none of that, I'm the son of the east
I got a gun under my fleece, balde under my teeth
So when a nigga talk shit, I make him run to police
Then I jump in the jeep, put the pump on my seat
What I spend at the bar cost more than your mink
Bartender mad, niggas at me ordering drinks
I'm more than you think, the Benz got a toilet & sink
My bullets will blow at your leg the moment you blink
Tical & Ic, this is the wildest shit
We gon make mothafuckers on the Island flip
Not to mention Stack, his crime fowl is sick
Three real niggas that don't smile for shit





Takin it from the top?
Tippy? Tippy?
How high?
The Ultimate high
'Scuse me as I kiss the sky
Sing a song of six pence, a pocket full a rye
Who the fuck wanna die for their culture?
Stalk the dead body like a vulture
Tical get, blacker than your blackest stallion
Hit your house'n projects, I represent the Shaolin my nigga
Hell yes, 'Apocalypse Now', the gun blow
It be goin' down, diggy diggy down diggy down down
While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
When I raise my trigga finga all y'all niggas hit the decks
'Cause ain't no need for that, hustlers and hardcores
Raw to the floor raw like Reservoir Dogs
The Green-Eyed Bandit can't stand it
With more Fruitier Loops then that Toucan Sam Bitch
Plus, the Bombazee got me wild
Fuckin' with us is a straight suicide
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 Murder 1, lyric at your door
Tical bring it to that ass raw
Breakin' all the rules like glass jaws
Nigga, you got to get mine to get yours
Fucka, we don't need no rap tour
I'd rather kick the facts and catch you with the rapture
More than you bargained for
Tical, that stays open like an all night store
For real, I keeps it ill like a piece of blue steel
Pointed at your temple with the intent to kill
And end your existence, M-E-T
Ain't no use for resistance, H-O-D
I bees the ultimate rush to any nigga on dust
The Egyptian Musk use to have me pull mad sluts
I shift like a clutch with the Ruck
Examine my nuts, I don't stop till I get enough
Your shit broke down, light your flare
Since the dark side tears you into Hollywood squares
6 million ways to die, so I chose
Made it 6 million and 1 with your eyes closed
The blindfold, cold, so you can feel the rap
And shatter the glass and second half on your monkey ass
And yo my man, hit me now
(Tical)
Bitches use to play me, now they can't forget me now
Forget me not, I rock the spot, check Glock
Empty off a lickin' off a hip hop
Fuck the billboard, I'm a bullet on my block
How you dope when you payed for your Billboard spot?
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
It's the funk doctor spock smokin' Buddha on a train
How high? So high that I can kiss the sky
How sick? So sick that you can suck my dick
Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane
Recognize, Johnny Blaze, ain't a damn thing changed
How high? So high that I can kiss the sky
How sick? So sick that you can suck my dick
'Til my man Raider Ruckus come home
It ain't really on till the Ruckus get, home
Puff a meth bone, now I'm off to the red zone
We don't need your dirt weed we got a fuckin' O
Check it, I brings havoc with my hectic
Bring the Pain lyrics screamin' for the antiseptic
Movin' on your left kid, and I'm methted, out my fuckin' dome piece
Plus I got no love for the beast
Hailin' from the big East Coast
Where niggas pack toast
Home of the drug kingpins and cut throats
(Hey boy, you's the rude boy on the block)
(You try and stop the bum rush you will get popped)
As I run around with a racist
My style was born in the 50 stair cases
Dig it, eff a rap critic
He talk about it while I live it
If Red got the blunt, I'm the second one to hit it
Look up in the, I got the verbs, nouns and Glocks in ya
Enter the centa, lyrics bang like rico-chet
Rabbit, I brings havoc with an A-K matic
Rollin' blunts an all day habit
I get it on like Smif'n'Wes
Punks take a sip and test
Who split your vest
The funk phenomenon
I'm bombin' you like Lebanon
Blow canals of Panama
Just off stamina
Styles not to be fucked with, or played with
Fuck the pretty hoes, I love those, Section A Bitches
Hittin' switches, twistin' wigs with
Fat radical mathematical type scriptures
I dig up in your planets like Diga
Boo, scared you, blew you to smithereens
Fuck the marines, I got machines
To light the spliff, and read Mad magazine
I fly more heads than Continental
Wreck ya 5 times like US AIR off an instrumental
Look I'm not a half way crook with bad looks
But I may murder your case like your name was Cal Brooks
I breaks 'em up proppa
Ask Biggie Smalls 'Who Shot Ya'
Funk doctor, with the 12 Gauge Mossberg
Look, I got the tools like Rickle
To make your mind tickle
For the nine nickle
(Yo Red, yo Red)
Punk ass pussy ass
(You ain't gotta say no more man, that's it)
Word up Tical, we out
(It's over)




Excuse me as I kiss the sky
Sing a song of sixpence, a pocket full a rye
Who the fuck wanna die for their culture?
Stalk the dead body like a vulture, Ticalion, hmm
Blacker than your blackest stallion
Hit your housing projects
I represent yo Shaolin my nigga
Now yes, Apocalypse now, the gun blow
It be goin' down, diggy diggy down diggy down down


While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
When I raise my trigger finger all y'all niggas hit the deck
'Cause ain't no need for that, hustlers and hardcore
Raw to the floor raw like Reservoir Dogs
The Green-Eyed Bandit can't stand it
With more Fruitier Loops than that Toucan Sam bitch
Plus the Bombazee got me wide
(MM: Fucking with us) Is a straight suicide


10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4
3, 2, murder 1 lyric at your door
Tical bring it to that ass raw
Breakin' all the rules like glass jaws
Nigga, you got to get mines to get yours
Fuck'a we don't need no rap tour
I'd rather kick the facts and catch you with the rap-ture
More than you bargained for
Tical I stays open like an all-night store
For real I keeps it ill like a piece of blue steel
Pointed at your temple with the intent to kill
And end your existence, M-E-T
Ain't no use for resistance, H-O-D


I be's the ultimate rush to any nigga on dust
The Egyptian Musk used to have me pull mad sluts
I shift like a clutch with the Ruck
Examine my nuts, I don't stop 'til I get enough
Your shit broke down, light your flare
Since the darkside tears you into Hollywood Squares
Six million ways to die, so I chose
Made it six million and one with your eyes closed
The blindfold cold so you can feel the wrath
And shatter the glass and second half on your funky-ass
A yo, my man (Tical) hit me now
Bitches used to play me now they can't forget me now
They get me mad, I rock the spot, check Glock
Empty off a licking off a hip-hop
Fuck the Billboard, I'm a bullet on my block
How you dope when you payed for your Billboard spot?


Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
It's the Funk Doctor Spock smoking buddha on a train
HOW HIGH So high that I can kiss the sky
HOW SICK So sick that you can suck my dick
Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane
Recognize Johnny Blaze, ain't a damn thing changed
HOW HIGH So High that I can kiss the sky
HOW SICK So Sick that you can suck my dick


'Til my man Raider Ruckus come home
It ain't really on til' the Ruckus get, home
Puff a meth bone, now I'm off to the red zone
We don't need your dirt weed, we got our fuckin' own
Check it
I brings havoc with my hectic
Bring the Pain lyrics screaming for the antiseptic
Moving on your left kid, and I'm Method
Out my fucking dome piece, plus I got no love for the beast
Hailing from the big East Coast, where niggas pack toast
Home of the drug kingpin and cut throats


Hey boy, you the rude boy on the block
You try to stop the bum rush, you will get popped


As I run a mile with a racist
My style was born in the pissy staircases
Dig it, eff a rap critic
He talk about it while I live it
If Red got the blunt, I'm the second one to hit it


Look up in the, I got the verbs, nouns and Glocks in ya
Enter the center, lyrics bang like Ricochet Rabbit
I brings havoc with an A-K matic
Rollin' blunts an all-day habit
I get it on like Smif 'n' Wess'; who clique's the best?
Punks take a sip and test, who split your vest
The funk phenomenon, I'm bombing you like Lebanon
Blow canals of Panama just off stamina
Styles not to be fucked with or played with
Fuck them pretty hoes, I love those Section 8 bit-ches
Hitting snitches, twisting wigs with
Fat radical mathematical type scriptures
I dig up in your planets like Digga  boo
Scared you, blew you to smitha-reens
Fuck the Marines, I got machines
That like to spit and read Mad magazines
I fly more heads than Continental
Wreck ya five times like U.S. Air off an instrumental
Look I'm not a halfway crook with bad looks
But I may murder your case like your name was Cal Brooks
I breaks 'em off proper
Ask Biggie Smalls Who Shot Ya
Funk Doctor with the 12-gauge Mossberg
Look I got the tools like Rickle
To make your mind tickle
For the nine nickle




Yo, ladies and gentlemen
We got Toni Braxton up in the house
So high that I can kiss the sky, bitch
We live up in here, y'all; let's get high!
Motherfucker, get high!


Tical shittin' again, spittin' to win
Loaded guns, clip in the end, none sicker than him
Yes, indeed, I'm ill as any STD's or sex disease
These dirty rats want extra cheese
On that piece of the pie
Now ask me "How high?", I'll tell you "Reach for the sky!"
Blame the Crooked Letter I
That's my home, 23's wrapped in chrome
Not only snap on y'all niggas but I'll snap them bones
Clap your dome, make you leave that crack alone
You got the key to the city but the latch is on?
I gots it locked, bringin' the noise, bringin' the Funk
Doctor Spock, bringin' my boys, bringin' you lungs
Pop the Glock, but only if you feel this shit
Jack the Ripper; don't make me have to kill this bitch!
Back to get ya, put it in check, that's the Mista
Meth with his wood on your neck, shut your lips up


I, I get so high
Smoke cheeba cheeba, smoke cheeba cheeba
I, can touch the sky
I'm so high that I can kiss the sky sky
I, I get so high
Brick City and The Crooked Letter I
High, high, high, high
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get


You can call on the man when the party is borin'
I'll have these hoes strippin' till it's part of the mornin'
I love a fat chick with a body enormous
It ain't about the weight, yo, it's how they performin'
My dash is 180, my weed half a pound
When the smoke in the air my nose like basset hounds
I don't stash the 'dro, nigga, divide
I'm that nigga that ride with trigger to give a supply
High is how I stay all the time
(Method Man: Niggas, close your doors!)
Yo, bitches, shut all your blinds!
If I'm hard to find, take two puffs and pass
I stay back, but my Benz moved up a class
It's Doc and Meth, the format is real sickenin'
Contagious, we out for Mr. Biggs' women
You better shut your trap when my dogs around
We pissin' on fire hydrants, so walk around, bitch!


I, I get so high
Smoke cheeba cheeba, smoke cheeba cheeba
I, can touch the sky
I'm so high that I can kiss the sky sky
I, I get so high
Brick City and The Crooked Letter I
High, high, high, high
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get


Mista Method Man, puttin' in work, foot in the dirt
Like it's all good, roll through your hood, pushin' a hearse
I wish y'all would come around like Clint Eastwood
As if you're reppin' your hood in my neck of the woods
Street gorillas in the PJ's, grimy bitch
I wear the same shit for three days, find me lit
Blunt sparks, like Phillippi; fuck the he-say, the she-say!
Adjust the microphone, plus the clich


Yo, call me the Bob Backlund
I'll break backs on hoes that look like Toni Braxton
Come run with these boney masked men
I'm out the gutter, I'm out to send your baby mother
Out for rubbers; we fuckin' tonight
Bitches wanna crowd around, how I'm cuffin' the mic
I'm a gorilla, leave a banana stuck in your pipe
Cause I'm a real block winner, the Doc inna
Bitch, one of my balls bigger than the Epcot Center!


I, I get so high
Smoke cheeba cheeba, smoke cheeba cheeba
I, can touch the sky
I'm so high that I can kiss the sky sky
I, I get so high
Brick City and The Crooked Letter I
High, high, high, high
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get




(E. Sermon: Latest record? You stole it from somebody else)
Takin it from the top?
(Hell yeah, we taking it from the top)
Tippy?
All my people 
Hey, uh

(Fly Robin Fly)(Repeat 3X)
(Up, up to the sky)


Excuse me as I kiss the sky
Sing a song of sixpence, a pocketful a rye
Who the fuck wanna die for their culture
Stalk the dead body like a vulture
Ticallion, HMMM
Blacker than your blackest stallion
Hit your housing projects
I represent yo Shaolin my nigga
Hell yes, Apocalypse Now, the gun blaow
It be goin down, diggy diggy down, diggy down down


While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
When I raise my trigger finger all y'all niggas hit the deck
'Cause ain't no need for that, hustlers and hardcore
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs
The Green-Eyed Bandit can't stand it
With more Fruitier Loops then that Toucan Sam bitch
Plus, the Bombazee got me wide...
(Messin' with them) is a straight suicide


Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
(It's the Funk Doctor Spock smokin' (lah) on the train)
How high? (So high that I can kiss the sky)

(Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane)
Recognize Johnny Blaze, ain't a damn thing changed
(How high?) So high that I can kiss the sky

3 2 Murder 1 lyric at your door
Tical bring it to that ass raw
Breaking all the rules like glass jaws
Nigga, you got to get mine to get yours
Fucka, we don't need no rap tour
I'd rather kick the facts and catch you with the rap-ture
More than you bargained for
Tical, that stays open like an all night store
For real, I keeps it ill like a piece of blue steel
Pointed at your temple with the intent to kill
And end your existence, M-E-T
Ain't no use for resistance, H-O-D


I shift like a clutch with the Ruck
Examine my nuts, I don't stop 'til I get enough
6 million ways to die, so I chose
Made it 6 million and 1 with your eyes closed
The blindfold, cold, so you can feel the wrath
And shatter the glass and second half on your monkey ass
Ayo my man (Tical) hit me now
Bitches used to play me now they can't forget me now
Forget me not, I rock the spot, check Glock
Empty off a lickin off in hip hop
Fuck the Billboard, I'm a bullet on my block
How you dope when you paid for your Billboard spot?


Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
(It's the Funk Doctor Spock smokin'  on the train)
How high? (So high that I can kiss the sky)



As I run a mile with a racist
My style was born in the pissy staircases
Dig it, eff a rap critic
He talk about it while I live it
If Red got the blunt, I'm the second one to hit it


Look up in the, I got the verbs, nouns and Glocks in ya
Enter the center, lyrics bang like Rico-chet Rabbit
I bring havoc with an A-K matic
Rollin blunts an all day habit
I get it on like Smiff and Wess
Who click's the best?
Punks take a sip and test
Who splits your vest?
The funk phenomenon
I'm bombin' you like Lebanon
Flow canals of Panama just off stamina


Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
(It's the Funk Doctor Spock smokin' (lah) on the train)
How high? (So high that I can kiss the sky)

(Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane)

(How high?) So high that I can kiss the sky





When it comes to a secret, maybe, if you down
I got a man, yet I'm known to sneak around
Huh, I just can't help but mingle
If a cutie steps up, a think the fuck and say I'm single
I'm down wit runnin' games, I know it's a shame
But when I kiss, I never give 'em my real name
I'm not a hooker, but I'm the good looker
Known to flirt, lookin' good in a tight skirt
Now I'm back to my man, and help these begin
And know how I'm sorta messin' wit his best friend
We were first introduced at a party
Okay, I admit that I was naughty lookin' at his body
Prime example of a typical chipmunk
My booties kinda thick so you know I'm pullin' niggas quick
Look but don't touch, no need to rush
We can get together if you kept it on the hush hush


I won't tell if you won't tell
Nowadays you gotta keep it on the hush hush tip
(I won't tell if you won't tell
Nowadays you gotta keep it on the hush hush)


If he doesn't know, how can it hurt?
My mans should of known from the jump, that I'm a chick, no nut work
Why do you think I got the name N-Tyce?
Why do you think all the fellas be lookin' twice?
I am what I am and that's a fly chick
People compare me to Rick because I'm so "slick"
Now check it out, I was coolin' wit my girlfriends
Walkin' by mad guys, gettin' more whistles than a whirlwind
Yeah, that's what we was hearin'
Walk a little closer, baby, as we were starin'
At this one and that one, I spotted this fly kid
It was my mans best friend starin' weak in his eye lid
Yo, I must admit that I was shocked
I mean, my man's best friend sneakin' up on my jock?
Could I get caught? I think my chances were slim
I mean, yo, what's my man got to do with him? Heh






No rings on my finger, so I'm cheatin'
Coolin' wit my man's best friend, now, trick
A freak can do wit a thought, that ya best friend would sneak
Behind ya back, every week wit ya girl in his sack
I'm not dumb, I knew that was the plan of my man
To test me, to see if I would kick it wit his friend
But, um, I'm a tough act to follow
When it comes to runnin' games, call me Chicago
Matter fact, there ain't a brother that can hang
Didn't, now ya know, that N-Tyce is my name
You try to play me like a Genesis
Now it's time for me to step off, I gotta put an end to this
I can have my cake and eat it too
But, you both get the boot, huh, lookin' for someone new
You got played, now you want me to keep it on the hush hush?
Another bites the dust




Shh, Method dog, we out, Tical
(Sneakin' behind his back, sneakin' behind his back, uh
Sneakin' behind his back, sneakin' behind his back)






Ma, Ma, throw down some money
The ice cream man is coming


Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
And scooped in my ice cream truck, who tears it up


Yo honey dip, summertime fine, jewelry dripping
Seen you on Pitkins with a bunch of chickens how you're clicking

Two-finger rings and gold teeth and ain't afraid to hold heat
So when I step in the square dear

Double down some time, Ice Cream you got me falling out like a cripple
I love you like I love my dick size
Ooh baby I miss you, your sweet tender touches
Take pulls off the Dutches
Orgasm in my mind state, masturbate in your clutches
I want you for self like wealth, so play me closely
Chicks are at each other for the sting, who want the most of me
Only a hard dozen wanna be calling me cousin
Thirsty for my catalog, baby shopping spree you're loving
Call me if you want to get dug like the pockets
I jism like a giant, break wombs out of the sockets


Wu-Tang in the cut, for real niggas what
It's the afterparty and bitches want to fuck


Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts

Ice cream!
Ice cream!
Mom!
Throw down some money!
The ice cream man is coming!


Brothers don't know how to flow, like "oh
Shit, I can dip
I'm a hip hop pro"
Who wanna get fucked, the hunt that bucks the buck
Viva like a squirrel, and get a nut, niggy nut
Over huffing, puffing
Blow me like down and
Inside, outside, bring me back around
And bam!, out the fucking sky like shazam!
You don't know, I tell you who I am
The drifty, shifty
Killer rhyme swiftly
So much funk, the method true
Let's get lifty
Not dusted
Cause that'll wreck your mental
Thus get me flustered, looking Oriental
That's when I'm Fu Manchu from the Wu-
Tang!, put me in the chamber, now bang
Zoom!, to the fucking moon I boom
Don't crowd my mic, alright, give me room
And I'll show you holmes, how a Meth should be born
Cuz when I flip God, I'm as hard as a stone
Rolling, rolling, rolling
Bitch I'll have them pussy lips swollen!
On the trigger
Your bigger
Now how you figure that
My click got more figures
Than you got nigga naps
And curiosity, what, killed the cat
Satisfaction, brought that cat back
And I'll come back, as the Attack of the Killer Tomatoes
They nothin' in the morning like H.O
Yo
Got to go, Got to go!
Ima stop it
And drop it like so!


Ma! Ma!
Throw down some money!
The ice cream man is coming!


Do ya
Do ya
Do ya
Do ya
Do ya
Do ya danger!
Here comes another Wu-Tang head banger!
Straight from the panty, ante, man
And brother can you dig it, like my man Digger Dan
When I shoot that clip, I be trigger happy, man
Never comb my hair, keep it nigga nappy, man
Give me a light to spark the bone, true
I can be the microphone, one, two, check
The Method, make me wanna wreck shit for
Wu-Tang squad, keep it hard to the core
Midnight hour, fresh out the shower
I be man, He-Man, I got the power
To get ill, pardon me as I show my skill
And still, I got too
Real
On a lyric, on it, raw deal
Then it gets fat
I guess it wasn't on the pill
Like Cypress Hill said
Well "I Could Just Kill A Man"
Fill it full of lead, nobody can get iller than
The jack mover, word up, it's a stick up
Try any fancy moves, you get licked up
By the majestic smoker of the method
Bone, and I'm known to like
Wreck shit well!






This is little Kane though
His little sobrero
(The ice cream truck is back mothafucker!)
(Check out this shit)
Yeah uh-huh (What?)
Eh yo.. eh yo eh yo

Caramel cover girl, love the way your body twirl
French vanilla cream, body work is mean
Chocolate fudge make a nigga wanna fall in love

Heels on, with the fat coochie
The way it's feelin' you seducin' me
Take time, create, yeah my legend is straight now
Ya inner vibe's the side of the juicy
Cheeba queen, treats on, jeans, state to state
And she got the nerve to fuck me all mean
While I rock all green, by all means
We in the mall fiendin', one more hump then I'mma scream
Boo throw me more of you, I'll take all four of you
We could flip it on the floor while I'm pourin' on you
Make me kiss it in the store on you
Cop the new drawers, the dick is all yours it's a mornin' blue
Straight mines, thats a warnin' duke
Watch me climb, that pussy looks shaped and designed
Yeah, line for line, rhyme for rhyme
That coochie is mine, I might just need it this time




Shut the fuck up and get in the car
Girl, your high beams is on, I wonder how they fit in that bra
We in the front seat, splittin' cigars
I'm on my job so you handcuffin' ho ass niggas, be on your guard
Especially on ladies night, I like it when they take a swallow
Straight out the bottle, but that ain't lady-like
I call 'em lil' pet names like Ma and Boo-Boo
So everytime I see your girlfriend, never confuse you
With the next down-ass chick, that play a part
That's cool enough to pardon my French menage a trois
Meth Man, real talk, don't mean to put you on the spot
But I know a spot to kick your heels off
I'm not as Dirty as that Bastard, be
But still a villain, I serve 'em Dick Dastardly
Here's a little taste of Ice Cream II (Ice Cream II)
So put some Vicky Secret on, trick, I might swing through




Yo, I love my dick-size, like I love women and shit
My head grew over these years, now I got a nice dick
Beauty mark right on my balls, girl, have a nice lick
Cute in the face, hair-do, you got some nice lips
Pussy monkeys holdin' my cock, just like it's vice grips
Part down the crack of your ass, your frame is priceless
Butter-butter caramel swirl, chocolate chip
French vanilla sundae girls, banana split
Cum drip down in your chin, right on your soft tits
Put your hand gently in mine, give me a soft kiss
What's really good? Girl, slip me your number
You blowin' up, and your lookin' Ice Cream this summer
Better than Beyonce, Halle Berry and them
Honey, you lookin' scrumptous, I ain't worried 'bout them
You my straight hood chick, girl, you more than a gym
You got that fat tight pussy like Notorious KIM
Butter-butter caramel swirl, chocolate chip
French vanilla sundae girls, banana split, uh..

When the twins track on, you can't talk you bark on it
Doc's yo' walf on it, sometimes get lost on it
America's Most No Time a Car woman
Timberland's and Nike Air's in the fog runnin'
We job huntin', with no I.D.'s
Plus my coke carry all the minerals I need

Like in-door hot beat, it's war when I bleed
Sugar come here, throw that ass in the air
I leave blood guts and, broken glass everywhere
I write with "bear" hands, but I'm a gorrilla
Broke out the zoo, with Mystikal and my nigga
Fuck y'all for wrong me, I'm inside of a Ridder
With fat chicks arguing, Who's body is bigger?

Niggas wanna test my steez, nigga please

In your tracks, a Wu-Tang (bzzz) killer bee's on ya back
I comes for the honey plus the phat money sack
You want it all? Yeah I want it all like THAT
I stab my own moms in the back for a stack
Niggas like, "Damn, why you want it like that?" (Why is that?)
Cause I'm a dog, and I got no love for the cat (uhh)
Attitude's cold like the North polar cap
Where I do my dirt's a little further down the map (Is that so?)
A little buck wilding, Island called Stat'
Where niggas carry gats in they Black Moon hat
Now I'm mad known for the bones and the rap
And you's an unknown with a faulty contract
Wake up and smell the Met-chod motherfucker contact
Villain in the cypher from the foe when head crack
An Indian giver and I'm out to take it back
Shaolin Island, baby where you at?
A runaway train that be runnin on ya track
That's how it's goin down, yeah, it's goin down like that

I gets my thang in action
To live, to love, to see, to learn
Yo! Tell em what's happenin!

(What's happenin?
I'll tell yo' ass what's happenin
Tell em what's happenin
It's goin on out here - brothers ain't got no peers
And they smokin funny - shuddup yo' damn mouth!)


I swing funky rap routines and tap the jaws
Spot ya twenty points and you still can't score
NUTTIN - cause you ain't got no points in this game
Kid you FRONTIN - I'm home run hittin, you be buntin
Fresh out the toilet, I got my shit together
When I'm good, I'm good, when bad, I'm better
You want it? Whatever - I'll be the stormy weather
Rain comin down, so weatherproof you're leather
JACKET, a nigga with a AXE couldn't HACK IT
I spark em like a match (ssskt)
Coming back it's the Met-chod, say it loud
I'm the Met-chod, Man - clap yo' hands, now check it
See me in the mix, rollin fat, bustin flicks
While my physical brother came through and got me lift
Niggas, that I walk by, give me the eye
The moment is fuckin me up, killin my high
Nigga get back, ya pussy cat, I'm fearsome
Basically THAT, I'm all of THAT, and then some
While I, was out on tour, goin beserk
I heard you was at the sandbox and kickin DIRT
All on my name but you can't pull my file
YOU DON'T KNOW ME, AND YOU DON'T KNOW MY STYLE
Comin out dere like dat dere, YEAHHHH
Even Grizzly Adams couldn't bear

(Ahhheheh, I taught the boy everything he KNOW
Go on you bad motherfuckers
See I told you that kid go back to that Dolemite
Everybody needs to love Dolemite
I love Dolemite, you love Dolemite
Hey, how you doin nigga, I know you
Knowin I didn't when I did
Meth-Tical
Shiiit, I told the boy
If you can't get yourself a ten
The least you can do is fuck five twos
And we out, Method)




Ay, aiyyo Meth

Y'all motherfuckers got like (damn)
Two minutes to get to the motherfuckin bar nigga
(Y'all already know the business nigga)
Ha ha


Yo, I walk in pimpin when I'm up in here
Pulled up the G ride then I'm up in here
I ain't worried, I got mad muh'uckers here
And my advice stay at bay like a buccaneer
I feel good when I walk inside
All eyes on the bro that's NBA live
The A.I. of rap, these haters gon' try
To shut me down but I, fly, high
A hood fella always gotta keep somethin close
A gutter flow like mine, gotta let 'em know
I'm Xxplosive like Dre Next Episode
Check my file baby, this is the mother-load
Take off your heels (yeah) and shake your hair (yeah)
A nigga like me weavin through e'rywhere (yeah)
I taste like new money, make it clear
Baby, tell your friends that we right HERE!


I know what some'in is - you don't know what nuttin is {*3X*}
I know what some'in is - you don't know what nuttin IS~!
(You don't wanna see me shine)
(Talkin shit, on the low)
(Hate to see me in the sky)
(Flyin high, high, high)


Yeah yo, yo
Who them dudes smellin like trees when we up in here?
Straight Gilla and Killa Beez when we up in here
Kush nigga, I keep the weed in the tupperware
Fuck security, V.I.P., we can puff in here
Niggas know how we do it (yeah) I ain't buyin the bar (yeah)
I'm tryin to talk her out her drawers, she tryin to charge
I ain't tryin to ball
Don't spend no money in the club, if I said that I was I'd be lyin to y'all
I gotta have it, an addict too and I'm puffin
You'd rather hate us, discuss it, no more discussions
The head of the house is now speakin, the food is ready for eatin
Your head is ready for beatin, I'll kick your teeth in
Don't fuck with Tical - you know a nigga black out off a couple beers
Smoke up an ounce, pass out like a couple years
And mami doin her thing, she in her underwear
You join the team and now win, I'll put you under there




Yeah, yo
You know you smell mad weed when we up in here
A wild boy like Steve when we up in here (hey!)
And haters, they smell cheese when we up in here
But when we up in here, y'all know nothin here!


And you know how we get it in when we up in here
Women smellin like cinnamon when she up in here
And haters, they pay the fee to get up in here
Meth and Doc, man these MC's don't want nothin here





You're all, I need
To get by, ahhhhh
You're all, I need
To get by, ahhhhh

Lie together, cry together, I swear to God I hope we fuckin' die together

Shorty I'm there for you anytime you need me
For real girl, it's me in your world, believe me
Nuttin make a man feel better than a woman
Queen with a crown that be down for whatever
There are few things that's forever, my lady
We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nothin
You made a brother feel like he was somethin
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no frontin
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say "Baby it'll be okay"
Now that's real to a brother like me baby
Never ever give my booty away and keep it tight aight
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a phat-ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'ma make sure we
Be livin in the effin lap of luxury
I'm realizing that you didn't have to funk wit me
But you did, now I'm going all out kid
And I got mad love to give, you my nigga

Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny
With you I'll spend my time
I'll dedicate my life
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life for you

Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny
With you I'll spend my time
I'll dedicate my life

Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own
No need to shop around you got the good stuff at home
Even if I'm locked up North you in the world
Wrapped in three-fourths of cloth never showin your stuff off, boo
It be true me for you that's how it is
I be your Noah, you be my Wiz
I'm your Mister, you my Mrs. with hugs and kisses
Valentine cards and birthday wishes? Please
Be on another level of planning, of understanding
The bond between man and woman, and child
The highest elevation, cuz we above
All that romance crap, just show your love

Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny
With you I'll spend my time
I'll dedicate my life
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life for you



You're all, I need

Intro: Method Man

One time..
Huhh, all up in ya like a bone when I
Johnny Blaze, the Iron Lung
Foxy Brown, the Ill Na Na (yeah, c'mon, yeah, c'mon)
Destination... (c'mon, c'mon) plat'


Yo Na Na so Ill, first week out
Shipped a half a mil, niggas freaked out
She's all about sex, pard-on, check your facts
And the track record, I'm all about plaques
Shaking my ass half naked, lovin this life
Waiting for Kim album to drop, knowin it's tight
Standing center stage, closin the show holdin a gat
Since you opened up, I know you're hoping it's wack
Niggas, screaming my name on record straight whylin
Maybe I'll answer back when you reach a hundred thousand
This is ladies night, and the Mercedes's tight
When I'm coming home? Maybe tonight
Leave my food by the microwave, kiss the baby goodnight
It's my time to shine it's playtime tonight
I'mma try to stand my ground, know when I fall
I left your ass Home Alone, hopin I call



Who's got the illest pussy on the planet?
Sugar walls comin down niggas can't stand it, the Ill Na Na
True Absolut Vodka, straight shots
For the has-beens and have-nots, dolla dolla
Real and it don't stop, we moving up
First the mansion then the yacht, sound proper
Straight cash get got, bloodhounds
Tryin to hunt down the Brown Fox, the Ill Na Na


No more sexing me all night, thinking it's alright
While I'm lookin over your
Shoulder, watching the hall light
You hate when it's a ball right? Ladies this ain't handball
Nigga hit these walls right before I call Mike
In the morning when it's all bright, eggs over easy
Hope you have my shit tight when I open my eyes
While I'm eating getting dressed up, this ain't yo' pad
I left some money on the dresser, find you a cab
No more, sharin I pain, sharing I made
It's time to outslick niggas, ladies sharing our game
Put it in high gear, flip the eye wear
Nas Ruled the World but now it's my year
And from, here on I solemnly swear
To hold my own like Pee Wee in a movie theater (uh-huh)
Yeah I don't need a man's wealth (yeah)
But I can do bad (bad) by my damn self (self)
And uhh..



Uhh... vodka..
Not... not..
Dolla dolla... stop stop..
C'mon c'mon... yah, it's the Ill Na Na


No more Waitin To Exhale, we takin deep breaths
Ladies take this over, I be Fox so peep this
Love thyself with no one above thee
Cause ain't nobody gon' love me like me
If he, don't Do The Right Thing like Spike Lee
Bye bye wifey make him lose his Nike's (uh uh, yeah)
Hit the road
Mommy told me in order to, find a Prince
You gotta kiss some toads






Straight up, nigga
Brick City on fire, nigga
We on fire, nigga
(Beast shit) yeah
(Oh yeah, my mic sound real nice, check it)
(Yeah, uh, ok) yessir
Hot off the press, yo, yo


Check out the, main attraction, black man in action
The orangutan that remain a captain
You need a boost, I'm the right Vein to tap in
Cuz hip hop is lame, the whole game is lacking
I make my commission off, weed and shows
Chicks wanna spread rumors like Club Nouveau
But I pimp it like my ruff-ruff-ruff-ruff, we don't love them hoes
Each flow that I'm spitting sound malnutrition
But it's phat when the clip in, boy, I mean business
We got beef for the teeth of soy bean niggas
Redman & Method Man, stay in the lab
America meet the new Tango & Cash
Hip hop is in trouble, I stay on the path
Rappers wanna feature me, I'm like give me the math
I'm like "nah", I'mma keep it funky, nigga
Talk 20, cuz for money, I'm a junkie nigga


I'm dope, nigga (yeah, that's what the say)
(Frank Lucas with the pen, get at me, ok?)
I'm dope, nigga, dirty needle stuck in the arm
Hustle til the package is gone, never tuck in my charm, cuz I'm
I'm dope, nigga (nodding out to my dope
(Nino Brown takeover, that's how I roll)
Now let me smoke witcha, hard when the kid on the job
Keep a step ahead of the law, push the peddle and floor


I got that small change, my nigga, quarters, nickels & dimes
I might cop a little shine, favorite pistol, a nine
I can't deal with fickle minds cuz I'm too official with mine
Put your nose in my notebook and go 'head sniff you a line
I'm dope, nigga, I'm heroin in it's prime
While the game is on it's decline, bitches on my define
I find rhyming easy, but I ain't easy to find
Number one on my to do list, please believe me, it's crime
Ain't with the tom foolery, Meth, if you don't know that
I'mma vet or what to do with me, yet, go 'head and Google me
Your boy flow fluently, yes, still got that Wu in me
Screw it, let me do it to death, minus the eulogy
Ah-hah, I'm ahead of the game, ahead of these lames
I'm a head case, the head nurse is getting better with brain
Let me network, the rest of you niggas stay in your lane
Know your net-worth, now back to the script, like I was saying


I'm dope, nigga (yeah, that's what the say)
(Frank Lucas with the pen, get at me, ok?)
I'm dope, nigga, dirty needle stuck in the arm
Hustle til the package is gone, never tuck in my charm, cuz I'm
I'm dope, nigga (nodding out to my dope
(Nino Brown takeover, that's how I roll)
Now let me smoke witcha, hard when the kid on the job
Keep a step ahead of the law, push the peddle and floor


The hip hop Yogi Berra, New York, let's get together
It took a '90's boy, to flow in your era
Niggas never saw me when I write, and signed in a letter
I was born the son of Helen Keller
My skin is Old Yeller, but a bitch dig a fella
She like the way car wheels flip the propellers
I 'stay fly' like Three 6, someone tell her
Doc & Meth tough like Run-DMC leather


I'm the king of rock, dimes, grams and ki's
Cuz the world don't give a fuck if I got a fam to feed
This a heroin dream, smash up a fiend
You can see this pack in my jeans, put you back on your lean
Yeah, back for a fit, back on my shit
Got my ex from back in the days, even back on my dick
This is crack shit, ya'll do it big, I super size
Coke Classic, my nose in the 'cane, like Super Fly, cuz I'm


I'm dope, nigga (yeah, that's what the say)
(Frank Lucas with the pen, get at me, ok?)
I'm dope, nigga, dirty needle stuck in the arm
Hustle til the package is gone, never tuck in my charm, cuz I'm
I'm dope, nigga (nodding out to my dope
(Nino Brown takeover, that's how I roll)
Now let me smoke witcha, hard when the kid on the job
Keep a step ahead of the law, push the peddle and floor




Yeah, yeah
A-yo, a-yo
The I-N-T-E-double-L


Its like Im trapped inside a cage
I cant explain this type of rage
Its not a moment or a phase
But possibly the end of days
Watch as I stand up on the stage
Not as an artist but a slave
Deep inside my subconscious
My music keeping me sane
They say its levels to the shit, I say its levels to your brain
You cant acquire the higher, youll always remain the same
Regardless of all the money and bitches yanking your chain
What good is a private plane to a man who cant walk the plains
Hip-hop is now gen-pop, populated with lames
Attacking you with these frequencies meant to destroy your brain
Im fitting to go supernova expose em to super-flames
Soon as I pick these locks on these psychological chains
The answer is in the question the question comes from the pain
And the pain is just electrical signals sent to my brain
But the brain is just a box where information remains
As I try to remain a soldier, the voice in my head explains


Im still shadowboxing lungs and oxygen
This an icebreaker, no bubblegum was popping
Another hot concoction trick, ya might need amoxicillin
The kids too sick, you're gonna need shots to kill em
My method is ill, Doc admit him
When I see you, ICU can get em
Your boy give em bars until the judge acquit him
The court cant convict him or find the gloves to fit him
Thats OJ, I mean OK, I mean, Im not kidding, no play
Jealous ones still envy, thats Jose
Peace to Cartagena, I flow hey
But I dont speak Spanish, yo no se
Im a seasoned veteran, obey
Obtain a freestyle, its cold pay
The old me, resort to my old ways
My old man was stuck in his old days
Still he wanna blaze like John but rapping aint in his forte


Look how we did it to ya
Yall just dont get it do you?
Special deliver to ya
This is how we give it to you
I'mma get it to ya (x4)
What rapper spit it truer?
But they dont live it, do ya?
My shooter cock the Ruger
This is how we get it to you
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)
I'mma get it to ya(RAW)
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)


It was only the elite who could walk these streets
With jewels and not get stuck, niggas didnt give a fuck
Real Gs know Im talking about
Taking what you making, stripping what you wearing
Caring about nothing
Gun barrel in your face, cold steel on your cheek
This is how we meet and greet, enemy across the street
Leaning on his Rover jeeps, smiling, showing all our teeth
Seeking son in my hood, it aint all sweet
And you havent earned the respect
Of those who come, creep and take money
So you just food that niggas come eat
And they dont get no chain back
You might see em rocking that
Fuck you looking at? Problem needs solving
You see that big 357 thing revolvingrevolving


Yeah, you niggas aint street, my money talks word of mouth
I figured you out the life I live, youre not about
Price on your head, Im taking cash advances
Ill take my chances, then deal with the circumstances
Livin off the land like a land shark
Im on the lamb like the gyro with the white sauce
Idle times a devil playground, make moves
Watch me kill your whole vibes, crush groove
Hands high, say hello to my little friend
Point the finger at the bad guy, its me again
Who are they to criticize me? I do it like a G
Im a nigga from the motherfucking streets
Throw me in the fire, watch me bubble
I was built for the struggle, my knees never buckle


Look how we did it to ya
Yall just dont get it do you?
Special deliver to ya
This is how we give it to you
I'mma get it to ya (x4)
What rapper spit it truer?
But they dont live it, do ya?
My shooter cock the Ruger
This is how we get it to you
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)




Shout out to Morocco, what's going down?
This your boy, MEF, Mr. that is
Capital M, capital E, capital F
I'm here to speak upon things, one of your hometown favorites
My boy Cilvaringz, doing big things upon this
We gon' make it pop like this
Ya'll wanna see what time it izzy
Man, this is in the name of Allah
RZA, Shabazz the Disciple, Masta Killa
Killah Priest, your boy John-John Blazini
Let's do it


Listen, the wise elder spoke, write as I quote
Then open the seal, and reveal these things
That will come to pass, if you can last through the storm
Man will be tested in all forms
Then flesh will be beaten until submission
Forgiveness has been given to spare your life
Still your eyes glaze when you greet my wife
Sinful thinking, it's strong wine and drinking
Lead to the destruction of such men as Samson
The grace period given for those who will repent
Those other than righteous, Masta Killa will send
And time is at hand, as I walk the land
From the U.K., back to the streets of B.K
Given sight beyond sight, to write the unseen
No amount of treasure can measure the gift given
To speak the unspoken, it's the chosen


I need one cup of Dracula's blood, two virgins
Dressed in all black, to start my sermon
One heart of a merchant, one teeth of a priest
The head of a monk, mixed in a bowl, with the 9/11 souls
I see him in the sign as the reverend was told
I read the scroll, but I'm still blindfold
Wait, I need more ingredients, so I look for the seeds of disobedience
Chop off the foot of Bush, throw him in the pot, let him cook
To every word I jot in this book, I pray the FBI's overlook
The recipe for America's destiny
Tech will squeeze, after dragging, I stab him in the abdomen
Free the Palestinians, free the Africans
Free humanity from the insanity, our planet bleeds
Mission cycles of symbols and idols
Our skin put Bibles, Qu' Ran, been through temples to old mosque
Stepping through the Garden of Eden where the revengeful angels throw rods
Oh God, save us from the outrageous Pagans, I spray guns, til the barrel's empty
I'm like Moses to Pharaoh's envy, turn of the century
Burning in misery, think...


In the, name of Allah, who we give thanks and praises
They turn us from the wages, watch over your saviors
He gave us life, made us upright and raised us
He wrote the book, we live according to your pages


When the holy father spit, you see the bottomless pit
Demons rise out, Shabazz close the door, this God's house




Titanium fangs, skull nearly mammal
At the holy city of Mecca, on the back of a talking camel
Grey Flannel Cologne, crazy ammo get blown
Wherever I sit son, that is my throne
I'm the reason why time started, I be the kind hearted
Trying to bust me, you aiming at a blind target
Designed with a sublime for the vintage
I control the whole, don't deal with no percentage
Even with a 3.5 mil deposit
Your life is still illusive like a CGI composite
Where your mind and your body discombobulate
Need to regenerate, let your mental seed ovulate
For nine months, in the womb of my wisdom
You may find a program to descramble the system
And cause a glitch, whether bright day or black pitch
We strive to build homes, and stack chips
From the ice of Alaska, to the heat of Calabasas
We over through the master, he build our own castle
Remove the impostor, take it up an octave
As my vibe continues to energize your chakras
Out of Allah mercy, I speak these verses
To help bring the truth from beneath the surface
To help get the proof, from beneath the churches
Defeat Shaitan, and complete the circle


I move with a strike of elegance
Like Saladin on a horse, backed by seraphim
Where flowers open and my past and unruled is downhill
But see, I'm quick to the back
The fate for the house of Mecca, the stone of Abraham
My word alone will enslave a man
Deeply to the sword of Islam, though he resides with his mom
In the Pagan land, the shit's calm
Praying to the cross of Christ, what is right
But the Qu' Ran claims Christ never lost his life
To the crucified punishment of Roman justice
And that's why the Bible cannot be trusted






What up Prince Rakeem, Masta Killa, Cilvaringz
John Blaze, S.T.D., in the name of Allah
(Yo, yo, one-two, one-two, turn my mic up a little bit
Turn the headphones up just a little bit
Turn the frequency up a little, yo...)




Intoxicated and I'm faded, by your honey
Why, we finally made it, got to lovin'
Money, seeds and shine
They want to hate it, try to break it
But it's yours and mine
Nothing can change it, finally made it, so divine


Yo, I sat around the illest villains
Campaignin' while we all G off
Automatic mayors, now we ain't playin'
Wolves start scheemin', violate me in the rain
Get more respect, rob Marvin Gaye on 'em
Gold, black, beige on 'em, heavy gauge
Gettin' blazed, all that money, but he ain't even shaved
This a new flavor, bigger vets, bigger begets
Bigger papes, god damn it, nigga got saved
Three or more, two thousand four Blazers
Lookin' good, it's all hood, just analyze amazed
Peace, let's mozy and swaze', y'all
Then count real bank and thank 'em, hit me on the page, what



Yo, I was born on the same day as Dr. Seuss
Plenty of friends, henny and gin, who got the juice?
Let's get drunk, in this motherfucker, let's get pumped
I need that funk, like I ain't took a bath in a month
You can find me where the thugs be at, club be at
A fact, I love women, 'cause they love me back
The name's Johnny, they used to call me sucker for love
But now I'm grimey, cops searchin' motherfuckers for drugs
Give me that buzz, that calm a nigga, dimes and doves
At four twenty, when niggas knew what time it was
A shot of Remy, in my system, I'm buzzed
Then baby, I ain't just a little war from unplugged
Haha, you know I, crack myself up, sometimes with no excuses
Like every nigga that done time, I didn't do it
Meth the Magnificent, not Jeff
I see the game done gone imputent, soft and suspect



Yo, silence on Smith with six shots, lick shots
Leave ya head like a Shaolin monk with six dots
Hit a gush, twistin' a sweet switcher
In search for Bobby the Digital, bitch, not Bobby Fisher
Head full, with a Grey Goose and Redbull
I came for, a beer, weed, plus a bed full
Of dimepiece, model type bitches, who mind they business
Blow my dick, like birthday cake wishes
My warrior's scornful, hard to respond to
Dirt McGirt, be sailin' boat and in Honolulu
Brooklyn Zu, wild like Chaka Zulu
Brooklyn Zu, shots will go right through you
Touch me in Cali, or the streets of Mauwi
In the two thousand six pitch black Audi
Drivin' by bitches, I'm like howdy
Doody, to you some beauty bitches crowd me






Intoxicated and I'm faded, by your honey
Why, we finally made it, got to lovin'
Money, seeds and shine
They wanna hate it, try to break it
But it's yours and mine
Nothing can change it, finally made it, so divine

Starring Wu-Tang Brother #1, the M-E-T-H-O-D Man
AKA Johnny Blaze, AKA Hot Nix, the Iron Lung
Big John Studd, Johnny Storm, check it out, yo

And sit back and Johnny Blaze take you on a ride to the other side
Peace to the Wu-Tang family, ten years strong
Forty million albums sold, platinum and gold
And the sage continues...
Yo, pass that blunt homey, let's fuck these niggas up real quick


Aight... let's do it...




Make marijuana legal, make marijuana legal
Make marijuana legal, make marijuana legal (well speak your mind then)
Ok, I will, no one has the right to tell me what I can do with my own body
What I can eat, drink or smoke, this is a free country
And no one can take away my constitutional rights
Hey man, can you put me on and I can say anything I want
Is that what I need to do? (Yea)
Then why isin't alcohol made illegal? Why isin't that
While you drinking it, it hang on and disposes your liver
Besides that, it's a habitat for alcohol
Besides that, cigarettes are much worse than pot
No one ever got killed by pot (you tell 'em, you tell 'em)
God damn it, man, everything, you can get us anything you want
(Anything you want, marijuana legal
Make marijuana legal, what's so bad anyway
What's so bad about feeling good?
There's nothing wrong with blowing crack, yea!)

Stop, look & listen, guess who coming up?
And y'all was dumb enough to think that Method's number's up
Pockets so fat, they need a tummy tuck, you hungry fucks
Can sum it up, I give my money up, spit at a honey
Then split a honey Dutch, roll it up, can't roll with us
If you can't hold your liquor, throw it up, y'all know what up
See we them niggas, ain't no ho in us, the flow is nuts
I'm off the meter, momma wished that I was off the reefer
But, for now, I got this game up in the cobra clutch
Plus, the silverback gorilla swigger, shot of Tequila to the gut
Nigga, trust, I got that Killa up
What y'all ain't feelin' us? Ain't feelin' ya
When half ya niggas posing similar, yea
Ladies and gents, I think this game need a enema, yea
It's "common sense", I Used 2 Love H.E.R., now they pimpin' her, yeah
But if you Enter the Wu-Tang, you tripping
Like somebody tied together your shoestring, now listen
I'm the, real deal, come on, come back to get ya like bad karma
Y'all niggas is throwing rocks with glass armor
Fuck the court system, pleading the fifth
And if Def Jam is deaf, start reading my lips
I'm cocky, possibly I got my reasons and shit
They ain't built a man that can stop me from feeding my kids


And if you don't know where I'm coming from, never know where I be in
Most likely, where ya start at'll be the place where you eating
And anybody hating on him, hating on them
That's right, anybody hating on him, hating on them, motherfuckers


How could you ever say that I'm washed up
When I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
4:21... The Day After



What's good. Staten Island stand up!
This right here - Staten Island artist
Done by Staten Island, made in Staten Island. Enjoy
Fuckin' Meth Heads...

Piece of the wu tang family
Ten years strong forty for your albums sold
Platinumb gold and the sagas continue

(johnny blaze)

Alright lets do it




Yo... yo... yo... yo, yo


Time to knock 'em out, cut 'em with the glass hand
Time to shut 'em down, I'm coming out the badland
Oscar the Grouch, kid, jumping out the trashcan
The last man that violated, got chopped with the sword
Send him a one way express ticket to see the Lord
You think we falling off, the beef's internal
All that bullshit we going through, it don't concern you
I'll thermonuclear burn you, you'se a human sacrifice
Cuz I be smashing mics with the Passion of Christ
Stay fully loaded, equipped with action devices
Kid, stashing these stripes, join the force
Honey, take ya flick, lift and point to the boss, soon
As you blink, your coins is tossed
It only takes four bars to get my point accross
And I'm cold as winter frost, on top of the mountains
Elijah, was the prophet, along came Malcolm
And I'm scalping niggas, taking devil's heads
Money generated, niggas taking heavy bread


I was born in a barrel of razor blades
Right next door to haze, I used to be afraid
Of the devil, as a boy, but now as a grown man
I realized, he is just a toy
A grafted image, of the magnificent splendid
Dominant, prominent, Islamic
I was here before the dinosaurs, shine and defining law
Measure every inch of the Earth, combining more
Elements and chemicals, fire, space, and minerals
Kept devils on the run, like Monk-Monk the General
Appear in a gang attire, slept in a ring of fire
I, got a bigger beat than Billy Squier
Dirty Dick Dastard' dart, straight out the dungeon
Transform on niggas like the rail whip from London
Paul Bunyan ax tracks, get peeled, caps back
Hard to get out, nigga, head like naps
Parental advisory, no M.C. is wisin' me
Me and the mic, like, ebony and ivory
We go together, like, cheese and cheddar, like
Jeans and sweater, like, Mo' and better, like
Who could take a sun ray, twist it to a rainbow
Darts sit upon your head like the Kangol
V is for Victory, I mastered your trickery
Tryna clock like dickory, get smoked like hickory
So please stop the bickery, you can't get rid of me
Wu Killa Bee, from now to infinity


Look at this bitch ass, snitch ass, about to get a kicked ass
Get mad, get smashed, and get another zip bag of 'dro
For these ho niggas, slow niggas, told niggas
Fucking with the coal miner's daughter, she a gold digger
Killa, I'm back iller, been realer, chinchilla
Coat, ex-crack dealer, cap peeler, dope
Uncut coke, cut throat, niggas had enough dough
What up, though? My nigga, I don't trust no bitches
That's real shit, feel this, vanilla Dutch and steel lick
Forensics is still tryna figure how I killed it
Wu-Tang, my crew bang, let our nuts hang
Like that piece on a new chain, mami, pop the poontang
Your party, find me where the stars be, or probably
Walk into the corner store on Targhee
Smokin' Bob Marley's, I'm hardly, a nigga to be fucked with
And you tryna 'catch up, but you barely cut the mustard, aight then


Just another spine chiller, U-G, RZA
M-A-S-T, A-K-Illa, M-E-T-H, O-D gorilla, straight from the Killa
Brownsvillah, do or die Bed-Stuy
Murderer, East terrorist, we clap gun thunderist
Land of the Iron Gods, swords can't live
Medina stay warrior, how can I escape the block
From being boxed off, lost in the shuffle of life
Living right cost, legendary crime boss
Fresh kicks drip in the street, beautiful unique
Freestyle, be so wild, fresh out the Penal
Track it on the Pro Tools, foul, smooth as blue nile
Wave spin, water blend, dart flow, sun glow
Kool Moe Dee roll, gang up on a power show
Snoop never love a ho, bang it on in your vehicle slow
You don't know how the God be flipping the style
And keep it so, Witty Unpredictable
Truth or Natural, the Gods is actual
It's a fact, I was destined, to grab the mic and bless them




Uh... yeah, y'all, guess whose back?
Heh... cauli' flavored, momma crack
Yeah... yeah... Scott Storch (Return of the great)
Mr. M-E-F (aww shit) know what I said
Black people don't use the T-H, yo (got it fucked up now)
Yo, yo...


Guess who back though, crack dough, yes, eyes is hat low
Stash 'dro, pimp on the side, you know how that go
Rap flow, major, taste the flavor, all natural high
Y'all gotta love it when the track go (track go)
Ask Def Jam what's hot, three letters, M-E-F Man
Been stopped, that's off top, young, fresh to death
And you're not, no matter what the job, I'm the best man
Rap C.E.O. minus the yes-man (yes-man)
I know that's right, so act right, Staten on the map
Like fuck y'all, get stuck, y'all and have a bad night
As I brush off my shoulder, that's right
My nigga Scott Storch keep bringing it back like (back like)
Oh boy, dig it, I talk about it and I live it
Been there, did it, shitted and wiped my ass with it
These critics saw the train for brains and must of missed it
If they ain't got the shit, they'll never get it (never get it)


Is it me, or is it these, niggas in it for cheese
Is it me, all my enemies, hating on Killa Beez
Is it me, or is it me, that ain't feeling M.C.'s
With the top down, wheeling the v, feeling the breeze
Is it me, or is it these, niggas spitting the same
Is it me, all my enemies, throwing shit in the game
Is it me, or the industry that really got to change
Once again, it's Wu-Tang, in case y'all forgot the name


I spit germ, early bird gets worm, now
Now that it's his turn, clowns don't get turns, now
Fuck with a chick perm, when she get hot, you get burned
You see I'm not kidding, knowing these kids learn (kids learn)
And and I'm that dude, ahh-choo, and allerging to wake jewels
Blast if I have to, and y'all don't give me no hassle
Who rep Rotten Apple to death and get natural
Make hard beats pound like the track do (track do)
If you ask me, this raspy voice nigga is nasty
Khaki's hanging off of his ass, eyes is glassy
That's fucked, that's us, niggas know where to catch me
At 1-800 GET-AT-ME, (get at me)
My, flow's, no holds barred, Holy Jahad
It's the head nigga in charge, Meth, back on the job
Like back in the days, back when, the game was hard
And when they reminiscenced over Wu, my God




Until these rap niggas stepped up, checked up, man this game is messed up
Next up, you know what it is, don't get it f'd up
Meth, what? F.Y.I., you need a heads up
And I don't mean to beat you in the head, but (head, but)
When you spit that, forget that, I eat these niggas food
And the shit wrapped, where Cliff at? Tell 'em Mr. Meth got his shit back
The gift back, sign, sealed, delivered and gift wrapped
And when you hear that click-click (click-click)
That's real talk, some niggas will talk to the cops
Get killed off, man how did you get caught with all the rocks
And still walk, no matter what you mix with a pig
You still pork, and money is still forced (still forced)
Yeah, that was right on cue, new and improved
All these dudes try'nna walk in my shoes, doing my moves
But that's cool, cause I'mma make it do what it do
With this W, like I can I get a "suu" motherfuckers?



[Outro: Method Man
W-T-R-B...
Wu-Tang Radio, Bitch...




Digital master


Uh Oh like Lumidee, if Meth ain't that shit by now, I'm soon to be
When I choke hold mics, I don't give em room to breathe
I'm just doin me, but bitch if you fine, I'll do you free
By now if you don't know who it be, don't make me tell
Just know I Killa Mike like that kid from ATL
If you fail to plan, baby plan to fail
Man my game ugly as that nigga Sam ???
I'm so funky, I can't even stand the smell
Come on, life's a drag, roll it up and inhale
Don't get comfy, I cramo your style like a monkey
Even +Deemi+ needs +Moore+ than Ashton Kutcher to punk me
My four five barks
Just one shot is enough to clear the block like it's time for 106 & Park
Staten Island dropping your ass, we mean business
With guns that put a shot in your ass like free clinics


Everytime we drop the top it don't stop
Everytime we pop the Glock it don't stop
Everytime we rock the block it don't stop
As long as the product good, they gon cop


It's the bar barbarian, big butt carrying
Hittin urban areas from ??? to Maryland
My Lincolm Navigate, my name on the plate
My name is J-Ro, biatch, get that shit straight
No time for those who hate, I'm too busy putting dinner on the plate
And rocking old Chevys with the candy paint and gold flake
Hail to the land of earthquakes and real niggas and fakes
The 'Ro rocking with the Method, you might as well accept it
My flow is so killer it'll probably get arrested
I'm bumpin Bob Marley, sippin hobbs and barley
I'm old and dangerous like poisen calamari
Don't fuck with Likwit, but you didn't believe
Now your ass in hot water just like a teaf leaf
Everytime we drop the top, here comes the cops
Everytime we rock your pop, the bottles pop




I run through tracks like Maurice Green
KB I Mean, more to life than the air you breathe
Cheese, get a piece, I been part of the streets
Sweet liquid, my niggas will chip part of your teeth
Big beats like bloa, wow
They call your boy the golden child, I flow for miles
Classic, better check my foul
I'm not the one, been on the run, blow my lungs animal style
I'm a wild son of a gun, sign of the times
I'm the king, so the prince my son
That's one, get punched like clocks and chumps
Pop the trunk, watch me stunt, you flinch, get jumped
I'm sick everyday of the month
No cure for sure, I'm the nigga they want
Spit raw, so everytime you bite my style
Just remember that it was J-Ro, KB & Meth Tical, nigga




Shouts out to EP, Big Bonzi J. Wells, Liquid Entertainment, for all you haters
Please turn your radios up as loud as they go



You know I'm bout it bout it
What?  Huh?
You know
Huh?
It's like, you don't limit yourself to one thing
Your mama
Got to broaden your horizons
Broaden your joints
Keep your eyes on the prize
The struggle goes on
Eryday (ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha)
Eryday
And I'ma live it through my music
(ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha)
You know how we do
Choose or lose from it

Verse One: Method Man

Pull your shoes up, don't get stuck
Or get your frame struck, when my squad blitzin
Hittin like Mack trucks, head splittin paper written
In windy cities like Chicago, no bullshhhh
You see me spittin at the kitten with the lost mitten
As we engage in cold war gettin frostbitten
Once again up in these stank drawers baby listen
One mind and for one cause, heavy hittin
The penalty illegal ruffnecks, we bring ruckus
In pursuit of gold lines, can a n---a touch it
If I can't see ya can't truss it
A shady character like Buzz Buzzard
Lay him out like a plush rug-ged
*mimicking Brand Nubian* Now you can love it, or leave it alone
We drink death and puff bone
Draggin your body out the end zone
And any way the wind blow that's where you flow
That's why you be the first one caught, last to know
Body layin out on the flo', substitute
Heavy players from the run and shoot, we open do'
Third and long, quarterback pack the cannon on
I go deep he drop bombs, *whistle* that's when I touch-down
Six points, what now?
Once again who comin through in the clutch now, perfect strangerous
Ever since I came with this, and wrecked a body
You convinced like Lombardi, that Johnny Dangerous
Offensive shotgun
Calm in the pocket I got one, in the milli gun
Deep threats to chose from, that's how it goes son
You win some you lose some, it's in the game

You win some you lose some (uhh!) that's how it goes son (yeah)
You win some you lose some (uhh!) it's in the game ... (yeah)
You win some you lose some, that's how it goes son
You win some you lose some, it's in the game

Verse Two: Ricky Watters

From the football field
(It's in the game
You win some you lose some, it's in the game)
To the mountain, yaknowhatI'msayin?
(That's how it goes son, that's how it goes
You win some you lose some, it's in the game)

Freestylin, profilin, won't catch me smilin
Straight from Fema Island, buckwhylin, I'm stylin
A funky type of style with the lyrical incision
S--t locked down, like my n----z out in prison
Good riddance, keep it hidden, up in my knapsack
Sippin cognac, while I vibe off this funky track
Yo bring it back, or make it hit harder
Infiltrate your mind like Nino at the Carter, but smarter
So drop harder, if you wanna conjugate
Verbs and nouns, make it profound as I pound
In your earpiece I'm the beast
To say the least, we must increase, the peace
But keep it real, so I can feel, the skills
Funky fresh rhymes I will build so I kill
And thrill, lyrics spittin, through my lips
Doin backflips, it's another hit
Come take a sip, of the running Watters
Lyrically I slaughter, mentally I author
The rhymes that you feel to the map
Crushin double barrels, sing em out like carols
Who it be?  It be I, the n---a with the chinky eyes
From NY, city we committee we gets busy
With killa beez on the swarm
Lyrically we storm, mentally a lord
Verbally I bomb (boom!), guard your grill
It's the man that chill, run for the hills from Grassvile
Drillin rhymes straight on tracks and double cuff
Another TV, and they loved it

(You win some you lose some, that's how it go son
You win some you lose some, that's in the game
You win some you lose some, that's how it go son
You win some you lose some, that's in the game
It's in the game
You win some you lose some, it's in the game
It's in the game, it's in the game, it's in the game, it's in the game)




Now I walked on ice, and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
Judge a phenomena, deadly but calm world in my palm
Dead by dawn got the right to bear arms, bring me along
Another sound boy dying, hot iron
Stuff flyin, out the hardware appliance
Baby, Momma Crying'
Sobbin' and grievin', you was at odds
With them kids, till they made it even
Let down your guard, yes you did
Now you barely breathin'
To win a whim, open season on a duck
We don't give a what
Yo, best, best to give it up
Joe and D, lets run these MCs, they phony
From Humphrey, they made Bogey
Saddle up your horse, there's the sunset Mosey
Jam-Master Jay deserves a trophy for this track right
Futuristic G past tight
If that's your girlfriend, she wasn't last night, punk
Little boy style's is mad chump, ain't no wins here
Sport is extreme, know what I mean
Gettin royalties, Down with the King...!


Uhh, uhh
If Im gonna rob, ima rob all night
If Im lookin for somethin its probably a fight
If Im goin fuck bitches then they better be tight
If thats dead, then the head better be right
If I gots to play ima play til I win
Since I gots to be here can't wait to begin
Wanna fuck shorty can't stand shorty friend
Cause honey friend fuck many many men
Stay wit the rats cause the rats is real
Wanna fuck, then we fuck, already know the deal
Shit, fuck what you look like, just show the real
And I keep A spot that we can go to chill
I love my, get down for the hoes
Only reason I come around is for the hoes
Pipework - I lay it down for the hoes
Hit em off with that dark brown, you know?


I'm on a path not thinkin bout a average man
Black Sedan my way through pitfalls and scams
Let the whole world know about this Likwit king
Programmed to ignite on site
So now I'm standin in a whole new light (whole new light)
In a area where niggas ain't tryin to fight (tryin to fight)
I feel my jaw get tight (jaw get tight)
It's like, these niggas get pumped up, and lick shots
At you, and yours, plus the motherfuckin cops
We got, blocks and blocks of non-stop hustle
21 backdrop, it's my turn to shuffle
Stay alert little pussy on the side can't hurt
Wear protection from the heats, so I don't get burnt
I got no time to be a star (*echoes star, star, star*)
I go straight from the car to the bar, and then get busy
Whenever provoked, I react like Bill Bixby
Incredible heat, X-to the-Z
And 'The Infamous' Mobb Deep, take it to the street
Don't waste my time (waste my time)
Tryin to disrepect me in your half-assed rhyme
(half-assed rhyme) that ass is mine
Been goin down like this since the beginnin of time
Eyes may shine




Yo, most of the time, yo, I'm flicked up
Stepping out the crib like I'm sixed up, don't get it mixed up
Even if I'm shaking your hand, I'm still gripped up
With two spots left, yeah, we still bricked up
Trees pine, gleem no seed, young boys feeling they self, they must be on E's
Me? I stay yachted out, boating on oceans
He banging my old chick, and he mad open
Think I smell the goons, they been business since the Tunnel days
Shanks out, they ready to move
Somebody yelled out 'ballin'
In two seconds, lord, they was up on 'em
That boy should of slowed down, baby
Now what we gon' tell his lady
Jaw on the floor, looking all crazy
A lot of vicks been going down in here, lately


In 2012, the DJ is still recognized as the crowd controller
The record breaking, keep the bottles popping and all the ass shaking


It's that Wu shit, it's that movement
It's the Wu shit, in the house


Yo, should I talk about all the jewels I wore on my neck
While you had to tuck your little shit in out of respect
I'm a don, rebel out of Staten Island projects
I dare ya'll to come in my projects
Leave with no head, no neck
You thought I was Flex, the way I bombed the set
In the hallway, banger house, smelling like cake
Tongueing bitches down, most of them got scraped
Watch how I move the crowd, I'mma make 'em, make 'em clap to this
No shit, no doubt
Two shots of Hennessy, ladies want Goose
Earlier them fronting niggas, now they want a truce
Mami got a bubble in her Jimmy Choo shoe
When I go and kick it, she's a goodie two-shoe?
Yeah, right, daddy got bread
Like J. Holiday, I wanna put you to bed
Tell me your girlfriends, kicks, don't let it go to your head
Walking around in your cheap ass threads
Get away from me, stinky




Yeah, yo, I spit lines from the rubble room
Bottom line, I kick mines, like a mother's womb
I'm, still in my prime, fuck them other dudes
No biting's the rule, but we can eat each other's food
Flash a camera at the all time great
Single handing increase New York's crime rate
That's why I love it in the Empire State
The city where your fat ass can still find weight
But ya'll ain't getting it, the game is different
And in the recession, a lot of veterans is quitting it
Every day I'm living it, your boy got blunts
Fighting after school, a lot of ya'll got jumped
Staten Island, bruh, ratchet under my coat, potato silencer
And we silencing that, just every day challenge us
Check a nigga out of respect, I'm spectacular, this the Massacre




Once upon a time not long ago, I heard Run D.M.C. on the radio
Tape deck and record. Suit and valor. Popping & locking on the cardboard
Fell in love with Hip Hop no question. D.J cut the rucket, I get aggressive

One love to the God Inf
In my heart baby, one, one
Stapleton, the Wild West, Park Hill (we gon' freak
This shit like this)
Port Richmond, Now Born, Jungle Nilz


I'm screamin' long live The W
I see you fools through the same as my brothers do
Now can somebody tell me who let them dogs out
And watch these villains tear the roof off they dog house


Who got that champagne, got that remy, got it good and plenty
Who only got a few friends, and they not friendly
And to scrubs, I might just blackout and blow your lightbulb
We turn night clubs to Fight Club, that's what happens when you invite thugs
The bouge function with haters and busters
And big head Hollywood hoes, let's get the fuckers
Guess who, you like Meth who, now let me show you what the tech do
Spit when he talk, and word wet you
It's the return of the su-super sperm
Mackin', lovin' my perm, have ya, fling out that burn, bitch
If you don't know me, then you better know my flow
Meth Jigga what, Jigga who, jiggalo


I don't usually do this, but keep the party going (uh-huh)
I don't usually do this, but keep the party going (nigga)
I don't usually do this, but keep the party going
Yo yo'ing, yo, yo, yo, yo'ing




Is it the fortune or fame, that make y'all change
Got Milton Bradley hatin' the game, playas hatin' the same
Y'all know his name, no need to mention or to explain
What I've been through, how I get down, or why I came
Let's talk about this flame in my mouth, I can't contain
Some weed pocket change and some brain I can't complain
Now, I heard y'all ladies got them thang thangs, do you really
Park Hillbillies, come from down south, slap ya silly
So what the dealy, with them Dutch Masters, really yo
Backwoods, and niggas that make herb with illio
Backwoods, and niggas that make herb with illio
I swear these niggas don't know they ass from they elbow
Don't know that I'mma strike, short of a shelltoe

Whatever gets you by, everybody in here, high
You can drink it or smoke it

First, there was the collapse of civilization, anarchy, genocide, starvation. Then, when it seemed like shit couldn't get any more fucked up, we got the Plague, the Living Death, closing his icy grip around the whole planet. Then the rumors started, the last hardcore MC's were working on a cure, that would end the pestilence, why? I like the death. I like the misery, I like this world!! Space, the Final Frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Tical


As I walk in the shadow of death
Sixteen men on a dead man's chest
Your host this even Mr H-O-T
N-I-X, you get splashed with the Tec
Nobody go 'til the God say so
You got a second or more to run for the door
Before I blow back off the map, contact
You didn't know Stat' could get down like that
Who want them test rocket launcher, yes
Mr. Meth, hold the fort, most def
Cats is dead wrong, song's too long
Get swung on, can't we all get along?
See my pinkie, see my thumb
See that kid with the pump shot gun?
Bust your gums, leave your whole shit numb
Hmm, now what's this? Smell like fish
Mr. Big Mouth, the gat be trout
You need to douche out your style no doubt
Johnny struck through the Shaolin slum
Prum-prum-prum on my Shaolin drum
Niggas don't dare to step in the square
Kids ain't playing over here, playa
Only one way, and that's my way
Grim Reaper calling, Judgement Day


(10) Ten let the countdown begin

The name of this one is Judgement Day
No more B.S., can't come out and play
Don't blame me, blame society
Type of chemistry for a live MC
Hands in the air like you just don't care
You all get a share, there's a party over here
Year 2000, keep bouncing
T-Minus, thirty seconds and counting
New York's finest, still wilding, Shaolin
At the full moon howling
Get 'til it's gone, Killa Bee kills
Only time will reveal like the words in the song
Cause love's what I feel for my crew, bust steel
Niggas don't got to pay my bills
P.L.O. pack the slingshot flow
Plant the seed, let the garden grow
And stick that rhyme where the sun don't shine
Darts pierce your heart like a Valentine
This my Tale From the Crypt that's sick
Bloodbath, body bags and shit
UFC fighting championships
G.I. Joes with the Kung-Fu Grip
Now you don't dare, to step in the square
Kids ain't playing over here, playa
Only one way, and that's my way
Grim Reaper calling, Judgement Day

* This is an alternate take from the promo version of "WWF Aggression"


Ah-ahhowwwwwwwwww!

We are... here...
To lay this boy... to rest...
And so shall you...
Be put, to death...


Beware of the six-six-six
So morbid and twisted I'm sick, sick, sick
Mad and sadistic, dark like sun when it eclipses
Grab your crucifixes and RUN...
From the hellfire fiend, The Big Red Machine
Heads get chopped in the guillotine, burnt in kerosene
Now you don't believe in the unseen
By any means necessary back to the cemetary
IT'S KANE!

Chorus: Method Man

Unstoppable, unconquerable - impossible, unstoppable
Unstoppable, unconquerable - impossible, unstoppable (It's KANE!)
Unstoppable, unconquerable - impossible, unstoppable
Unstoppable, unconquerable - impossible, unstoppable


I rise from the tomb
A quarter pass midnight, full moon
The theme music kicks in, you'rre doomed
Soon comes the bell, it's me against you in a cage match cell
You get a chokeslam from hell
LOOK OUT!  Great balls of fire, no doubt
My flame can't be doused, this is what pain's about
Lock all the doors and the windows in your house
Night of the Grim Reaper, tales from the Crypt Keeper
IT'S KANE!

Chorus


Feel the tombstone piledriver
You hit the floor, thankin God you're alive-ah
Hail Mary take no prisoners and no survivors
Found scary like a convoy of drunk drivers, ahhhhhhhowww
Tragic, that old black magic
A-tisket-a-tasket, a coffin or a casket
Grateful Dead, nightmares that make you wet the bed
Visions of bloodshed dancing through your head
IT'S KANE!

Chorus 1/2

{*Method Man grunts and growls*}

IT'S KANE! (2X)

Unstoppable, unconquerable - impossible, unstoppable
Unstoppable, unconquerable - impossible, unstoppable

{*Meth babbles on until fade*}




Word (These mothafuckin' niggas, man)
Yeah, I hear that, you got that shit, right?
(Yeah, I got it) Lemme hear it
(I'ma two-way Sunn back right now
Next time she show up right on time for this shit)
Word, no doubt
(Better stop smokin' on that shit)
Fuck that, hey, don't do it with him
(Whatever)
Yo yeah, lemme get that mothafucka's sayin' on this, nigga
(Yeah, niggas be buggin' in here
Nigga don't speak no fuckin' English, word?)
You get me everything? (I got you a cheese joint)
{Diamond buscuits, mothafucka!}


Now let's see, we don't get down like that
See, he holds his own, haha, he holds his own
Haha, he holds his own (Bank!)
(John Blizzy) {Straight like that}
He holdin' twenty on this
(Ghost Deini) {Uh-huh! Yeah!}
(ShaCronz) {The invincible, baby)
Bad boys (Suga Bang) {It's like that!}
(D-Digi!)


Spontaneous combustion got niggas lustin'
Fuckin' with this head bustin' track spanker
Decaffinator, crab sinker, twenty-five
Tryin' to live to see my forty acher, before I die
Immaculate conceptions like loaded weapons
Shootin' up ya rap session in mere seconds (Bluh! Bluh!)
Ya whole style is undressin'
Try to hide yaself behind the R&B section
And got spotted, fuckin' with them fake artists who make garbage
Now ya like a human target with no direction
And no protection, rap nigga assed out and no question
Dead and buried, we holdin' like the military
Fuck Dog Shit, hide-out beats and hot cherries
On virgin mic's, style very cri-Tical
By any means necessary, mad lyr-ical
The Ghostrider, want vengeance on you style biters
Ya whole sect got you gassed 'til I sparked the lighter
And burnt that ass like Dhalsim in Street Fighter
I play the shadows, scopin' out you lime lighters and Desperados


Killa Beez is ridin' East to West, baby
See our twenties spinnin' on our trucks, baby
Diamonds, Cubans hangin' from our neck, baby
Come on, come on


{Baby cuz It's Not a Game}
You see them mothafuckin' twenty-inch chromes spinnin'?
{Rocked out, baby, ice hangin'}


Bailed out from drugs, almost retired from bubblin'
Hammers was the guns under the rug, lift off my publishin'
Jet to Miami, I chuggle-lug the beat
Fiends beepin' me, I erase and delete (Come on)
Surrounded my palm trees and sound-proof condos
Tryin' out Spanish foods, Roberto's bangin' bongos
Do whatever, crackin' down weather, it means nice
Walkin' down the strip, these fat niggas broke the ice
Drive it in a host, the trucks, the gate's wide open
A square box fell out, I'm hopin' it be coke and
I snatched it, dipped into a parkin' lot and wrapped it
See diamonds, pearls, rubies, gems, covered with acid
Heavens to mega-troid, infants'll know I'm paranoid
What she goes through, I'm on a next flight to St. Croix
Sneaker boy and Genius, I heard he struck oil
Him and Masta Killa own Fox and mad loyal


Diamonds, Cubans hangin' from our neck, baby
Come on, come on


{The finest, baby, the finest}
(You see them Linx hangin'?)


Yo, yo
You know I rarely fight, I keep heat plus I'm very nice
I run with two-eighties on me like Jerry Rice
I fuck with many birds, not the canary type
I've seen a lot of happy days and scary nights
My click hotter than fish grease, kids be diss-free
Most of these labels can't handle this heat
I love new twat, scrap ho's on a few blocks
When my hate grows I let the tools pop
A lot of these rap niggas be fast to plea
Raw cook up, Got the Hook-Up like Master P
F.G., we don't talk, nigga, fast to squeeze
Walk up and let a hundred shots crash ya V
The first to pull out, the first to body somethin'
I got all the heat all the shorties in ya lobby pumpin'
Them dudes you standin' with probably frontin'
Killa Bee Gang got that shit that keep ya hottie jumpin'
What?




{Straight like that, baby, it's nuttin' less, K.B., baby
Don't forget it, C.C.F.}
You see the shits spinnin'?
Come on, nigga! {Clamp on, baby} Come on!
Yo, yo, tell them niggas, son
What? What?
You see the shits spinnin'? {Yeah}
Shit hangin', son, they hangin' {Better catch it}
Come on! Come on!


Straight gangsta
(Yo, you've just been experiencin'
Wu-Tang Killa Beez - The Sting)
Explosive, baby, comin' at you
(Y'all mothafuckas know..
The next chamber's the mothafuckin' weather)
Look out for the Stingers, baby




I ain't trying to be no D-boy, I love music, I'm a b-boy
Are you the undercover or the decoy
I'm heavy with the D, Trouble T Roy
A pit with no muzzle about to bust your bubble like a keloid
Too much marijuana got me p-noid
I'm killing instrumentals with that All So Simple Can It Be, boy
Shout to Lil Cease, B.I.G., boy
And Funk Doctor Spock, I mean Redman that's not Leonard Nimoy
88 keys on the keyboard
I'm down to catch wreck, take them first three letters out of record
It's Meth, you heard it through the wire I could be more
Or washed up like Sonny Black's body on the seashore
That's a problem, I could be yours
A monster without the mad scientist and Igor
I've heard it before, a third of these boys
Got murder raps and never even murdered before


Keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
Keeping the streets locked
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
Keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
Run these streets out here don't need cops
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block


Codename Sensei, I live what my pen say
Game hall of fame, flow is MJ, Muy caliente
Je m'appelle Rebel, capisce, comprende?
Son I'm touching 'em up, trust I'm like
Justin Tuck how they ducking the rush
Tryna Break Bad, you catch a bad break
Like I own a bake shop how I stack cakes
Greatness was nothing, Deck the next Nike ad
Wifey bad and my life got 'em slightly mad
Cause I shine like chrome in July
Soldier I opened your eyes, notice the lies
DEA say I'm drugging 'em
I get you leaning hard, I get the fiends to nod, I mean they loving 'em
All hail your highness, terrific win
Put a so-called beast in his place, Pacific Rim


Keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
Keeping the streets locked
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
Keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
Run these streets out here don't need cops
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block


Foul ass police, crooked ass friends
I don't give a fuck yo, the drama never ends
I'm a project nigga, I don't care about the Benz
Plus I had a lot of chicks, you can have those bitches
But I murder your bloodclot if you touch my riches
Yeah crazy ass skipper, I be in the slums, nigga
Fuck where I come from I'm a quiet gangster nigga
First I get you comfortable, then I start shanking niggas
Park Hill code is don't violate the family
Brother to brother it's no snakes in the amnesty
I come through wilding on some Wu-Tang 'Can It Be'
Googly-eyed nigga, chop his face in the ministry
Never scared to do the time, fuck the penitentiary
Leave a bunch of dead niggas, don't forget to mention me
The angel of rap, the un-ordinary light
Already did what I was gonna do before you even got the mic


We left a large solar cloud distinguished by size
Interaction with the wise and civilized
The mind caused matter to fall into a center
A great deal of heat that'll radiate within ya
From out of this collision
The central cord became thick enough to trap its own light and bring vision
Each drop full of Hip Hop energy
Balanced on all sides such great symmetry
The bars unlocked the power of the stars
The mirror in the telescope pinpoint the Gods
From a distance, acting as a guiding coach
Analyze the board, universal approach
Retune the soul to a certain pitch
Changing the frequency frequently, hitting a certain switch
The love is paramount, the connect is brotherly
Respect for the intellect and broad discovery


Keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
Keeping the streets locked
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
Keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
Run these streets out here don't need cops
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block



(instrumental)




Yeah, yeah... we gon' get high to this
(The world's crazy, son yeah.. you know)
We gon' get high to this (just something about her)
My girl's a killa, my girl's a killa
(You know, her bag was always heavy, everytime I been around it)
We gon' get high to this (and diners, and restaurants, I don't know)
Yeah... yo...


Aiyo, I couldn't get enough from the way she smell
Was it Baby Phat, J.Lo, or straight Chanel
Her face belongs in a Luther video, Never Too Much
The way she smile, her face look pretty, though
Hands is soft, feet, no calluses
Her father owned six Palestine palaces
Laying out in New York, plush villas in Vegas
Greatest designer wear, son, she sport the latest
So I, pause the smooth talk, made her a drink
Blew her a kiss, as I sat down, she smiled and winked
Stood up, grabbed my hand, what up, slid ya boy to the bedroom
Popped the suitcase, I'm in the lead room
This check was loaded, equipped, with fifths
Porcelain handles with horse back kicks, whispered
"You know what, Ghost, I do hits" But niggas get fooled
By the sexyness, I'm a real gritty bitch


Killa Lipstick, my femme fatale, with the biscuits
A hit chick, now I'm number one on her hitlist
She killing the game, cuz she the business
Type of chick that love you to death, then leave no witness
Killa, I call you Killa cuz you slay me
Killa, you murda, mami? Ooh, you such a fucking lady
Killa, drive me half crazy, let's go half on this baby
Killa Lipstick, k-k-killa


Yeah, this white chick from L.A., she smelled like Downy
Had her best friend named Jade, from Rockland County
Double cokeheads who love cartoons, type chicks who eat pussy
Listen to Prince and play with they wombs
Flight attendant out of Delta Airline, get money girls
Travelled the world, only one did jail time
Jade, her father's a judge, same nigga in the O.J. case
When he tried on the glove, but uh, in this scenario, four A.M
The bars closed, now we at it again
Drunk nigga, come out I'm popping mad shit, he's past lit
Nancy Drew, drew out her purse, the blue steel ratchet
Didn't even say shit, she blasted, barrel smoking
Shot the Henny out his hand for laughing
These are my bitches, Nancy and Jade
Natural born killas be letting they guns blaze... god damn!




Look she tired of the same old basic, let's face it
This is how she wants to be laced, I'm raping it
Anywhere, I'm taking it, she loving how the gangsta flex
This is thug sex, Iking it, nasty talk
As she liking it, spanking it, she biting the sheets
She's a freak, my view from the embassy suites
Is off the beach shore, Dirty would've love you, mami
'You like it raw?' A tear drop, fucking you slow
I see your knees knock, your love is so sweet
If I switch beats, and hit you with angles, you might breathe
You know the Godbody make healthy wise seeds
You, plus a glass of weed, is all he need
You could travel so far, look, maybe book a flight to Mars
To escaping at, one forty two?
They take Jet Blue for two, into Long Beach
Rain lifted whipping the port, from when I touch
Look something nice up in the stash, hit a Dutch





{intro, some lady, whatEVA}

{Method babbles for a bit about Wu affiliates}


Shoes full of dirt, kickin sand on your works
Somethin gotta hurt, catch a case off a verse
Live in concert, kids comin out they shirts
I'm hyped now, jumpin in the crowd, feet first
Meant it when I said it, lungs bring the pain son
Without the anesthetic, make em look pathetic
Needin help from paramedic, Hot with the Nickel
Bust back take em witchu, survival of the fittest
And the world out to get us, I feel it in my bones
I can feel it in my testosterone when it's on
Stat' bring it back, hard rap for your pussycat
Cognac, off the meat rack, where the pussy at?
Johnny, got these niggas mad at they mommy
Jumpin on my hard salami, say what you like
In the heat of the night, I crash individuals
Splash on the mic airtight with the lyrical

Chorus:

Nigga run with it, have fun with it
Blow your gun with it, and be done with it
Welcome to the killin field, where Johnny Dangerous
Headbanger Boogie niggas, goin through changes


It all starts with the pad and pen, my special blend
Of herbs and spices on mic devices, murder men
Make em mices I recommend, somethin that's priceless
For you rap hooligans, claimin you nicest
Call it what you like kid.. you can even call
A psychic for all I care, still ain't got a prayer
Amonst the righteous, Blazini, cheat death like Houdini
Word to Bad Bird that fucked nerds in bikinis
Observer, lyrical flur's, you bein served
From the gizzard, pluckin yo' nerves with nouns and verbs
From the ghetto to the suburbs, I must be heard
Niggas get what niggas deserve
You can put that on my Clan logo, Wu-Tang group or solo
Bloody up my next promo
With the blood of the next bozo, clown-ass niggas be loco
Puffin on lye, cuckoo for cocoa

Chorus


Yo yo, shit be hot in the kettle pot
Twisted metal bust shot til the beef settle, forget me not
City nights get a nigga hype, scar of life
Send em back now we Poltergeist, ghost, tell em
Who the number the one rap host? Huh?
Verbal overdose leave em comatose, huh?
The nigga with the golden throat is out to get you, Hot Nickel
Bust back and take em witchu, eye for eye
Never lie, crossin my heart, hopin you die
Somebody pat the engineer down, I think he wired
I'm off the meat rack, quick to react, my niggas need that
They need gats, cockin heat back, be out like Freejack
The heat's on, you think one-eight, and Johnny's blamed
Who that nigga burn biscuits, and spit flame
Leave no witness, in the fast lane with shady bitches
That only want me for my riches, I know your steez
Terror Fabulous, caution, biohazardous degrees
From this ravenous, MC's be yappin
Meth be the co-captain, on Def Jam's that's close captioned
For hearin impaired, to get a share, now what's happenin
Money to share, that's why we here
And y'all actin, like we can't eat, like y'all eat
Now we scrappin, out in the street
I know your crew's hardheaded motherfuckers
And I'm just like you

Chorus

Welcome to the killin field, where Johnny Dangerous
Headbanger Boogie niggas, goin through changes

I been in the ghetto all my life
I swore to take that bitch for better or for worse, yaknowhatI'msayin?
That's for life nigga y'know? Til death do us part..




I'm bout to fuck this track get the KY jelly
I'm pluck you haters nerves like a game of skelly
Yeah I might screw Nelly in the back of the deli
And y'all say the Queen don't keep it gully
She want him home by one, he ain't showing tonight
I guess ol' girl ain't throwing it right
Down down baby on the first lady
Before he bust, I'm slidin off to Slim Shady
Dear Eminem, you just don't understand
I want to melt in your mouth and not in your hands!
Your accent make me horny, you got hits
So peep the remix: your bum is on my tits
Usher, you ain't got to call
Have you singing 'U Remind Me' to a blow up doll
I'm into sports, mostly basketball
I be like, "Ohh" when they take it to the hole
Picture me the coach of the New York Knicks
Getting head from Sprewell, choke on this!
Sixty-nine's the position I can't resist
I'm that blunt in Snoop's mouth, smoke on this
From Chris Webber to Vince Carter, who get in the best
Competing for the Queen like a dunking contest
Yo, J to A.I., when you in Bedstuy
Make sure you holla at the K.I


Knock 'em out the box, bitch, knock 'em out, bitch
Knock 'em out the box, bitch, knock 'em out, bitch
Knock 'em out the box, bitch, knock 'em out, bitch
Knock 'em out the box, bitch, knock 'em out, bitch
It's time I show 'em what a bitch is all about, bitch
A keep it movin', keep them bitches out my mouth, bitch
From the east, to the west and dirty south, bitch
Knock 'em out the box, bitch, knock 'em out, bitch


For a million dollars a head, I'll fuck all of Cash Money
Back that thang up like a Playboy bunny
Bling bling, every time Baby hit the booty, bling bling
And Lil' Wayne run up in the cootie, ching ching
Juve' and the rest of the crew, the same thing
Hahaha, I cracks myself up
I know I talk shit, but I can back myself up
Can't believe the words I'm spittin'
Zab, I'm from Brooklyn, that's a no brainer
Why the fuck you ain't call me to be ya personal trainer
I'm just fucking with you, don't get mad, and try to spazz
Or I'll have to call that nigga Kostya Tszyu on your ass
Tyson, Sugar Shane, you boxers turn me on
Hope your dick's like your money be... real long
Just 'cuz I'm a freak and talk dirty in my songs
This pussy ain't for free, now that's where you're wrong
I take Tank to the bank, before his career sank
For me to sex him, I need about 17 drinks
Like The Artist said, I'm a sexy muthafucka
Tryna make a Rush Hour 3 porno with Chris Tucker
What about Musiq Soulchild, man I'd rather suck Bilal
And have an orgy with the whole Where Brother Art Thou
Jagged Edge, 112, N'Sync, is on
Get my hands on Justin and Britney Spears is GONE



Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?
I smell it
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?
I smell it
Come on, come on
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?
Yo, finally The Rock has come back
Layin down the smack on your monkey crap candy coated ass
Enter the squared circle with the Great One
Most electrifying moves, don't change the station
Children and their children, they all chant
With the millions upon millions of Rock's fans
Get ready for the square dance, here's your chance
For a can of ass whooping, from the People's Champ
If you smell what The Rock's cooking
If you smell what The Rock's cooking
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?
If you smell what The Rock's cooking
If you smell what The Rock's cooking
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?
Jabroni, check yourself, you don't know me
Jabroni, go back to the gym, you're too bony
So you want a piece of The Rock? Make you crumble
In these Wrestlemanias, kid, we Royal Rumble
Telling us that Raw is War, what the hell you think we came for?
Just to play with these whips and chainsaws? And sharp glass
I'll shine them up real nice, turn them sideways
And shove them up your candy ass
If you smell what The Rock's cooking
If you smell what The Rock's cooking
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?
If you smell what The Rock's cooking
If you smell what The Rock's cooking
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?
Yo, yo, this is it y'all, Summer Slam, Summer Sam'd out
It's Thursday Night Smackdown, there's No Way Out
Now you got a problem, with the Brahma Bull
Time to throw Rock Bottom
Ain't no way to stop him
See the People's Eyebrow, ignite the crowd
Into a feeding frenzy, they want blood now
Chinlock and chair shots, suplexes, legdrops
Finish with the People's Elbow and sign it Rock
If you smell what The Rock's cooking
If you smell what The Rock's cooking
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?
If you smell what The Rock's cooking
If you smell what The Rock's cooking
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?

If you smell what The Rock's cooking
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?
If you smell what The Rock's cooking
If you smell what The Rock's cooking

Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?
Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?



Konichiwa bi*ches
Konichiwa bi*ches
What up, what up, these n****z suck?
They can't hold a fort, better hold that thought, B
If I can't get it off, see my attitude is MSG
F*** it, I'm salty, the game been loss me
Pay ya dues, it cost me, who acting like I'm past my prime
Hey Carlton Fisk, n****, pass the nine, who wanna cross me, now?
And put my body in the lost and found
You with the business, then bust off a round
It's like the passions of Christ, get crucified just for having that ice
And the audacity for having that life, while n****z starving and s***
The main reason they be robbing and s***
The same reason you've been targeted b****
(These n****z must of forgot)
The thin line between a hoe and a trick
Give 'em the clip between the four and the fifth
(Yea, motherf***er I'm high)
There I go again, blowing a spliff
When I exhale, it's like I'm blowing a kiss
(Konichiwa bi*ches)
N.Y.C., is all I see, O.D.B., n****, R.I.P
(Konichiwa bi*ches)
This Killa Beez on ya M.I.C., you want it all
Well, then y'all like me
(Konichiwa bi*ches)
Come on, come on, I think they playing my song
I came to blow them out the frame and I'm gone
(Konichiwa bi*ches)
M E T, to the H O D, why motherf***ers wanna hate on me?
(Konichiwa bi*ches)
For every rhyme, there's a hair on my chest
Scared of the Man, you should be scared of the Meth
Now every damn that I drop, is homicidal, that could dare to be done
There's no survival, now who care to be next?
(If you don't know me by now)
Know where the borough is, doing it for
The most thoroughest, you doing the most, pa
The French call it "forpa" when f***ing with son
The odds a hundred to none, too many flavors
Y'all ain't f***ing with one
It's getting deep, see the plot thicker
No place to be, if you b*****, n****
Outside the Clan, we always got RZA
I put it down, like I don't give a
One in the head, I bet he don't get up
We drinking malt liquor out of your Benz
Just to talk slicker then paint a scene that you can all picture
You going in? Well, let me walk with cha
It's Method Man, but for short Mr., Mef
(Konichiwa bi*ches)
N.Y.C., is all I see, O.D.B., n****, R.I.P

Here we are..
Bobby, I was just wondering, you know
About me and you, tonight
If we could go do a little Rhumba
Dance, you just think about it and let me know


Esta bueno, porque esta es La Rhumba
Ven bailar conmigo en esta Rhumba
Esta bueno, porque esta es La Rhumba
Ven bailar conmigo esta Rhumba


Rhumba? What's Rhumba?
I'm sayin' though, what?
I'm sayin'..

Yo, what up Butter Pec'? Girl, you got me shy to speak
You the same dime piece that I saw last week
On the dancefloor, yo, the way you glide
Make a club of thugs do the Electric Slide
Pretty in pink, come here, let me buy you a drink
Armaretta sour orders put us both in sync'
My name is Bobby and I don't usually dance that much
I play the wall, but girl, you got that magic touch
That lured me in like a fly into the spider's web
Not these everyday hoes sweatin' ghetto celebs
Power Rule, I heard you got the good Power-U
Let's slip to my crib for an hour or two




Hey, hey, hey..
Uh, uh, uh, uh..
Eh eh eh eh eh..

Hey Butter Pecan what's that lingo you speakin'?
It sound like, let's me and you slide for the weekend (True)
I got drinks and tasty treats to sink your teeth in
Your popi two-way beepin', let him know that you cheatin'
Runnin' 'round indecent exposed without no clothes
There it go (*plug*), Moby Dick and there she blows
You got me covered, girl, and it shows and I suppose
We can play doctor soon as I drop my Girbauds


I don't wanna dance baby girl, it's like my legs is on strike
Boogie that ass to the bar, snatch a Remi, no ice
I'm in the corner, we can vibe all night
Polite, I need a bag of that grass
To blast me out of sight like a satellite
Bigga what up? Yo, long time, good to see you
Look at shorty ass shakin' like the system in my vehicle
Clubbin', twenty deep, buggin', all types of funny freaks
Mouths wide shut, we let our love for the money speak




Yo
Open season, open fire, Beretta barbed wire
First platoon strike soon, scud-missile on the whistle
Up in the club with the pistol
This chick bumped into me like, "You big joint official?"
Indeed, so? Blow out your back, yo
She was like, "Yo, negro, negro"
Puffin' all that trash, you best to see so (so so)
So I introduced her nightcap, she was like, "I like that"
Later on tonight, you know, I gotta spit that
Flow and a half, blow at her back
I like it rough, and I hope she's rough back
She was like say her name
I was like, "Say mine back"
She was like, "Yo, daddy, daddy, daddy"
I love it like that, Beretta stay givin' it
Power-U so good, I just might have to jizz in it






I pulled off with Juanita in a two-seater
Just left the lover, shorty loved it, shit was off the meter
High speed down the block, she had the hammer by Peter
Flipped her tongue inside my ear, I was like shit, mama mia!
Bong, I threw on a smooth slow song
As I stuck my two fingers in between her thong
She was like, "Bobby, Bobby, Bobby"
"Tu headache, ah popa chulo, de hablo Bobby"


Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba (Daddy, Daddy, Daddy)
Ven baila conmigo en esta Rhumba (Daddy, Daddy, Daddy)
Esta bueno, por que esta es La Rhumba (Daddy, Daddy, Daddy)
Ven baila conmigo esta Rhumba (Daddy, Daddy, Daddy)


Yeah
Yo it's the God Joey Crack and Bobby Digi
It looks like these Wu-Tang niggas beat me to the trizzi
They got mami's all over the place
Makin' out with each other and givin' niggas face
I'm so excited I'm invited to your party
And I'm on the ferry right now with some blunts and Bacardi
Headin' to the Island, not P.R. but Shaolin
Where every nigga got a Wu-Tang medallion
I'm in Stapleton, it's Off the Wall
We puffin' L's in the staircase, the fourth floor
Shorties givin' me brains, she thought she had me
'Til I flipped her over and mad her scream, "Daddy!"




Hey, hey, hey..
Uh, uh, uh, uh..
Eh eh eh eh eh..

Hey Butter Pecan what's that lingo you speakin'?
It sound like, let's me and you slide for the weekend (True)
I got drinks and tasty treats to sink your teeth in
Your popi two-way beepin', let him know that you cheatin'
Runnin' 'round indecent exposed without no clothes
There it go (*plug*), Moby Dick and there she blows
You got me covered, girl, and it shows and I suppose
We can play doctor soon as I drop my jabows






My flow's remarkable
Doc walk like Caine from Kung Fu 'round the globe
Throw obstacles I'll hurdle them
Herb and whack MC's
Drum racks to the rims, to the caps
Yo Methical, and D, I'm ASAP
I'm crack of dawn chicken hunting at KFC
In '83 I was that scrub TLC talked about
Now I rock the house, chalk 'em out


Yeah, no doubt
Who got the biggest ass in the house?
Young miss, fillet-of-fish, salt water trout
Pretty young thing, got a tongue ring and dirty mouth
And she whispering them sweet nothings, I air it out
Baby you got me like Joanie had Chachi
Until she got high and went and fucked Potsie
Lady Godiva, from day one a dick rider
Liar, liar set your pussy on fire


I see you dancing right now
I don't need to tell you that you know how
Baby you do
I say you belong
And if you dream to be free
I can take you there, just follow me
Baby I won't
I won't steer you wrong
And it seems like to me
You want someone to treat you like their queen
Baby I do
So what'cha want?
Smack your ass, pull your hair
And I even kiss you way down there
You know I will
Think I won't?


That's the way we do it
Left and right
Keep it moving
Up and down
How we do it babe
Left and right
Uh keep it moving

So what'cha doing?

Here you caught in my world
Make you feel like a pearl
I'll rub your back and fulfill your needs
So why don't we just get undressed?
Fingertips touching and you're caress
That's what I want
Why don't you give it to me?
I will have you believe
There's no reason for you to leave
Stay right here (stay right here)
In my arms (in my arms)
Bring you fears stay secure
Here with me you can be sure
There's no faking
You turn me on


That's the way we do it
Left and right, oh

The sexy little things you do?
Oh, oh why don't you know
The sexy little things you do?

(Method Man)
Yo Doc be off the wall
With Keith and Mally G
Pulling a Harley D with a jar of grease
Come 1-5-1, straight indo, the spot
I fuck brown sugar behind the fiber glass window
Its Doc not guns don't sling weight
The only thing I sling is condoms for spring break
(Fuck 'em) How we do it?
(Leave 'em) How we do it?
(Get the money) The pussy
(The weed) Now do it!

(Redman)
Now take your coat off and stay a while
Now honey child if you're gon' be acting funny style
Then I don't need ya
It's Saturday, this night fever
Shit is popping, Cheeba, my mouth cotton
'Tis the season for draws dropping
And heavy breathing
You ain't skeezing
You dick teasing?
I'm leavin'
Acting rotten, I got no time for games
I'm no joke
Drop that ass when I'm finished
And watch it smoke
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)




I'm like go, team Eric', I was born with dopeness, just why you inherit
This is why I'm hot
Playboy, approach me wrong, this is why I shot
Ball, I get the game from my pop
Till everyone know my name the game don't stop
So I keep pumping the block, until I'm big as Rihanna and Mason's rock
While you love Sosa, I'm over here, loving this RG3 redskin that's on my sofa
Her ass alone, man, bigger than Oprah
Puerto Rican and Dominican, first name Rosa
Anyway, let me explain one time
Foowzy, we up in here making the movie
Check slate, it's a wrap, I'm a bigger nigga with figure
You figure how's that


But wait, let me explain this
But wait, let me explain this
Say I'm the best
Little ass nigga, say It with your chest
Hey, hey nigga look real quick
Hey, hey nigga look real quick
Hey, hey nigga look real quick
Hey, hey nigga look real quick


My money bigger than homie, you funny niggas is phony
Tony told me just show me so I gotta get mine
Let me just slip into the back of the wide
Open your eyes, let your window down
Now you on the passenger side
Get in, now you get it, better yet, with it
One come test me now, tell 'em the line get it
And bit them off a chip or the block or the wood
Little homie couldn't rock if he could
Click cocking and pull, hip hoping over the lot of the bull
And yes, I am paid in full, for shizzle minizay
That's all I'mma here say, all kisses cause I'm too mean
Too cold, too slick
Hey, hey nigga look quick
That nigga Snoop about to take your bitch with no hesitation or explanation




Like a room full of black, uproar heat
They see the flow back, getting all geek
It's like I'm Pete Charles, from Mall Street
They come and count money but talk cheap
But rappers walk quick and I'm all feet
Every line authentic, that's all me
My man son autistic, that's low key
That Wire I go and get it, I'm so G
That why with the fittest, so low key
Thats why killer critic with no fee
Then tell the judge I did it and go free
E, double E, my codeine, letst throw the book at em , what's your plea?
Guilty as charged, thats how it is when you're guilty or charged
Took a bunch of death artists and built me a squad
What's today's mad bill with the guard
We eat women in cars, lock the game down I'm givin it bars
What is life if you ain't living it large?
If you ain't living it large go get the price check it and get you a job
But wait






Grab a - hold to ya seats, my style bulldoze the streets
I talk dirty, puncture holes in my teeth
Cavity creep, I'm young hung over thirty
You with it move with it, now shut up I'm cool with it
Doc-tor, Jurassic IV rap-tor
Wrap your head in a gorge in trenches where rats crawl
It's mine (brrrr) that's yours, my gun is bisexual
It's hittin male or female when I'm lettin go
This is a code alert; my truck rim size da number
On Jordan shirt, 23's go to work
We stick to the streets my shell toe's Velcro
There I go - werewolf standing with scarecrows
Y'all niggas barely move me
'til you grow some balls like Miss Mann from Scary Movie
You banned from being mooly
I keep it black gutter, white gutter
Chinese gutter by these brothers
Here try these fuckers here


All my niggas let's do it

Looks a crooked eye motherfucker let's do it
Meth and Doc we got it locked let's do it
My block let's do it


I'm just too Kool and the Gang, it's a beautiful thang
Street pharmaceutical slang scoop loose in the brain
One mo' gen juice in my gin abusin yo chin
Be losing your religion again when the venom kicks in
Living with sin citizen X triple the threat
Mad dog wreck a animal house send in the vets
There it goes picking my nose fixing my clothes
At the same time keeping my flows different from yourz
Low key with the gold teeth half a O-Z on my person
Lookin at y'all niggas like y'all owe me
For certain I'm all that my fo'-mat
Wearin out ya do'-mat I'm hurtin commercialized acts
It's a wrap pull the curtain, Long John be long gone

Where all my dirty fingernail tell her right hell
I'm a lay patient to play Jason and when you nightmare
STOP pop cordureoys and we order toys
Medulla oblongata mean on them +Waterboys+
Gorilla man do whatever
I'm bound to make a fan do the same thing Stan did in a letter
I bounce with a bitch with a ounce on a trip
Take her girlfriend, nut in they mouth when they kiss
And I make em SCREAM - I go banana yo
With animal anecdotes with Hannibal hammer loads
You be ducking like the pope when he bow in
You get that for touchin pit throats when they chowin

I am hip-hop: look through the lens
My fitted cap got the gold sticker on the brim

Let's go
Baby come with me, go
Cause we fit when we (ride out)
You and me when we (ride out)
Baby, come


Look Baby roll with a rider, girl it's nothing I'll drive ya
Get in, fasten your buckle, leave them troubles behind ya
Leave them struggles, ain't trying to, knock your hustle, I'm trying
Get your hand on some kind of diamond or custom designer
You can jump in the , if you're hot with desire
Why not jump out the skillet, jump right into the fire
Cause you know how I get it, love some Louis attire
We don't talk it we live it, yep, 
This is all  to these groupies, want to scoop me, I like her
Kind of flookie that move me, want to do me, I pipe her
I ain't tripping or tricking, when I'm picking I'm choosing
Hit the stripper, if she stripping, I'm taking  from the Fugees
Love a woman that's winning, independently spending
Run the house like she living, like she live with the Simmons
If she like it I love it, girl if you dug it I dig it
Hey, in private or public, girl this is just the beginning

 (x2)
Let's go
Baby come with me, go
Cause we fit when we (ride out)
You and me when we (ride out)
Baby, come


Meine Squaw is' 'ne Ghetto-Gringa
Trgt nix, auer Stringchucks und paar Tattoos in schwarz
Bin ihr Shadow-Ninja, schleiche Nachts in die Suit
Tanz' halbnackt zu Jay-Z und puff' von mei'm Weed, sie
Ist verrckt nach mir, ich bin verrckt nach ihr
Weil sie, trotz Schicki Micki, dann im Bett zur Bitch mutiert
Leckt mit der Zunge ber's Spliffpapier
Bevor sie mir liebevoll den nchsten Stick serviert
Puppe, du bist Champions Leauge, du bist mein Starface
Meine Nummer eins, Lois Lane, ich bin dein Clark Kent
Und ich mach' alles klar, was geht fr dich
'N haufen Ketten, einfach nur, weil du mein Mdchen bist
Genetikk-Clique, Sikk da Kid is' zu dope, Divas werden zu Ho's
Sie fressen mir aus der Hand wie Sikks Kater auf YouTube
Vaffanculo, Karuzo, ich hab jetzt den Wu-Flow

 (x2)
Let's go
Baby come with me, go
Cause we fit when we (ride out)
You and me when we (ride out)
Baby, come




Oohh, uh-oh, it's time, Meth Man, G-Wine, aiy-aiy-aiy-aiy
Aiyo, Meth this shit sick boy, haha, (it's beautiful) yeah
What's up (aww man, it's getting scary for y'all niggas now) what's good


There go the apple of my eye, my black butterfly
Don't try to pass me by, like you do them other guys
You do with brother's lies, about they baby mothers & they wives
And how you need they ass to survive
I ain't a bit suprised, and I ain't try'nna give you bad vibes
You probably had a bumpy last ride witch ex
Was he stalking, calling making threats where you rest
Until you got that order of protect
Girl, I'm far from a threat, boo, now hold for a sec
Relax with the Meth, take a load off your breast
If you had a choice, baby, who would you choose
Them dudes who look like they got sugar in they shoes
Girl, that's how you lose
Before you play the game, know the rules
Cuz still ain't nothing changed but the jewels
You still paying dues, when we should be laying on the cruise
Some icecubes, playing with ya boobs, knawmean


Let's ride, we get it everyday, it's doesn't fail
And I always wanna know how you feel
Cuz you're everything, I'm always there for you
Yes, I'll be there, so let's ride
Let's ride, don't trip, got your back, I'm your man
I keep it G, like they do it in the hood, and
You give me everything, and always be right there
And if you real, then let's ride


Hey, pretty ma, you look sweat, I mean
You the type of treat, I've been dying to eat
I see them other dudes try'nna speak, flossin' them jeeps
They wanna whistle & beep when you crossin' the street
Have mercy, to these big hands and big feet
Use me once and use me again like fish grease
Body perfect, primadonna, oh my god, mommy, work it
Make a nigga wanna get a job
I love chicks to hate staring, hate man sharing
Hate it when a bum bitch is wearing what she wearing
Huge attitude like the size of her badunk
Double XL, she the "Eye Candy of the Month"
Johnny, but ladies call me Big John Studd
Is it my big club or my big long hugs
Go figure, if you got an itch, I'm ya nigga
To scratch it, and bring the hook back while I'm at it, now pass it




Let's ride, I start up on your right
Peace and then we'll fight
I'm starting to fall for love
Yes, I will, yes, I will
Let's ride, don't need to think twice
I, want you at your time
Let's ride, let's roll, all night, oh lord
Full night, oooh tell me something




Yeah, this is Ginuwine, uh
Method Man, yeah, I like that



 + (Raekwon)
(Yeah, yeah) Aiyo, how much more for a fifth of Vodka? (Peace beloved)
(Six bottles of Henny, six bottles of Henn) Word, word, let me get that
Herb, yeah, yeah.. (bring that bucket here)
Yeah (get some ice, man, two more bottles of Cru', man, word up)


I've gone through life pretending
That time will change the ending


Peace to the God (peace God) pour out a little liquor
Shame On A Nigga, I heard the reaper done came to get ya
So I done copped a fifth of, Vodka, and in your honor
I've grown this fetish for loose ladies and baby mommas
Some say it's bad karma, what you do, man, it come back on ya
Music got us up off them crack corners
Now I'mma swallow this whole bottle for Ol' Dirty
Damn, it hurts me, I hate it when brothers go early




Word to my son, he gon' remember you, rubbing on a statue
In his lab, that resemble you, and what it meant to Wu
Us forming like a family, you just blew
You was the chess piece on the board, that made us look true
Watching your pen swish, you love frying kingfish
You the pearl in the ocean, I'm up on the land, pissed
Now you moving more prestigious, me, hitting this reefer
I know it's real, guess I slept with the Black Jesus




I became weak when I heard, that his body expired
It was hard for me to believe my brother retired
Suddenly the clock stopped and the room started spinning
How can he walk off the field during the first inning?
I cried like a baby on the way to his place of death
Hate not being there, the minutes before he left
Now I'm in the booth, ten feet from where he lay dead
I think about him on this song and what he might've said




When I first heard the word, I needed air to clear my head
I know you didn't say what I thought you said, my brother's dead
You crazy, another Dirty prank to get the family cranked
Ya'll niggas shouldn't play like that, I know how you feel
Lord, but it's real, and I still can't believe
And my heart still grieves the loss, there's no pretending
Ason Unique, loved wine and fine women
We singing on tour, "ooh baby, we like it raw"




Can't pretend...
Some day it gotta come to an end
But I'mma keep you right here dog, real close to my heart
Yeah...


I popped a bottle on your born day, God
Tried hard not to cry, I still can't hide the scar
And I still ask, why to God, analyzing your form
As I stood there beside your mom
And I share the blame, cuz you was calling for help, kid
Should've, would've, could've, had the time, I was selfish
I carry on your struggle, each day it really hurts me
I really miss you Russell, hope you forgive me Dirty




Yo, these walls I wanna crash, and put my fists through
Shout out to Dirty, let the whole world miss you
Reach out and kiss you in your coffin, my heart races
I dropped tears and watch my nigga fall from greatness
It's all wasted, flushed down the drain and
Soon as the news hit me, I bust out with pain and
Rivers I cried, my brother just died
I'mma see you, my nigga, on the other side




Ah, man, how do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones that have to die
It's hard to live without you, God, I shouldn't have doubted you
When you said that The Passion of Christ was all about you
From the God Mobile, to Linden Plaza, to Brownsville
Florida to Ohio, to Putnam, to Park Hill
You interrupt the Grammy's said "Wu for the kids"
Took four or five shots when they rushed in the crib
Trey-five-seven cracked ya ribs, cops shot ya whip
You've been chased by the pigs, sold the four year bid
Crashed cars, still came out without a scar
They tried to keep ya free spirit trapped in a jar
So you'll keep ya mouth shut, and not tell the world
Who's who and what's what, and probably go nuts
How we treat them hoes? Dirt, how we treat them hoes?
We fuck 'em in the butt, Dirt




But those mistakes behind me
Cast shadows to remind me

*gong bangs*
*Sifu Shi Yin Ming reciting the Heart Sutra*




Hey, you, get off my cloud
You don't know me, and you don't know my style
Gettin' lifted, never comin' down
Gettin' lifted


Gettin' dumb on the drum rum-pum-pum-pum-pum
Better run, when I come, what a bomb bomb
Sippin' on coke and rum, gettin' so drunk
Everyone wonderin' where she come from?
Got gold on my necklace, gold on my wrists
Girls gettin' mad cause their boys want a kiss
Fast with the cash, I just throw it in the bag
Everything I wanna have (well I think you get the gist)


Upside downside, inside outside
Hittin' you from every angle, there's no doubt
Poetry in motion, coast to coast and
Rub it in your skin like lotion


I got myself a 40
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted
Yes, I'm about to go get lifted
I got myself a 40
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go get lifted
Yes, I'm about to go get lifted


H-U-F-F, huff and I puff
Blow like snow when the cold wind's blowin'
Zoom, I hit the mic like boom
Wrote a song about it, like to hear it? Here it goes
Style will hit you, wham, then goddamn
You'll be like, "Oh shit, that's the jam!"
Turn it up, now hear me get buck wi-wi-wild (while)
I'm about to blow, light me up


Upside downside, inside outside
Hittin' you from every angle there's no doubt

Yes I'm about to go get lifted
I got myself a 40

Hey love, hey love
Hey love, whoo, hmm-hmm-hmm
Yo hey love you're the girl that I adore
Every time I go on tour
I want you more and more
Ma I am yours, mi amor
My ghetto Zsa Zsa Gabor
Don't be snitching to the law
Or ever give up my draws
You're Fly Robin Fly
That apple of my eye
Crooked eye this is what it sounds like when thugs cry
Baby you're like the silent kind
That can tell a good joke, my funny valentine
Roll an L and still smoke it at the same time
Blow your spine I ain't got to ask whose - is this
You know it's mine FOREVER
Stop the regrets and baby let's get it together
Taking these vows for worst or better
And if so I got you
Holding you down like your pops do
You were the pants I'll were the crown
Ain't nobody gon' love you this way
And ain't nobody gon' f- like Jolly J


I had enough of love
Was tired of the lying and the game
I told myself that men were all the same
Then suddenly my world began to change
Cause that's when I found you

1 - Ain't nobody
Loving me like you do baby
Can't nobody
Make me feel the way I'm feeling
Ain't nobody
Loving me like you do baby
No one for me like you baby

Now I can smile again baby
Cause lonely days are gone since you are here
Erase the pain and changed the way I feel
Now I believe that love can be for real
I pray that you never leave

Repeat 1

Don't mean to brag
But it's the things you do
Don't mean to talk
But it's the way you love me
Feels like its heaven when I'm here with you
The way you love me makes me happy


Yo now ain't no woman like the one I got
She floss hot to trot keep my manhood rock
Real deal when she give me something I can feel
And still jumpin' out the bed to cook a meal
For her boo, we share like Sonny and Cher
I got you babe and I'll be there
You ain't got to have a care in the world
The scenario when boy meets girl
I'll give you dough to fix your curl
The birds and the bees, the flowers and the trees
Me and you bucking naked all out the sheets
All I wanna do is make ya happy
Just ask me
I'll give you the world if I can fit it through the door
I'm like the love boat ALL ABOARD
Docking in your seashore I give it to you raw like
Voule'vo, cuse, aver ma
Excusame, que't que't menage'tois

Repeat 1 till end



 Aowww!

 I'm 'bout to light my medication!
 Hey yo Doc

 Let's do this shit
 Okay then - light one up for ya boy out there
 Yo, let's go


I like to fly the friendly skies until the sky fall
I got them frequent flier miles, I hit the Sky Mall
I'm on that red eye flight, you see the redness in my eyeballs
Homey ain't no question that I balls
I'm fresh as Pine-Sol, what you smellin is trees
Me and my bredderns inhalin watermelon and cheese
I clear my head like Magellan while he's sailin the seven, seas
'til armageddeon just waitin 'til I'm a legend
Please! I am legend, a veteran in my profession
No guessin it's Meth in this session, you smell this herbal essence
Ain't nothin like a first impression
Sky's the limit, and sometimes I'm so fly, I need a flight extension


Yo I know I smell good, when I walk by
I catch sky miles, cause I look high
And plus I look fly baby take a Polaroid
And when you done with that light one wit'cha boy


Yessir, A-YO
I've been in every hood around the world it never fail
Soon as they smell that aroma they say light the L
Yeah, they see me flow, Half Baked like Chappelle
I guess I swim AND smoke like Michael Phelps
Yeah, type the e-mail, tell 'em I got the bud
Females, I got 'em locked, like Casanova Rud
Lookin at my Roley I got time like the Culture Club
And since we off the hook, MMM, I'mma roll it up~!
Girl you know whassup, Friday we gon' get it in
I'm gonna tell you shut up, you'll say "Say it again!"
Now light one wit'cha boy to let you know I play to win
And tell them other emcees they life paper thin




Pass me a cigar I'll bust it open then I'll dump it out
Dig into my bag of tricks and pull a lil' somethin out (hold up)
That medical marijuana that's pharmaceutical
When I break it down that shit be stickin to my cuticles
The banana kush that's perfect for a gorilla
I twist that motherfucker up and fire up the killer
I put a lighter to the ass end and start smokin
Then pass it over to Reggie Noble and now he tokin
And puff puff pass nigga, don't be like the last nigga (naw)
Gave him a blunt and all he gave me back was ash nigga (naw)
Just tryin to smoke somethin (somethin) then hit the crunk spot (spot)
And shut that motherfucker down with the Funk Doc!

 - 2X


God damn Red~!




Let all the live niggas in
Kick all the bitch-ass niggas out
We came to rock and shock the house
Turn it out and out and out


Ayo, the words can get intricate, vocabs in my temple
But Ima do this swift and simple, instrumentals is what Im into
For the money its essential, and Ive got to have it
A verb addict, fanatical author with the verbals
We hurt whoever try to defy these guys
They fry in a skillet, so all that shit you say come on kid kill it
You yapping, not selling that crap and irking me needing a back slapping
You wouldn't know Crunch time if you was the Captain
Guess what?
Its here, and yeah we the core, the center
Its time to get live once more, we back on this agenda
And for yall hopeful niggas, tryin to be contenders
Its a storm
And we come down like goose coats in the winter




Ain't no slackin' in my action, I put my back in
Beatin' tracks in, official now cold smash and jaw tappin'
(Yo, what happened)
Nothin', just niggas busting caps when I was rappin'
Cause niggas be packing pretty brand new pistols just for fashion
Cause a fraction be acting, fronting, making Jacksons off of satin
But there better be no procrastin with the axe when you're blastin'
Cause when you're maxin and relaxin, that's when they start attacking' (so)
Get the gats, forget the backs and like there's no compassion
Keep your heat cause nowadays these streets is cold as the Alaskan
Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Manhattan, Staten steady stacking




Give me the shotty, let me liven up the party
I like to start trouble, cause Im a little rowdy
And we just three emcees that like to fight
Even when we start the shit we always end it right
So for all of y'all fronting is bad for your health
Cause in the nine-fever Armee's going for self
Kids is cruel for a cause and these fucked up conditions that we all hate
But fuck it if this our fate
Just listen up to what I say, cause niggas get shot daily, every day
Even my man got killed now his familys mourning
But from all the dirt he did, I know that hell is calling
Went to his wake and shit got held up
By niggas with masks on they face, I couldnt escape, I was stuck
They said "everybody in here up against the wall
That dead nigga owed me money so Im collecting from y'all"
The people gave no struggle, five minutes went fast
When  I said I aint giving y'all niggas shit, Ima just have to get blasted
Representing with my life, a full fledged thief
And Im the truth; thats why we always have beef



And we do it like this, and we do it like that
Rules and regulations, so watch ya back, and pack a gat
Never fall asleep, keep ya heat in the streets
Cuz goin out, iz what it's all about

ONYX!!! LIVE!!!
ONYX!!! LIVE!!!
ONYX!!! LIVE!!!




Yo (yeah), check it out, son, check it out, son
Yo (Wu, can I get a soo?), live in the place to be
You got the capital G, Z to the A, MC
Givin' a mad shout out to the Ranch Crew, from the old school
And we gonna take y'all back, know what I'm sayin'?
Lyrical sorcerors right here, the fathers, the cream of the crop, son
(Yo, check it)


Well, if you livin' in the world today
You be hearin' the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front, we don't have 'em
So we blast 'em, alright, well, ok
Well, if you like the way it sounds, then clap, man
And if the women love it too, well, then raise your hands
But only raise your hands if you're sure
Punk niggas shatter like a glass jaw, break it


My rhyme gross weight vehicle combination
Was too heavy for the Chevy's, is chased out the station
Double-edged was the guillotine that beheaded it
Gassed up, fuckin' with some regular unleaded shit
Heads roll on hillsides behind ropes that
Bind-in, X marks the spot on the scope
Heavily armed, military is necessary, it's a gamble
MCs bet they best at every
Powerful parable ditties might harm
If tampered with, set off and strike like pipe bombs
Flashbacks to the "Duel of the Iron Mic"
Look out for these fatal flying spikes, of massive
Sleep-holds, put strangle on commercial angle
Microphone cords tangled from being Star Spangled
Now, who could ever say they heard of this?
My motherfuckin' style is mad murderous


Well, if you like the way it sound then clap man
And if the women love it too well then raise your hands
But only raise your hands if you're sure
Punk niggas shatter like a glass jaw, break it

Well, if you livin' in the world today
You be hearin' the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front we don't handle 'em
So we blast 'em, alright, well okay



Well, what you know about MCin'?
Yo, I know a lot
Well, can you demonstrate somethin', nigga?
Huh, I'd rather not
I'm talkin 'bout stacks, cousin
Nigga, that's what I got
Cash Rules the world
Well, Cash Rules the spot


My preliminary attack keep cemeteries packed
Of niggas who think it ain't like that
MCs are gunned down like being run down with mad trucks
Then, God struck, religious niggas call it "bad luck"
Rap celeb, you got caught up in the web
Now, bees are stingin', yo, that niggas em-singin'
I'm just swingin' swords strictly based on keyboards
Unbalanced like elephants and ants on see-saws
I throw raps that attack like the Japs on Pearl Harbor
MCs be out like bank robbers
Fleeing the scene, to be a sole survivor
DJ, the getaway driver
Tried to dip, but he dive, I socialize on vocal vibes
On tracks stabbed up with razor-sharp knives
Criminal subliminal minded rappers find it
Hard to define it, when narrow is the gate
For fat tapes and, then, played out and out of date
Then I construct my thoughts on site to renovate
And from that point, the God made a statement
Draftin' tracements, replacements in basements
Materials in sheet-rock, to sound proof the beatbox
And microscopic optics received through the boxes
Obnoxious topic, major labels, flavor tropical
Punchlines, that's unstoppable
Ring like shots from Glocks that attract cops
Around the clubs and try to shut down the hip-hop
But we only increase if everything is peace
Father You See King the police


Well, if you livin' in the world today
You be hearin' the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front, we don't have 'em
So we blast 'em, alright, well, ok
Well, if you like the way it sounds, then clap, man
And if the women love it too, well, then raise your hands
But only raise your hands if you're sure
Punk niggas shatter like a glass jaw, break it

Well, if you livin' in the world today
You be hearin' the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front, we don't have 'em
So we blast 'em, alright, well, ok

The Wu-Tang say
We don't handle 'em, alright, well okay
The world today, the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front we don't handle 'em
So we blast 'em, alright, well okay




Get it!
Haha, Funk Doc in the building, bitch
Ya'll already know the business, nigga, haha


Yo, let's get it, yeah, I'm with it
Streets on fire, I'm frying my dinner
Quick like Sugar Ray Leonard, one love
Any boy get served like tennis
Menace, you call a rap bulldog
Me and my pen form into Voltron
Cold, my heart built with a snowball
And I fuck old women like Zohan
Roll on like Michem, Barry Bonds this bitch
When the beat start pitching
I'm broke, my ATM ain't kicking
But what I drive, I build expensive
Look at me, nigga, I got it
In pocket, ask Houston how I 'rock-it'
If I go hungry, you getting robbed
By me, Biggie Smalls and The Delfonics


Yo, man, yeah, yeah, take it back to Rae shit
Straight off the muthafucking concrete, nigga
You know how I go, word up, let's go
{Three minutes left...}


Before all the cussing and the gunfights
Don't wanna run Nikes, yeah, scramble when it sunlight
G's in my pocket of juice, blue goose
I'm a goon under the moon, glow on the boosters
Yeah, deadily my sons regret me
Windpipe writing, the mic fighting, respect me
I'm from where it get down, machete your mother
Snatch your brother, scrap you down
You know the deal, when we do this, chill
Catch me in Brazil, ratchet on, little glass of Tequil'
I sware to the real, my real, if I don't win
Then I won't spend, I'm grabbing bill
That's the hammer, I'mma do this, nana
Niggas who hunt, snatch 'em up, bite the clip, the banana
And this is for them good niggas, blow that L
And that blow that well, and watch the book, niggas


Yeah, watch them jooks, niggas, you know what it be, man
Word up, niggas staying alive (Gotta kill these voices in my head)
{Two minutes left} Bunch of fucking roaches, man


Jeter, married to the game without a pre-nub
And she don't act up, if I don't eat her
Damn, now that's what I call a diva
You sick, man? I'm what you call a fever
And I don't put no snow up in my cheeba
Pack a little heater, the game get colder in the freezer
Hit your little corner with the sweeper
Dance with the reaper, sharper than a fuck
Plus I'm laying in the cut like a half-moon Caeser
What you getting is the truth
My bird eye visions spot the pigeon in the coup
Same way I live it, how I spit it in the booth
Next to RZA, ain't no nigga bigger than the group
Stat, fuck that, we come strapped
Bust gats, drug raps, and pump cracks
What you trying do nigga, we done done that
I'm off the gunrack, nigga put ya gun back


Yeah, you slow your blow, boy
You gon' lay where you lie, nigga
(Get rid of the crack, and flush that dust
Hurry, where the L, move, come on, freeze, freeze)
{One minute left}


Aiyo, I woke up in handcuffs, heard the police wanted me dead
Big bullets and splashing all over
Kingpin's still moving that weight
And his main goon burned up a discotech
He's a hazard, classic, nigga, we got a flick of him
He jacked Nate, while he took the picture
And we tapped his crib, bugs all in the jacuzzi
Under the seeds bed, we found an uzi
Trully, and we know about his bitch in Charlotte
Pulled her over, State Troopers found two revolvers
And she told us them handguns "That's my fathers
And I'm licensed to carry those shits regardless
Ya'll just played my man, caught her with a million dollars
Worth of fireworks, coming back from Japan
It's nothing, ya'll police be fronting
And stop looking at my pussy, like ya'll want to suck it, I'm out
On ya'll pussies, catch me next time, bye bye"


Alright, fellas stand back and watch the closing doors
Lock 'em up! Let's go, lights out




Check Mic
The Superman love a girl, thats my handle
Thats why my hand on the handle of the Lambo
The man oh, save the soup for Campbell
I got girls goin Rambo in the land oh
With High heels, sandals, getting they freak on
Four girls eight feet deep in the Nissan
One black, two vanilla, one is pecan
The bomb, so I catch them all like Keshawn
The beats on so I throw on the headphones
With the mic keep a close eye on the redbone
I beat it up till they throw on the next song
When I die put Hes fly on the headstone
Get stepped on when you walk in my world
You pay tolls I fly over the Triborough
Hustler, Cadillac on my grill
Getting it, since J Lo is a fly girl




Who you know get higher than me
Look, Superman couldnt get flier than me
Im bout to get it started up like I powered the V
Im so fly when I was young they kept me tied to a tree
See im all that and some, cool and handsome
Ladies on my game run smooth as a Phantom
Thats why they can't stand him, still they chance him
Cuz if they really worth it they know ima romance them
But if they not, ima one night stand them
As soon as its over I tell em give my man some
You know Super Fly, Im his grandson
Pimp game vicious with the strength of Sams son
Where im goin you can't come, WHY? Its too far
A place where them niggas are flier than used cars
Catch me im at the juice bar, chillin with two broads
Somewhere in Amsterdam like im Harold and Kumar




You know im F-L-Y till I die girl, you know im fly
Look in my eyes and you know im high
Still loving even though I lie
And im a little too fly to stay grounded even though I try
All these haters wanna clip my wings
Gold diggers wanna get my cream
My money dirty howd it get so clean?
Im a dino when I dip my thing
I Tell the concierge to get my things
Big Meth always VIP
Stay fresh till I D-I-E
I be rollin it up, so when I puff
You with B-I-G
Ya money young gotta see ID
Why pay, I can fly for free
There ain't no I in We
And there ain't no limit but the sky for me
Be yaself, you ain't lying to me
Cuz there is a difference between what you are and what you tryin to be






I can't believe it
Could this be love, ya'll?
Could it be love, could it be love
At first sight?


Come on, let's go, I see you Mary
I like this right here, you ready?
Queen of hip hop and soul
Bad boy, Mary J. Blige, yeah, back together again, let's go


Lookin' at you from a distance
Gettin' all of my attention
Could this be love at first sight, baby
You walked away and I missed you
Visions of wanting to kiss you
How could this be if I don't really know you?
Ohh baby, baby


Could it be love at first sight?
And I never knew that I, could fall in love on the very first night
Could this be love?


You had on the latest fashion
It was a bigger distraction
It drew me closer and closer to you, yeah, baby
I never saw anything like this
But you I just could not resist
I swallowed my pride and stepped through your side
Or could it be - be




I wanna know if you could call me up (could you call me up sometime? please)
And maybe somebody we just might hook up, could this love at first sight?


Once again, it's that other M&M now
How many women feelin' him?
Somebody call the coroner, quick, Mary is killin 'em
Tell 'em what's the 411 and who came runnin'
When Clef dialed 911 from shots comin'
This somethin' for the radio, guest starring M.C
Johnny Blazin' the hip hop and R&B
What, ya'll thought ya wasn't gon' see me
You can't spell Mary J. Blige without a J.B
Well back to the matter, and it's sex on the platter
She only wanna be happy and I ain't mad at her
You go momma, nowadays, I'm more calmer
And if you take a look at my life, no more drama
Now you know, you searchin' for a Wu-Tang pro
You find me, just bout everywhere the poontang go
Now you know, feel me like your favorite love song
Cuz my computer love is the thetruth.com






Mami in a damn Range, do your damn thing
And don't be mad at me, because your man's lame
My boys call me Stumik, cuz it's my damn name
Now let's get it poppin', just like champagne
And it's a damn shame, cuz you deserve better
I'm a baller, I can show you how to burn cheddar
Or we can walk, hand to hand, with shoulders
Cuz my flow'll get you open like a can of soda
If we was snakes, I'm the man with the cobra
So why don't you get rid of that lizard, and come lamp with a soldier
Cuz I'm your first pick, and your dude is worthless
And if you don't understand, then boo, it's like this, listen


If love don't cost a thing, why is she chasing my paper, chasing my paper
I got a feeling in my heart that tells me something ain't right, something ain't right
Baby you could do what you do, you ain't got to do me no favors, do me no favors
I could of been the one that made that change in your life, change in your life


It seem like yo, everytime I turn around, you got your hand out
The only word I hear is 'money' out your damn mouth
It's all love, then why it seem like
When you see money, I got this green light
But when the bread's gone, Paulie's in a red zone
Got to get my badge patched up and go the hell home
You need a manicure, you need a pedicure
You need to chop and cop something out of every store
And when you out of cash, you want to spend mine
But I ain't strippin', bitch, I'm dippin' on you this time
I'm a breeze, don't holla, chill
Because I'll rather be single like a dollar bill




Look, I'm razor sharp, ain't no cut in my throat
If you smell me, you see I'm dope, ain't no cuttin' my coke
I'm still, rough with the quotes, still, puffin' my smoke
While these critics still on they knees and still suckin' off GOAT's
My shit's grimey, not accustomed to soap, might even seel a customer soul
Or throw these shells thump in his coat
Spend my budget up, like 'fuck it, I'm broke'
You like them dudes on VH1, you lose trying fuck with New York
Look, this what the game bout, I'm from where niggas
Don't come around with the chains, I hangs out
With them ghetto women that bang out, do hair sell
Dope and babysit out the same house, you caved out
I do my thang, it's Wu-Tang, still in the game
My niggas still in the bathroom, stealing your chains
Look, it's M-E-F and Ice H20
Combination to the safe, it ain't safe no more, bitch




Yo, they say 'love don't cost a thing' like J. Lo
But that change when they asking for things and I say no
I make dough, so you know I play with my bread
I trick chicks to lick dick, for trying to braid my head
I ain't rich but I'm making my spreads, so bitch dig this
Consider it a privalege to lay in my bed
I'm a don, I don't pay 'em for head
I don't even pay attention they mention I can pay for the rent
All they get is violated instead, I be making them beg
Get on your knees, say please, before I say to this dead
I'm a G, I see cake on the reg
And they don't ever a see a slice, just a pipe that I'm laying instead





 Selecta come!!!!!

Play this song on your fuckin radio, play this song on your fuckin radio




We push weight with ice cubes in a cup
(America's) most (wanted), police pin it up
(Alize an Henny), thug passion brother what
Potent it get a girl pregnant off a finger aaaaahhhhh
Doc the code name, merging both lanes off the lot
(We can die) Yeah I'm taking full blame
I'm hard headed, cap fitted for ryhmes
I touch up your shape up when Doc spit on the iron
What it is my brother?
(Trying to live my brother)
How you live my brother?
(Real civilized brother)
I'm non-fragile when I walk the streets
I rock with Force MDs not a force...


Chin check is in effect, catch wreck
(Put him in a yoke, snap his neck)
Mr. M-E-F
(The bigheads is at it again)
Bone shattering, beat battering men
Scattering like roaches
Bless 'em with the over dosage of black flag
(Say goodbye you got no class)
Ship sinking fast
(Bon voyage)
See you at the bottom when I spot um
Grab him by the throat and say aaahuuumm I got 'em


What's up my brother?
What's up my brother?
What's up my sis?
What's up now sis?
I got what you need
You got what I need?
Got the mad mad crew up in the house
(Repeat x2)


Yo dog it's my fault, Doc shock with volts
Until deaf mutes can talk, cripple kids can walk
My style will show guns what it is to spark
It'll clear the park twenty miles apart
Doc is like bad weather reports by Al Rourke
If you're not from the tri-boro, story settled
I pack gaudy metal for those who act fool
Big fish in the water and we hard to harpoon
I'm like open wounds pour the iodide in
Messing with us is like Saving Private Ryan
You acting out of line now you lying, dying
Wash my evil hands in the fire hydrant
Yeah girl, my kahuna's hooked up in the harness
Flying through hard knock life and still touring
My ropes pop in Chicago I hit the floor then
Got up and woke up with a bird in the morning


Aiyyo we mo' phat than down south trash, and you know that
With format to blow the welcome of your door mat
Toes tap now to hellafied sound
Wipe your town off the road map, baby mess around
I propose that you go and get your crew
And get the bozack too, Def squad Wu
Are just slaves to the rhythm
Clinton is the Pres I still voted for Shirley Chisholm
Poisonous venom, my philosophy get busy-ism
The most beautiful, I get up in 'em
Menace as usual, play your corner
Slinging the ghetto pharmaceuticals, the Methadonna
OD on Flinstone chewables and mary mary mary
So dont ever say I didn't warn ya
And I dont wanna be the one to sik the dogs on ya
I'm still ghetto, I rhyme ghetto, my peoples ghetto
Pants are saggy, teeth yellow
Now thats what I call grimy, a million crazy kids behind me
Killa Hills 10304 is where you'll find me
If you're looking baby I'm right here
(C'mon down!)






And nothing's new but the shoes
What it do, what it do
And nothing's new but the shoes
What it do, what it do


Cash rules everything around me (cake, cake)
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all


Knowledge of the Kingdom for a minute, but I'm so gone
The world wrapped around my throat saying hold on
And I can't breathe, this pain won't leave
Trying get it together on my own the slow 
Thoughts so calm
Mastermind of consciousness
Master with a plan or disaster is the consequence
The Benz polished short sight and not confidence
With the faith of a mustard tree, we move continents
Made marvellous, results of a God who thought of us
The same God became a martyr to harbour us
Cold hands in this blood stained promise
The only Man who kept a hundred percent when He promised us
Peace
And a release from the harmfulness
Imagine that heaven only charmed and had come to us
Maybe it's the only thing that belongs to us
Maybe we haven't belonged long enough
Maybe we let sin become a part of us
Maybe we need life water just to wash us up
Not a doubt in my mind that water isn't strong enough
I tried
This evil in my soul is too hard to scrub


Cash rules everything around me (cake, cake)
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all


I wouldn't sell my soul for it all
The cash, the gold, the Rolex, the sex
The lust, the pleasure, the million dollar check
I wouldn't sell my soul for it all
Knowledge of the Kingdom but I'm stuck
So hard to move  off my hands I was trying to harm this fool
If you thought I'm upset I bond to this carnival
And alarm don't worry my struggles aren't hard to you
Why do I question God's love like it's so hard to prove
Know you only exist cause God thought of you
Now figure that, it's hard to do
Go and try can I promise you it's hard to do
Every mistake that we make it's still starting to
And I'm the one that did it, it's almost like I saw Tucson bleeding ruse
No justice that a song could do
But the moment He looked at me I saw the truth
Some of us just sell amount to put on some jewels
Pharmaceutical dreams of being rich
No one can lose, small pursue
Occupied mind made for larger moves
I'm tryna live, I'mma follow ones for two


Cash rules everything around me (cake, cake)
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all (cake, cake)


These snakes always seem to be close to me
It seems that I must treat the ones that mean the most to me
And when this Egyptian touches my chest I'm feeling so outta breath
My conscience won't let me rest
I'm exhausted
Me and Louis V., taking jewellery,  move outta and we zoning from the purest keys
Technically a branch, call me palm trees
Simple rose ain't white linen it's south beach
Red carpet up but I keep a hood reach
Hood bleeding so I cleaned it with the good bleach
And every industry rapper we yell preach
They only spit truth right, *beep* please
Man we talk about the cake
Sierra mist with the jelly on the bass
Got a sweet tooth stir it up and then bake
Give you type two, cold body with the shakes
I ain't frontin' B
And you can never have enough of it
 or rich, equatorial or obelisk, got a certain lust for this
Talking Grandino
Grant got me blessing, Franklin off the ego
Room so free-o
Chains got me starring out the peep hole
Schizophrenic, but I keep it on the d-low
, don't tell them what we know
Money's the route of all evil, amigo
Cake it, cake it


I got the couple unmuted, I hid in my trunk
Hid in a coffin I'm housing it up
The strippers they throwing it up
God over money, I'm burning it up
Every young rapper we change in the game
Dorian Grey, you'll be hearing my name
Lion-hearts everywhere no we ain't lame (lion-heart)
Church and now I'm shaking my mane
Spirit domain
Glory to God in the highest, giving Him all of the praise
Prolly ain't nothing but plates
I wouldn't be massin' the route with Jesus' name
 no matter how much you all make
No celebration like who ate the cake
Winners so said it so what you do with Jesus Christ the only thing that will remain
What they saying, cake, cake, cake
They said they cake, they said they cake, they said they cake
Cake, cake, cake
I heard 'em say cake
They say the cake
They say the cake
They worry 'bout that cake
They focused on that cake
Oh oh
I ain't worry 'bout that
I tell them I
Burn it up
Tell 'em that I burn it up
Take that money and I burn it up
Money and I burn it up
Take that money and I burn it up
You know I do burn it up




I'm the mutha fuckin' man ALL CAPS
Uncut dope I be spittin raw raps
Real big dogs can't hang wit small cats
I be chillin' with the Forbes listers kickin' hard facts
Dressed in all black no Batman
See through every emcee no Cat Scan
Breakin' bare necks wit my black hands
Snappin' backs and
Leavin' bodies in the trash can
Chasin' 40 acres and some horse power
But the forecast say we gettin' more showers
Shit ain't sweet in fact its gettin' more sour
So I'm chasin' money everyday 24 hours
This rap shits the easiest
All (of) my bars the beefiest
I bring fire to the world like Prometheus
Catch me sailin' cross the 7 seas (like) Odysseus


Kick raps till the tracks deceased
I show ya how to make a masterpiece
I show ya how to make a masterpiece
I show ya how to make a masterpiece

I'm beyond a monster I'm passed a beast
I show ya how to make a masterpiece
I show ya how to make a masterpiece
I show ya how to make a masterpiece


10 years for a homi, $100 a jar
And I'm chargin' twice the amount on every dollar you borrow
Whatever happen tonight sun gon come out tomorrow
Till I cash out some rappers can't even come out the yard
This that black out
I'm just tryin to dump a cigar
And be gone before the police can even jump out the car
White America you know who we are
You see the squad
Give that internet gangster more ammo to feed his blog
I'm a real man
Feed my family then feed my dogs
Nothing left but humble pie and them haters can eat it all
Play rough when I ball but smoother than raw silk
Meth shoot it at your head from the booth no John Wilkes
Now how many has John killed
Got em screamin' infidel in the house that Sadaam built
You know the flow when its Meth Man ya boi spit it
Ya lady like me
Its more than likely
Ya boi hit it






Yeah, pull your shoes up
Why don't ya'll niggas sit your ass down somewhere
Meth, yeah, yeah *burp*

Yeah


Who next on deck? Yo, mark, ready, set
You get one guess, Meth, pass that dutchie pon de left
Take a deep breath, Meth, take that genie to the chest
It relieves stress, please believe it
Who your M-E-F'ing Man, go 'head, ask your man
And them broads with them big drawers, they know who I am
Call me Meth, like my niggas in Park Hill Projects
Just Meth, say it with the F, never disrespect


Give me dap, or give me depth, Clan in effect
While you shaking my right hand, I stab you with the left
What the fuck ya'll expect, I'm beyond bomb threat
Explode when I'm talking, I blow shit out proportion
Who's next, now, to be made an example
Timb boots stomping on them open toe sandals
Every boots scuffed, another win for us
Life's just fucked up, momma just didn't hug me enough
Let's you and I discuss over this bag of dust
My plans to make bags, up in God we trust ya'll
I ain't gotta, lift a, finger to touch ya'll
And I ain't got a middle finger you to fuck ya'll
Shit, as far as I'm concerned, ya'll germs
To the illest MC to ever get his turn
Street, you know the Life, money feed only on these dice
Don't wanna have to make my point twice




Who cashing checks every first and fifteen?
Who earnt they respect? Blunt brother from another mother
Southpaw, might Golden Glove ya
Now Enter the Wu-Tang Forever, The W
Ya'll been eating off our plate for years
And didn't know I spit in the pot
I'm on the toilet with some new shit, fitting to drop, lend me your years
For a minute, get in it, "see murder", there ain't "no limit" to the killing
Emotional wreck, cuz I ain't feeling what ya'll feeling
Ya'll rappers is sex with penicillen, who the villain?
Burning MC's, sick as the V's when he illing
A hundred degrees in dungarees, still chilling
You know me by now, look out Tical
In your barn, at your Phat Farm, milking your cow
Street, you know the life, money feed only on these dice
Don't wanna have to make my point twice






Yo, blow my nose for me, man
Word up, man (fuck them)


Spit in your mouth, piss on your bitch
We them wrist getters, everything real bout this, duke
You fucking with them niggas that's splashed up, slave master's master
Dumb move, blast your slut
We want it all, living in Persia, burn something
Snow White rose, bulldog ershkama
Yo take that, drive that around the corner


Yeah, shit on your crew, nigga, it's Wu
Rap athletes, the trap sheet bigger than you
If you ask me, the Cash Rule
Nigga, eat that pussy, you cat food
I sneeze on the track, get at you
I'm sick in the head, I'm getting some head
If she ain't bout getting some bread, don't get in this bed
Real talk, mami, you gotta bounce


Wild like Indians, Al Capone-ians
Not from Chicago, my gun named Margo
It's only when we in beef, we humble in deep
Might kill four-five niggas, die in my sleep
I argue though, who the best, we hardly know
I came through in the S, wash me, yo
Yo, yo, do that for me, go around that car


Niggas, digging they nose, and digging they ass
When I got chips, can't none of ya'll dig in my bag
I pop shit, my killas is black, I got chicks that got chicks

Wake up every morning eat that Captain Crunch cereal

Fresh to death, I'm always, always Rae in the hallways

Ya'll rappers gon' feel my pain, but the other way around
When it's going down, I'm gon' reign
That's my chair, nigga, get the fuck out of it


Yo, fuck you, pay me, if Dirt Dog could see me now
He'd probably say "Fuck you, pay me"
Blowing smoke clouds, shit's crazy
Doorag your dome, get wavy, rap ain't done shit for me lately
It's ass backwards, this game trynna play me

Get money, fuck them haters, real talk


Pay me, play me, weigh he, just the right measurement
This may happen in a day, G

Industry pussies, we can't feel these
Regardless that I'm paid in flossy, rich in the mind
I do this for the nine niggas who forced me
Ya'll niggas is playing me, man




Back with another one, this hip hop shit ain't over
The Wu brought it back I told you
Chef shit is hard
The hip hop critics is dick heads, they'd rather see Shallah in the yard
Writing rhymes that's soft as cotton
We can never ever see that, the nigga flow grows is poppin'
First verse I'll be ready to get clowns
Catch 'em in hallways, the worst look get laid down
And yo, I rhyme for shooters and boosters
Get money churchmen, all those respect my Wu shit
Regardless if you see me on TV
In 3D and HD, I'mma stay safe in Rae beats
This time I'm a bastard swordsman
Who put in that work, real quick then I'm repping to Boston
Don't try to get in my way
Any rapper any herb I'mma blow you like herbs and lick


Fuck a cell phone plan, with a ring I get a hundred dollars
Five dubs in a whip on my way to holler
Yeah I do credits, but not the ones you get in college
My niggas can't afford Benzes, so we rip impalas
Tints on the windows, lookin' like the Ds
Got the dope boys nervous when they see me in the street
Fuck the hollering on wax, you can see me if it's beef
Hollywood will load the gat and put the BBs in his fleece
I'm a preacher with the piece
I used to sell X on the west coast, now I get it cheaper on the east
I've been around the world like Lisa Stansbury
TV with the goosenecks, goosenecks to the cranberry
Got the Clan ready with the 10 Chevy, keep my grams heavy
Slap a bitch ass, doggy style, like my hand's heavy
G up in my swag, tough talk'll get your man buried
Blow the last dragon, part two, nigga, fists of fury


I could care less if you're well know shooters
100 guns, 100 clips, but you still can't move
It's been a while since you heard a nice nigga from BK
Representin' the village, known for lettin' this heat spray
First grip we flipped took like a weekend, 3 days
Whole team runnin' 'round the Ps with AKs
9 different types of drugs, slipping 'em 5 ways
Gettin' rid of a brick in less than five days
I pop your head off, leave your brains on the sidewalk
My 40 cal, a rearrange to your sidetalk?
Where I go, my team, they gonna follow
Top Model hoes, with no game, they gonna swallow
Got a lotta foes, that's why my aim be on hollow
Die before I let you violate, nigga, live by the motto
Pimpin' through lanes, poppin' ?
At this rate, I'm gonna miss it, I might not witness tomorrow


You say you gangsta? Yeah I'm a gangsta
You pop that thang? yeah I pop that thang
Your clip on empty? My clip on empty
Your clique gon bang? Yeah my clique gon bang


Look, I hit a weed spot
Bypass niggas with broke guns and cheap shots
Outlastin' niggas with no punch, y'all eat cock
Get too cocky, the heat cock
You wanna walk a mile in my shoes, you need socks
You need not call out a G, cause he's not
They playin' with a pussy, I'ma show 'em the G spot
This dude's a Meth-head, I'll show him the detox
Look at Johnny with his old ass
I'm still schoolin' the whole class
The kids in the hall, you get no pass
Ice hit the eye like a cold flash
Niggas hopin' I don't spaz
Speak for the have-nots and don't-haves
Fuck it, I'm thorough nigga, fuck their worlds
Meth clutch the mic, bitch niggas clutch their pearls
Tonight, I ain't feelin' no ice stares
If you want it, I'm right here, Staten Island and we don't fight fair


As a young lil' homie, I used to sell crack
I used to run in the front of the building and come out the back
Lil homie on the block with the fly ass gear
Me and my crew used to shop around Union Square
Ay yo, I never knew I would become an MC
Now everybody on the block be amazed at me
Because I rock the mic most definitely
Throw darts and I get fly on you, you know my steez
Buy 25 high?, yo, I stay low key
And if I have to pop something, yo, it's not my fault
I ain't tell y'all niggas try to crack my vault
I'm the new terrorist rapper, the main assault
You ? on your back, elbow a nigga thought
Through Wu-Tang lyrical kung-fu
Death when you enter, all my nigga will hunt you
Peace to the gods
One, two, one, two


Million dollar voice box
It's your choice, Ox
The face Ox cut off
Like tank tops
My motivation is money and mass murdering
While you still provin' you nice in rap tournaments
I be all smooth with the ice and mad burners
And plottin' on takin' your life
Look how I lure them in
Get drunk, smoke ashes up out the urn again
Axe murderin' journalist for the words they writ
Mathematics crafted the beat, called Term to spit
Cause I set fire to shit like a furnace lit
I pack German clips, stash box in the whip
Four door Optimus Prime, Transformer shit
Call the coroner, caskets for half price
Bodies in the trunk, movin' through the Mass Pike
It's all now, cause in Law town
We roll with premature babies
We carry four pounds




Back with another one, this hip hop shit ain't over
The Wu brought it back I told you
Chef shit is hard
The hip hop critics is dick heads, they'd rather see Shallah in the yard
Writing rhymes that's soft as cotton
We can never ever see that, the nigga flow grows is poppin'
First verse I'll be ready to get clowns
Catch 'em in hallways, the worst look get laid down
And yo, I rhyme for shooters and boosters
Get money churchmen, all those respect my Wu shit
Regardless if you see me on TV
In 3D and HD, I'm a stay safe in Rae beats
This time I'm a bastard swordsman
Who put in that work, real quick then I'm repping to Boston
Don't try to get in my way
Any rapper any herb I'm a blow you like herbs and lick


Fuck a cell phone plan, with a ring I get a hundred dollars
Five dubs in a whip on my way to holler
Yeah I do credits, but not the ones you get in college
My niggas can't afford Benzes, so we rip impalas
Tints on the windows, lookin' like the Ds
Got the dope boys nervous when they see me in the street
Fuck the hollering on wax, you can see me if it's beef
Hollywood will load the gat and put the BBs in his fleece
I'm a preacher with the piece
I used to sell X on the west coast, now I get it cheaper on the east
I've been around the world like Lisa Stansbury
TV with the goosenecks, goosenecks to the cranberry
Got the Clan ready with the 10 Chevy, keep my grams heavy
Slap a bitch ass, doggy style, like my hand's heavy
G up in my swag, tough talk'll get your man buried
Blow the last dragon, part two, nigga, fists of fury


I could care less if you're well know shooters
100 guns, 100 clips, but you still can't move
It's been a while since you heard a nice nigga from BK
Representin' the village, known for lettin' this heat spray
First grip we flipped took like a weekend, 3 days
Whole team runnin' 'round the Ps with AKs
9 different types of drugs, slipping 'em 5 ways
Gettin' rid of a brick in less than five days
I pop your head off, leave your brains on the sidewalk
My 40 cal, a rearrange to your sidetalk?
Where I go, my team, they gonna follow
Top Model hoes, with no game, they gonna swallow
Got a lotta foes, that's why my aim be on hollow
Die before I let you violate, nigga, live by the motto
Pimpin' through lanes, poppin' the clutch, getting the datto
At this rate, I'm gonna miss it, I might not witness tomorrow


You say you gangsta? Yeah I'm a gangsta
You pop that thang? yeah I pop that thang
Your clip on empty? My clip on empty
Your clique gon bang? Yeah my clique gon bang


Look, I hit a weed spot
Bypass niggas with broke guns and cheap shots
Outlastin' niggas with no punch, y'all eat cock
Get too cocky, the heat cock
You wanna walk a mile in my shoes, you need socks
You need not call out a G, cause he's not
They playin' with a pussy, I'm a show 'em the G spot
This dude's a meth head, I'll show him the detox
Lookin' Johnny with his old ass
I'm still schoolin' the whole class
The kids in the hall, you get no pass
Ice hit the eye like a cold flash
Niggas hopin' I don't spaz
Speak for the have-nots and don't-haves
Fuck it, I'm thorough nigga, fuck their worlds
Meth clutch the mic, bitch niggas clutch their pearls
Tonight, I ain't feelin' no ice stares

You thinkin I'm on your back, elbow a nigga thought
Push through Wu-Tang lyrical kung-fu
Death when you enter, all my nigga will hunt you

And you don't stop the body rock, pop yo Glock

Mover, puffin' on a fat blunt from Cuba
It's the Meth-Tical jet to Cal, I'm the buddha
Monk on the hunt for machine gun foes
I keeps you open like a slug from the shotgun punk
Double-barrel, yeah Meth bring it to them proper
Partner, you ain't got no wins in me casa
Straight up, you movin' too fast so baby wait up
Took one, added seven more now you eight up
Get on down wit' your bad self
Get on down, listen to the sound, come on
Few can ever get this whole commit legit
See you all up in my dick
But you don't know shit, uh-huh
What's your definition of a real emcee
From what you dedicated, hey it must be me
Meth-Tical, a lewd descendant of the loud hip-hop
I go on to the break of dawn, and just don't stop
Give me the green light, and the sign one way
Have you had your meth today
Huh, move it in, move it out
Stick it in, pull it out
Shake it up, shake it down
Come on down, Meth-Tical
Oh I often pray that I will
But today I am still
Just a...

Rrrappers can't get with the style extra wicked
Rap flow is bangin' like butter on a biscuit
A tisket, a tasket I'm not tryin' to have it
Mic flow show up and try to grab it
?

I breaks it down, I gets loud for my crowd
Filthy, dirty like a worm underground
Turn into a crazy early bird, that's my word
Before I kick the bucket I'm a kick 'em to the dirt
Check out the cloud, smoke out from the mouth
Other brothers got mad love (?) style for the hood, hey
Enter the square if you dare
Without a fro, I'm so raw that I'm real
I'm goin' to the country, I'm goin' to the fair
To see the senorita, with flowers in her hair
And get mine, cuz she love me long time
Bartender bring more wine
Get in line for the...

Patty cake, patty cake, hey, the Method Man
Don't eat Skippy, Jif or Peter Pan
Peanut butter 'cause I'm not butter
In fact I snap back like a rubber band

And I don't eat green eggs and ham
Style will hit ya, wham! Then goddamn
You be like, "Oh shit, that's the jam!"
Turn it up, now hear me get buck w-w-wild

Upside, downside, inside and outside
Hittin' you from every angle, there's no doubt I
Am the one and only Method Man
The master of the plan, rappin' shit like Saran
Wrap, with some of this and some of that
Hold up (what?) I tawt I tat I putty tat
Over there, but I think he best to beware
Of the diggy dog shit right here
Yippy yippy yay yippy yah yippy yo
Like Deck said, this ain't your average flow
Comin' like rah ooh ah achie kah
Tell me, how you like it so far, baby paw?
The poetry's in motion coast to coast and
Rub it on your skin like lotion
What's the commotion? Oh my Lord
Another corn chopped by the Wu-Tang sword
"Hey, hey, hey!" like Fat Albert
It's the Method Man, ain't no if ands about it
It's the Method


All right, y'all, get your White Owls
Get your meth, get your skins

And I'm about to go and stick it
Yes, I'm about to go and stick it, uhh


H-U-F-F, huff, and I puff
Blow like snow when the cold wind's blowin'
Zoom, I hit the mic like boom!
Wrote a song about it, like to hear it? Here it goes
Question, what exactly is a panty raider?
Ill behaviour savior or major flavor
All of the above, oh yeah, plus seducer
Also flam I'm the man, call me super
Not an average Joe with an average flow
Doin' average things with average hoes
Yo, I'm super, I'll make a bitch squirm
For my Super Sperm (check it)
Check it, I give it to you raw butt-naked
I smell sess, pass the method
Let's get lifted as I kick ballistics
Missiles and shoot game like a pistol
Clip is loaded when I click bang dang
A Wu-Tang slug hits your brain
J-U-M-P, jump, and I thump
Make girls rumps like pump and Humpty Hump
Wow, the Shaolin style is all in me
Child, the whole damn isle is callin' me
P-A-N-T-Y R-A-I-D-E-R, mad raw, I don't cry
Meaning no one can burn or toss and turn me
Ooh, I be the super sperm
Chim chimmeny chim chim cherie
Freak a flow and flow fancy free
Now, how many licks does it take
For me to hit the Tootsie Roll center of a break?
Peep and don't sleep the crew's mad deep
Wu-Tang, fadin' motherfuckers like bleach
So to each and every crew
You're clear like glass I can see right through
Your whole damn posse be catchin' 'em all, 'cause you vic'd
And you didn't have friends to begin with, I'm

Wu-Tang Killa Beez on a swarm
(Y'alls all have just been taken
Through the 36 Chambers of death, kid)
{Word to mother, Method Man signin' off, peace}




My repertoire is militant
The last days, what the blood is we dealing with?
The Johnny Blaze, grab yo' pistol
Teflon, mega-bombs, and heat-seeking missiles
Time to go to war, shit's official
The mic stalker, only if you can understand it
The sky walker, that be leaping over planets
Pain! Got that ghetto blood in my vein
Spread it through my kin, confess my sins, and blame
Society for unawareness, fuck the president
He dont represent the ghetto resident
Recognize fool within the black coal theres a jewel
The revolution been in effect, pull up your shoe
Utilize your third eye it be in my eye
Now I choose who gotta die - him, every time
Ticallion stallion now hold on
Like black diamonds, stud medallions, and so on

Direct from the Shaolin slum, here I come
Straight from the top, the cock, yo I'm fed up
I put it in your ear and fuck your whole head up
Wu-Tang's gang bang, up your butt crack and
Straight from Staten, silky like satin
Used to break clicks with stones and sticks
Nowadays we do it with the macs and clips
The method, man
The method, man
The method, man
Yes I am, yes I am

Who lit that shit it was I the chinky-eye
Chiba-hawk from New York, Tical Staten Isle
Niggas thought, that they could walk a dog but they caught
A bad situation, cause I'm a sandwich short
Of a picnic, cause you ain't equipped with the sickening
Style, blowing up the spot like ballistic
Missiles, I be comin through like the four-nine-three-eleven
Tearing up the power-u, Meth-Tical
A bad motherfucking buddah monk, what the fuck
Hit your chest, like cardiac arrest, blow the front
Out the frame, hit the pussycat for the pain
Of the dog shit, nobody move run your garments
A rugged vet, terrible like a Champion sweat
Wrap a power in a tec, to wet
A nigga up, with all the dangerous diseases
Sniffling, sneezing, coughing, aching, stuffy head fever
Fucker, I think it's bout time that you suffer
Bobbing on my knob like an all day sucker
Bitch!

You could try to front, get smoked and that's that
Lyric assassin, dressed in black rugged
Sixteen shots to your mug, from a slug then
I go to war in a concrete jungle, making bundles
Niggas act funny, and fumble
But I relax, count my shells, a lot of heads gotta fly
Niggas stay strapped, armed to die
Time for jet-black Tim boot, flowin
Wha-Su God get him, hit em with the nine troop

Bloodshot in that direction, cypher
Attack you like chess moves best move

With some quick high Rae stay fly, and rob your Isle
Airwaves, yo behave
Now you're a slave with the boots that paved the way




Duel, worthy of a general
If you want to fight, fight with me!
One to one! Man to man!


Get ready to gel team!
Live and direct from the one-six-ooh
We got Tical, pow! Raekwon the Chef, Tical!
It's about to go on, Tical!
You make the call, I make the call!
It's all for all
Method Man, Raekwon the Chef
(count my shells)
And there's about to be one left
(count my shells, nigga)
I know you know it's on kid
(Bring that shit I don't give a fuck!)
*bell rings*


Who lit that shit it was I the chinky-eye
Cheeba-hawk from New York, Tical Staten Isle
Niggas thought, that they could walk a dog but they caught
A bad situation, cause I'm a sandwich short
Of a picnic, cause you ain't equipped with the sickening
Style, blowing up the spot like ballistic
Missiles, I be comin through like the four-nine-three-eleven
Tearing up the power-u, Me-Tical
A bad motherfucking Buddha Monk, what the fuck
Hit your chest, like cardiac arrest, blow the front
Out the frame, hit the pussycat for the pain
Of the dog shit, nobody move run your garments
A rugged vet, terrible like a Champion sweat
Wrap a power in a tec, to wet
A nigga up, with all the dangerous diseases
Sniffling sneezing coughing aching stuffy head fever
Fucker, I think it's bout time that you suffer
Bobbing on my nob like an all day sucker
*bell rings* Bitch!
Meth Vs. Chef
(it's my turn) Meth Vs. Chef
(yo let's bring that shit baby) Meth Vs. Chef
(yo, yeah, one more time nigga) Meth Vs. Chef
(callin me out, it's goin off) I blow your fuckin ass to death
*bell rings*


I'm going all out kid no turnbacks
You could try to front, get smoked and that's that
Lyric assassin, dressed in black bugging
Sixteen shots to your mug, from a slug then
I go to war in a concrete jungle, make the punt
Cause niggas act funny, and fumble
But I relax, count my shells, a lot of heads gotta fly
Niggas stay strapped, armed to die
Time for jet-black Tim boot, flowing
Wha-Su God get him, hit em with the nine troop
No question, cha-cha-BLOW in the session
Bloodshot in that direction, cypher
*bell rings*
Attack you like chess moves best move
Yo, yeah, yo
The boards, your ass
'Tack, 'tack, 'tack, uH! *bell rings*
'Tack the boards like chess moves best move
At Rae through, comin at your motherfuckin crew
Live direct, yeah you better step
Gunshots ring on the set, let's jet
Motivate, to the gate
With some quick high Rae stay fly, and rob your Isle
Airwaves, yo behave
Now you're a slave with the boots that paved the way
*bell rings three times*
Ahh shit!

Chef Vs. Meth Vs. Meth

Dumb move, blast your slut

Yo take that, drive that around the corner
Yeah, shit on your crew, nigga, it's Wu
Rap athletes, the trap sheet bigger than you
If you ask me, the Cash Rule
Nigga, eat that pussy, you cat food
I sneeze on the track, get at you
I'm sick in the head, I'm getting some head
If she ain't bout getting some bread, don't get in this bed
Real talk, mami, you gotta bounce
Wild like Indians, Al Capone-ians
Not from Chicago, my gun named Margo
It's only when we in beef, we humble in deep
Might kill four-five niggas, die in my sleep
I argue though, who the best, we hardly know
I came through in the S, wash me, yo
Yo, yo, do that for me, go around that car
Niggas, digging they nose, and digging they ass
When I got chips, can't none of ya'll dig in my bag
I pop shit, my killas is black, I got chicks that got chicks
My real world realer than rap
I'm hot, bitch, material, Meth, beyond lyrical
Wake up every morning eat that Captain Crunch cereal
That's that shit right there
Dick game super, grupa fish, Cris' Krug' lottos
I'm a bring it back, one wish
Fresh to death, I'm always, always Rae in the hallways
Yeah, always stay
Ya'll rappers gon' feel my pain, but the other way around
When it's going down, I'm gon' rain
That's my chair, nigga, get the f*ck out of it
Yo, f*ck you, pay me, if Dirt Dog could see me now
He'd probably say "F*ck you, pay me"
Blowing smoke clouds, shit's crazy
Doorag your dome, get wavy, rap ain't done shit for me lately
It's ass backwards, this game trynna play me
I bet this never happens to Jay-Z
Get money, f*ck them haters, real talk
Pay me, play me, weigh he, just the right measurement
This may happen in a day, G
I'm a keep it real, for real G's, niggas is lame

Milk, milk, lemonade
Milk, milk, lemonade
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the corner, fudge is made


I used to think that my tits was where it's at
Used to be concerned that my booty was too fat
But now I know the truth and that worry has been shot
Big booty's what they want and big booty's what I got

 x2


Tits are old news if you know what I mean
All the guys love my fudge machine
Look me in the eye
Get your face in, don't be shy
You say you don't like asses
Cause I fart and break your glasses


Turd cutter
Loaf pitcher
Dookie maker
Fudge machine
Cheektastic
Booty mastiff
Giant tuchus
Fudge machine


On my booty empire, the sun never set
Take a shot, yeah, nothin' but net
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the corner, fudge is made
I'm gonna make you scream and shout
For the part of my body where poo comes out


This is where my poo comes out (x4)
Talkin' 'bout my fudge machine (x4)


That's right, ladies
Ain't nothing better than a big, beautiful sexy booty
But bottom line, no matter how find a behind
You better call that onion what it really is
That's just a fudge machine
Turn up




This is where her poo comes out
This is where your poo comes out
This is where their poo comes out
This is where our poo comes out

 x2
This is what you think is hot
This is what you think is hot
This is what you think is hot
Talkin bout my fudge machine


It's where your poo comes out




Let us milk this cow, the best way we know how
Park Hill projects, chicka-POW
One culture, return of the track slasher
Double doser, Cappadonna broadcaster
Strivin for perfection, the only way I got
My life back was through investin, devotion
Movin my soul toward the skit, vocabulary
Comin out my ass like shit, to feed my babies
I gotta fight y'all MC's, this money
Be gettin me high just like cheese in these tracks
I milk for all my childhood, make me feel good
So I keep on writin meditatin in the ghetto
Makin love waitin for lost minds to settle
Then I speak out, because we all need the guidance
Deep down inside us where you could define science
My mother told me, when I was so stressed out
"All you gotta do is just put your best out"
And I did it, milky
Milk this cow (2X)
Milk this cow, the best way we know how
Park Hill projects, chicka-POW!


Hold your own nigga, Razor Sharp with the art
Don't gettin blown nigga, throwin darts at the charts
Danger Zone nigga, Cappadonna
You know the stee' potnah, Wu-Tang death before dishonor - what?


Yo, new Cappadonna is about to exhale kid
Hold all the phone calls, stop all the mail
Cappadonna raise hell, speak and I broke the shells
Seen brothers that fell when I slipped
I had my alibi tight that night, up in the Hill chillin
Y'all'll get shot, move away things are too hot
Look at my spot now, friends are exiled from close distance
I flow persistence, every time I step up, I rip reps up
Ku Klux, my words swing around like numchucks
This ain't for big bucks, never can quit this rap shit
It feeds my seeds, I can barely breathe
But y'all cats better believe keep off, the darts are soft
While I throw these missiles, at your skin tissue
You can't escape I absorb, gigantic crowds all aboard
Watch out for shitty fraud, my darts slam like doors
Makin it hard for you to get yours, selfish

 (x2)
Milk this cow, the best way we know how
Park Hill projects, chicka-POW!








Bad birds that fuck nerds! *inhaling*
Hah! *inhaling*
Suck a dick up til ya hiccup motherfuckers!
The swarm continues, Wu-Tang Killer Beez
Cappadonna Cappucino, the Donna-mite
Came to treat your earpiece right
Y'all better recognize and realize
Hot Nixon, playin my position, bitch!

*gunfight*




Say what? (Niggas gon' think I got beef)
Say what? (Come on, come on)
Say what?


Hit you with the new Millenium Line-Up
Niggas is hons but yo we all fired up
Leavin industry heads and CEO's tied up
Talk is talk, you get ya jaw wired up


Made from the best shit on Earth
I bring it to ya first, sick verse from the dirts
In the darkness we lurk, load a cartridge and burst
On the scene, like a news team
Let 'em all Eye Witness, the Method how I do things
Perfected, my routine's are hectic and knockin
General Electric, I'm shockin (bzzz)
Now who top ten? The rotten, Clan once forgotten
Niggas poppin Crys' now, they stock market droppin
They poison, I'm the antitoxin, that keep the party rockin
And got me for assault, Johnny Cochran
Get me off, grant in the vault, if I walk
Put that order in the court, yeah
Jimmy Crack callin, who the fuck really care? (Yeah)
World best prepare for Tical 2, beware
Or be gone outta here, you be warned
Fuck off, get off that bullshit
And take the fuckin tux off, now it's on


Thug style, far from a pretty boy
My hardcore murder got DJ's screamin, "I told ya"
Hardcore composer, creapin even closer
Solomon scriptures written upon my shoulders
Militant rap vultures
How dare you and your crew pull out to battle!
Annihilation, throw in ya towels
Peep my West Brighton wolves start to howl
See, '74, March 9 style, it's on
So be prepared to fight
Lyrics hotter than a B-Town night
Rap formats for combat
Solomon'll throw elbows, so stop frontin
Mama said, "God forbid my baby take the time to write somethin"
MC's levitated, live in concert hotter than Earth, Wind & Fire
The worlds collide and divide, see my style of haywire




What? Uh!
Fuck the mic, spark the hydro, natural like the rhino
Knock you out like shadows on stage, ya hottest rival
Might get stiffle, and watch the crowd bounce ya life out
Raise the lifeforce, my only aim is like the rifle
Street is cycle, here in this game here we disciples
We only get triffle, open ya eyes you see a bible
Stainless scapel, BS will touchin collateral
Fuck the manuals, the automatic'll leave you casual
Drop you lateral, then charge you like a bitch's vaginal
Bring ya can-a-dles, let you know that's only flammable
Leave ya several, ya nice whore screamin for medical
My verse is federal, gettin money from this chemical
The only mineral, is Money Makin niggas physical
So use ya visual, search the streets for ya crystal
('99) The mic is on, you only evacuate like pistol


Ah shit, it's '98 again
Yo, eh-yo, my man Big John keep my high to death
I'll empty this Tec to ya mouth 'til there's nothin left
Yo the feds wanna trap me but I got quick, first step
And I brawled out, so tell me what's next (Yeah)
I used to let off, bust a Tec off
Pop the cork off, Moet off
Like Janet, it's time to +Set it Off+
Let's history, I'm makin all y'all niggas feel my misery
Pissy off the Crys', but Crystal mixed with Hennessy
Remember me? First with the GS3
+It's All About the Benji's+ like my man PD
No question 'bout my flow cuz I got it, got it
Think I'm Master P cuz I be +'Bout It, 'Bout It+
I stay laced, all custom-made suits, Italiano
Beachhouse Carribiano, with Cap and Swiss models (Yo)
Yea, I know, you like my style cuz I be rippin this shit (Yeah)

Yea, yea, '99
Mr. Meth, Solomon Childs
My nigga Q, what? What?
And me, Son Don, uh
Yea, we out




Miranda *speaking Spanish*
Yo, man, just let her live, man, stop playing, man
Oh, shit, B, where's Miranda? (She with Chef)


I dreamed it, Chef out in Cuba, a ruger
Thirty thou' on him, out in Mr. Chow, blew a cloud on him
Seen a Latin chick, laughing, clapping
Like your style, homey, tell your proud, hit the Crystal
Now we chatting, coebers and klickos, who do this a size six
She split up, had a brick, I peeped those
Her jeans was fitted, hair twisted, long as a fuck
She looked Indian, titties was plump
Had juicy lips, dimples, imprint on her pussy was mad thick
She grabbed my dick, hopped in the window
We in the Monte Carlo, bravo, uncle named Pablo
Gun connect, and he had his poke in Los Cabos
Good money, honey was strung, playing Luther in the background
Spanish version, my bunny was horny as fuck
Working the kid, we burst later, lay in the bed
Duvet sheets, my face hit the spread
Then time me, I'm not the kind of nigga, I was cool down at night
Drop my gun, shorty, my nigga
Body was sexy, "Lexy, come here, nigga, take off your drawers
Let me suck your dick, nigga, it's yours
Got real watery, Corey, damn you got good dick
You forty" spit on it, position your jaw
Call me 8-Ball, this pussy like China, climb the Great Wall
Then she came like volcanos in the late fall


Lady Miranda, she half black and white like a panda
I met her at the BET Awards, in Atlanta
Glamour girl, shopping in Bloomingdale's, skin pure
Keep a fresh manicure, hands with the cutest nails
Wall Street banker, hold accounts with Jewish now
Big businessmen, who own stocks in computer sales
Meanwhile, I'm checking her jeans out, imagining
Her fat bubble, riding my dick, making her scream out
She got a mean mouth, her lips is like soup coolers
Hotter than niggas riding around with six rugers
Miss Beaulah took a day off with a rich jeweler
When she came back she had a suitcase full of Fig Newtons
I met her at a villa in Vancouver, blowing her man's buddah
Bumping Mary J. and that Grand Puba
Check the 411, from a smooth operator
Got some pictures of her naked, I'll send them to Un later


Ay Dio mio, mamacita ass bonita
Remind me of the nights of Del Rio
I met at the Cotto fights, playing my seat though
That night, the linen was white, me and my hijos
Live from Puerto Rico, San Juan, where niggas sniff pedrico
Look at your man wrong, finito
Girl you know how we go, you getting my grown man on
Fuck with you primo, maybe I'm hands on
I'll massage your ego and be the love of your life
You know your people, a thug and his wife
Gave a look, she was touching my ice, so I looked at my dick
Like don't worry, we fucking tonight
She boricua, cinnamon skin, sign is Libra
She like wife beaters and men that like to eat her
Then I meet your feet up, meet me in room 112, light this reefer
You act right, and after tonight, I might keep ya




Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home


Yeah yeah they want me locked down, fryin' in jail
Before you hear that I decided to tell, I'd rather die in a cell
I was framed like a wedding flick, 2 time felon
Still a predicate, doin' time, tell 'em that's a negative
Prejudice judge, bails be a mil' in cash
Scorin' money like the meter on the Yellow Cab
Give the witness an unexpected visit
Make his story change like walls blockin' his vision
Couldn't give a clear description, fearin' the repercussions
Like, "I was on the ground, I ain't see him bustin'"
Now the DA chasin' a plea, they hatin' I'm free
The case is mistaken identity


Whoever push me like Pusha T, I push back
I push a cap, before '93, I pushed crack
I'm hood, black, you know me well, what's good, scrap?
I'm smokin' rappers, you are a L, what's good Smack?
Hold up that's Goodz rap, pardon self
I just like good rap, but when I see Goodz I give his goods back
I rap for writers that pack strap to rhymers that backpack
To 25 to lifers that jack MAC
We movin' ratchets, no Kat Stacks, it's magic
The way we flip the package before the coppers can catch it
I'm past that chapter in life, let's live it lavish
When life take a piss in your bed, you flip the mattress
Before you try and get my head, get you some Pampers
Then take a long look at my ish and get your answers
Kick in my vicinity, I'm what rappers pretend to be
Charge 'em with a penalty, mistaken identity


Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy


Fresh off of work, he jumped out the van
Two suitcases, dangle from his hands
He opened up the door, headed up the stairs
Thought he heard a noise, but no one else was there
First sight he saw, struck him by surprise
Two shots was given, between his girl's eyes
Windows blown out, no prints on the door
All he seen was blood stains, smear the damn floor
911, ambulance showed up
Blood everywhere, paramedics throwin' up
Cops cuffed him up, hit him with the charge
But he was bangin' Mrs. Prixy at the Motor Lodge
He got his alibis, gonna use 'em all
He screwfaced the judge, he might take the fall
Someone set him up, a botched robbery
Mistaken identity, yeah it gotta be


17 years old, I'm headed back to the hole
I'm mistaken identity, every way was sold
I look like a hoodlum, I rock a lot of gold
They lockin' everybody up, ship your ass up the road
I ain't have a 9 on me, they was lyin' on me
Court day with my old bird, they was spyin' on me
Tried to set me up, plantin' coke in my pocket
The beast pat me up, they won't let me off


Na-n-n-n-n-nah it wasn't me
It could never been the G-O-D, not me
You terribly mistaken, son, I ain't the one
We could never look nothin' like, whether near or far sight
What resemblance does he strike? So my mic Fahrenheit
W for my a-alike, your DNA match tight
Even if they bite us, close but not quite
They still tryna get it right, mistaken identity


Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy



Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
Wanna go home..
Wanna go home..
Wanna go home..
Wanna go home..


Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy

Don't hit the bathroom for like 40/45 minutes

I never cruise, I work to be the top gun
And Im a dog off the collar, the marijuana globetrotters
You got bud, I holler

We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)
Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)


It's the four horsemen call reinforcements
We ain't looking for endorsements, we absorb your portions
We can roll the indo or sativa if you need to
Got a warehouse poppin' with the  she's a heater
Two on the lighter with tightest bitches, dancing getting higher
They all fire ladies never tire
Got her soul inspired now we flossing out
Sipping on some Hen 2.0, for your cotton mouth
This beat is banging like a Cali block in the 90s
Really fucking grimey and the po-po's right behind me
16's popping, smoke blowing out the window
When we roll up in the spot it's very simple


Uh, yeah, uh-uh
That's what you do
Mt. Kushmore in the building
Big Snoop, Method Man, Redman, B-Real
Shout out to Wiz Khalifa and Sen Dog, you know! G-yeah!


I ain't here to bring the East back (nah), I'm here to relapse
And now I'm outta rehab they ask me where the weed at
Go get a weed app (homie), I got that weed that have your P.O getting P.O, ask me where to pee at
My G, pack the streets of New York, I give em G-Rap
I'm cool, on the road to riches to get my G back
I'll bee dat! Killa Beez mind your beeswax
Past 10 o'clock when ya still don't know where your seat at
Ask Big Snoop, it don't take a Crip to see that
Be real, what you read about Meth Man, believe that
I'm nice, I gots no chill, go get a ski hat
In fact, put ya twitter on ice, chill with the feedback


From the days of Cheech & Chong, to Willie Nelson
Everywhere that I go, I blow fo sho, you smelled it
A lot of y'all fucking with me, saying I'm on your bucket list
But I ain't the one to be fucking with
See, I'm like a quick game of tic-tac-toe
Take three in a row
Aye lil nigga, gon hit that door
I'm back with my niggas Earth wind, no snow
And I got the fire on Mt. Kushmore
So let it rain like the leaves of a cannabis plant
When I say it, I mean it as a matter of fact
Well I outta, slip mo dick in your daughter, for starters
Leafs by Snoop, may I take your order?


Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)
Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke

*bees buzzing*
*man screaming in torture*


This is... (Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream)
Serious, the craziest.. Da.. da!
(Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream)
Day-da.. danger, dangerous... style


Lyrical shots from the Glock
Bust bullet holes on the charts
I want the number one spot
What's the science? I'm a giant
New York defiant, brutal like domestic violence
Silence of the Lambs, occurred when I slammed in
Program the jams to be fat as Ralph Kramden
Others come with shit as silly as Art Carney
But my technique tranquilizes more kids than Barney
Remedy for stress is three bags of sess
A day at my rest playing chess, yes
My thoughts be sneaky like a crook from Brooklyn
When you ain't lookin, I take the queen with the rook then
I get vexed, layin phat trax on Ampex
Puffin skunk, gettin drunk off of Triple X
Ballantine, I got more love than valentines
The violent mind, I blast with a silent nine


My hazardous thoughts to cut the mic's life support short
Brains get stained like tablecloths when I let off
Powerful, poetry pushed past the point of no return
Leaving mics with third-degree burns
Let me at 'em, I grip your style like a spasm
Drag 'em through the mud then I bag em
We're screaming hardcore, hip-hop drips out my pores
And I be raw, for four score plus seven more
I strike like a bowling ball, holding y'all hostage
Like jail, electrifying like the third rail
Beats are smashed with paragraphs of ruckus
Wu-Tang!


(Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck wit...)
Hot time, summer in the city
My people represent, get busy
The heat-seeker, on a mission from hell's kitchen
I gets in where I fits in for head-touchin, listen
Enemy, is the industry got me flippin
I don't give a fuck tell that bitch and a nigga
I'm killin, snipin, catchin murder cases
Desert Stormin', I be searchin for oasis
As I run a mile with a racist
Pullin, swords, hit the Billboard with a bullet
Peace to the number seven
Everybody else get the four nine three eleven


(Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream)
I don't know what's going on if you can take us there...


Yo, watch me bang the headpiece there's no survival
My flow lights up the block like a homicidal
Murder, underground beef for the burger
P.L.O., criminal thoughts you never heard of
I switch, the city never sleeps, life's a bitch
I shit, runnin through bitches like Emmitt Smith
Caution, niggas best to be careful crossin
The street, before they end up layin in a coffin
Don't sleep, niggas tend to forget, however
Peep this  my nigga Kase lives forever


What evil lurks in the heart of men?
It be the shadow, street-life, flowing again
I had a plot, scheme, I knew for sure
Only one kick would knock the hinges off the door
The dread tried to jet, Sabrina at his neck
Thirteen pounds on the table plus a tec
Just when I said, "Where the fuck's the cream?"
Another dread came out the kitchen with the M-16
He tried to cock it, blast three shots like rockets
Crushed his collarbone, ripped his arm out the socket
My move for the table was swift, I got my hostage
(The nigga tried to stab you God!) but I dodged it
Niggas said, "Carlton you'se a ill motherfucker"
Cause I made it look like they both killed each other
And I'm out


Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream
Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream


You know what I'm saying? (Tical)

Dedicated to all the beautiful people in the house
You know who you are
Yeah, Redman, Method Man, Blackout! 2

Hair and nails done up, girl, you got your act together

The G4 is ready to fly, is you ready to ride?
Let's go


International (Now we can creep, we can lay on the beach, you know

Dj....Premier...


Uh uh uh
Who could be the boss?
Look up to the cross
Stranded in the land of the lost
Standin up I'm sideways
I'm blazin up the path
Runnin' on the highways of rap
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal
A lotta stamps and brands be like a bar code
I'm bashin all the media strikes
To keep the media dykes
As reinforcements for the fight
And that alone'll keep John Gotti on the phone
I'm tangled in the zone
I got the bees on the track
Where the fuck you at? (Tical!)
Let me hear you pigeons run ya mouth now
(Meth: Shut the fuck up!)
I'm pluggin in them social skills
That keep my total bills
Over a million
The last time I checked it
Thank God I'm blessed with a mind that'll wreck it
Wait until the second round and knock em out


They call me Big John Studd
My middle name Mud
Dirty water flow
Too much for you thug
And can't stand the flood
What up Doc? Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd
The sureshot
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged (learn)
Temperatures too hot for sunblock (burn)
Playin wit minds
That get you state time
Locked behind 12 bars from a great mind
Killa bees in the club
Wit this ladybug
Brought a sword to the dance floor
To cut a rug
Love is love all day
Till they throw slugs
And take another life in cold blood
Can't feel me til its your blood
Murder rates tremendous
Crime is endless
Same shit different day
Father forgive us
They know not what they do
All praise is due
I'm big like Easy
And Big Bambu


Whats that, I didn't hear you
(Shut the fuck up)
Come on, a little louder
(Shut the fuck up)
Everybody in together now

Headstrong, dead calm (Dead By Dawn)
Dead weight they dead wrong, let's get it on
Twelve rounds of throw down, who hold crown
Protect land wit 4 pound, Limp Bizkit
Get around like merry-go, bust a scenario
Comin through your stereo, why risk it?
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted
8 essential vitamins and minerals, delicious
Word on the street is, they bit my thesis
Knocked out they front teefes, tryin to taste mine
Actin like they heard it through the grapevine
Dope fiendin for the bassline, to provide rhyme
Pharmaceuticals - hard as nails to the cuticles
Where you find that monster, she beautiful
Wu-Tang and Limp Bizkit roll on the set
Kick a hole in the speaker pull the plug and then jet


Mic check
So whats it all about? (bout)
And where we gonna run? (run)
Maybe we can meet up on the sun
Discretion is advised
For the blood of virgin eyes
We limpin on the track with the Method
So get the sunblock (sunblock)
You gettin one shot (haa)
Until you dissolve
I revolve
Around everything you got
From outta nowhere
Prepare
You be blinded by the glare
I told you not to stare
Now you're turned into stone
Without a microphone
But don't you forget you're in a zone
(So shut the fuck up)
And take that shit back
Cuz all your shits wack
(Doo doo is doo doo)
When its weighed out like that
Burnin up your brain like a piston
So all those that didn't listen
Now they even knew what they were missin
And never even knew that the sky was fallin' down
Wu-Tang Clan for the crown


Whats that, I didn't hear you

Never had a chance to be an infant I had to walk before I crawled
Had to dang near raise my siblings mama worked 3 jobs
Seen a lot of pan handlin' and gritt'in
Chicken flippin and dealin, dudes coming up missing
Empty banana clipping, it's been happening quite often
They pull up on the side and turn your car into a coffin
And ain't nobody talking because that's the rules of the soil, we beef over rap
The government beef over oil, we beef in the track
They beat on sacred, royal, ancient holding grounds
Thinking that it's righteous, way out of bounds


From New York to the Bay yo

Nobody move until we say so
They wanna know who got that N.A.S.A. music

Take the R out of brotha, but I ain't trying to botha

Shallow, grim, dark murky days
Slappin dominos on the porch with it
Real mannish with it, I rip it
Spit for the less fortunate
Me and Meth Merchant

We in this booch perkin and we stoked
They say there ain't no future in our hope
No life in our breath, scared to die, but quick to take a death

With his body in the drop, damn a little mommy hot
Off top, I want everything that little mommy got
And if I look sober that means I'm probably not

Genius and MTV have teamed up to bring you a new look into New York hip hop from 97 to 98. MTV has dug deep into their vaults and found three gems, each never before seen in its entirety. As part of an ongoing project, MTV is looking to the Genius community to add context and personal stories to these interviews with some of the all time greats

Here we have the second release in the collaboration between Genius and MTV.  The interview takes you on the set of the 4,3,2,1 video shoot featuring a cast of New York hip hop icons and captures several defining characteristics of New York hip hop in 97: LLs longevity, Method Mans prominence outside of Wu-Tang, and DMXs rising stardom.  Along with Redman, watch the four hip hop legends cut it loose during an otherwise tense time in the genres history

Interview by Abbie Kearse
_______________________________________________________

Interviewer:   All right. Well, I am glad we have got everybody together. It took a little work, it took a little work, but we have got everybody together. What I want to talk about first is L, I want to talk about getting this group together for your record. How did that come about?

LL Cool J:  Well, I felt like I had heard Meth and Red do a lot of records together andyou gotta pardon me, I'm a little hoarseI felt like they werethe teamwork that they displayed in their records was uncanny and I felt like they sounded real good and I could add a lot to that chemistry

Interviewer:   So you are talking about the record and the video for 

LL Cool J:  Yeah, like How High and the different songs that they made together. I felt like they were just powerful songs and it influenced me so much that I felt like I wanted to be a part of that because it felt so good to me. Then my man D, he is new and he is upcoming and he has got a lot of flavor. I feel like this would be a good opportunity to display some new people on the record as well. And I felt like all of us together, including Canibus, could make something that was going to be powerful and something that would influence people. Hopefully they might come back to hip hop and enjoy hip hop because this particular record, the essence of it just the vocals and each individual displaying what they feel, expressing themselves in an artistic matter. But at the same time, us gelling together to create one work

Interviewer:   I was going to say it definitely has more of an old school  are you all right?

LL Cool J:  Im pretty all right. Do your thing. You just do what you do

Interviewer:   Well, because we can stop

LL Cool J:  No, Im all right

Interviewer:   I was going to say that the record has an old-school vibe to it in the fact that each MC has their different line and their break. So was that something you had in mind when putting the record together to go back?

LL Cool J:  Yeah, well the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 thing was something that was real important to me because I felt like we were taking it back. What do you guys think?

Method Man: I wasnt listening

Interviewer:   This is what happens. You get a group together and Meth wasnt listening. Well, LL, you tell him

LL Cool J:  How do you feel about the old-school element of this? With it being like four or five MCs coming together? And the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 hook just bringing all that together. How do you feel about that?

Method Man: I feel like its only right to pay homage, you know what Im saying? To the brothers that brought it in here. Do you know what I mean? So far it is to come out and come on, Living Legend Cool J, you know what Im saying? Like, for us to even be here, its like the epitome of rap right now. You know what Im saying? We are about to take it and blow it out the frame. That is why we have to count it down, 4, 3, 2, 1 is about to blow up out this piece. Word up, its great to be a part of it, do you know what Im saying?

Interviewer:   Well, I wanted to talk about  you were talking about LL as a legend. I mean, you have been in the game for a long time and going back to those days of the records where it was really about the MC and almost the freestyle  so is this for you guys a freestyle type of record?

LL Cool J:  You know, a lot of times when people talk about freestyle it is interesting because being a student of hip hop and growing up on hip hop I learned that freestyle back in the day really was when you write a rhyme and then you say it. What people call freestyle now is what people used to call off the top of the head. So it kills me when people say freestyle because it 

DMX: Its something else

LL Cool J:  Yeah, its the wrong definition but it has taken on this ill kind of connotation. The reality is this was about guys putting forth what they write down and what they feel and expressing themselves as an artist. Each individual occupying their own space and making the statement that they want to make. And that is part of what we do. I think the whole country is about that, individuals being able to express themselves where they feel comfortable and say to the world what they feel comfortable saying. And displaying to the world what they are feeling emotionally

Interviewer:   So you are saying in the old days freestyle was more about you had a rhyme that you were rehearsing in your room over and over again, and that is what you came out 

DMX: Just talking mess, thats all. You are not talking about any particular subject, just talking about how good you are. That was freestyle to me. Because there are many styles of rap, you know what I am saying? Story rhymes, you know what I am saying? All types of styles. Freestyle to me is a style, not really speaking of any one particular subject, just how nice you are

Interviewer:   Well I want to go down the line and get some opinions of your  or what are some of your favorite freestyle raps that you have either done yourself or that somebody else did that is just one of your favorites over the years? So, Reg?

Redman: Freestyle  like, I mean, I mean, not to like  not too many artists that you can catch freestyle unless you cipher with them, you know what I am saying? I mean, unless they do a little skit on the album or something like that. You have got to catch a freestyle artist at a party or something where he get the mic and air it out, you know what I am saying? I really vibe off brothers from the street, like my piece that I am coming out with  I vibe off them freestyling on the mic. I am still taking the heat on the business level and the record industry level while they are still here taking the heat on the streets. So what they are freestyling about would be way different from somebody from the industry. So I really vibe off of up and coming artists, really

Interviewer:   Do you have any favorite? Either that you learned, what was your first rhyme that you learned? Or do you have a favorite?

Redman: I mean, as far as freestyle, sometimes you know, freestyle is off the top of the head but sometimes people use it as a meaning of freestyle, like the lyrics are straight up about anything. You could write a freestyle, just straight up talking about anything or any subject, any particular  you could jump from subject to subject. As a matter of fact, the freestyle is what got me on, you know what I am saying? With Bizmark EPMD. You know what I am saying? Bizmark took me to Monticello Park in Queens and I went down there and aired it out with a freestyle and people know me on the ground for freestyle rapping, do you know what I am saying? And when I did EPMD it was the same way. So it gives freestyle a bit more respect than it is, instead of just saying freestyle, freestyle

Interviewer:   Its an art

Redman: Its an art, its a technique, yo

Interviewer:   Meth, do you have a favorite? What was the first freestyle you ever did, whenever you got on the mic? I dont know, what was your first experience that you had to come up with something? What did you rap about?

Method Man: It was some old Gilligans Island rhyme or something like that, you know what I am saying? It had the theme to Gilligans Island in it. I dont really remember how it goes or whatever yet. It was one of my first joints but I had to come back strong after that. I remember they were throwing empty crack vials at niggas and all that shit. You know, we was up at the club and it was bad, up in the rec room party, 

Interviewer:   So do you see it as an art form that right now a lot of MCs dont appreciate because there is a lot  now that you have the studio and you can just go in there and push a button and do your, you know, you can do your thing and you dont have to do it live  do you think that as an art form that is kind of lost right now?

Method Man: Yo, man, its like I dont like for somebody to come up and ask me to rhyme off the top in the street like that. I dont care for a camera in my face or if we are on the radio, do you know what I mean? If I came here to do one thing, I am coming here to do one thing. So it is like when you know you are getting paid for this and this is a job, you hold in all your stuff. It is like, man, I aint giving this out for free no more. So when they say freestyle they get funny at times, like freestyle. There aint nothing for free. Thats why you got paidstyle now, you know what Im saying?

Interviewer:   Its paidstyle?

Method Man: For real, yeah, its paidstyle. Exactly. When its  the show is over and you is out, and you in the parking lot  because usually it is the parking lot or the hotel that we are at or whatever, and cats is there and they are starting it theyself, but they open it up enough for you to step in and listen, thats peace right there. Because they aint asking you for nothing. If anything, they give it. Like check us out, this is how we get down. And if you feel like you want to join in, join in. I will be out there until sunup. Perform for three hours and be out there until sunup

Interviewer:   Youre afraid that if you go on the radio, or like right now if you were to freestyle for us, you are afraid another MC is going to take that?

Method Man: No, its like I said man, I aint just going freestyle off the top like that and just come at you on some yo, this is , or whatever, like that

LL Cool J:  I think the analogy that is he is making is simply that as good as Michael Jordan is at basketball, the reality is he wouldnt stop at a playground and go in there and risk start dunking around and doing his thing, soaring over cracks in the asphalt to dunk glory, you know, at the playground. There are just certain levels to it. I think that freestyle is very important because it keeps you on your Ps and Qs and it makes sure that you are sharp in terms of the way you articulate what you are feeling. But you know, the reality is I think you have to constantly grow and there has to be growth there. You know?

Interviewer:   Oh wait, is everything okay? Is it all right?

Method Man: No, we were just saying how NEWS is like north, east, west, and south. You know what I am saying? Its all news. North, east, west, and south

LL Cool J:  Thats where it comes from, probably

Interviewer:   So DMX, I know that you are relatively new, at least to us

DMX: To the label, but not to the game though. Not to the game

Interviewer:   So how long have you been in it?

DMX: I have been on the floor for like 13, 14 years. You know what I am saying? I am only 26, so I just was doing it, you know what I am saying? And not even thinking about getting on, just doing it because I love doing it. Do you know what I am saying? I like doing it, I like getting the response, do you know what I mean? From my people

Interviewer:   So what about yourself? Do you have any favorite? Like, was there a certain  who, to you, do you feel was the best at the art of freestyling? I know you have got LL standing here, but you can honest

DMX: Thats a tough one. The best  I mean, I would have to say me. I mean, not  I would have to say that on the , you know what Im saying? But that I write what I like to hear, you know what Im saying? And niggas been doing it for a mad long time and there is much respect in all that, you know what Im saying? So you cant take nothing from nobody. But do you know what Im saying? But Im sure every one of us here feel the same way, were the best. I am, I mean, they all say that they are because you have to feel like that

Interviewer:   Well I know that Meth, you were saying that you want to get paidstyle, you want to get paid. But would you do something to give us a little example? Because 

DMX: You mean, would I do it now?

Interviewer:   Yeah, just a little something. I could do the human beat box

DMX: I mean, I got the curses. Do you know a lot of our stuff?

Interviewer:   Thats all right, too

DMX: All right, well if you want it like that  check it. Im headed nowhere fast, running in place, gun at my waist, niggas wanted a taste but wouldnt come at my face. So what that mean? You catch us playing games again, so now what do I do? Start naming names again. All you player haters know that I speak from the heart. You play like you dont know how  that you have forgotten about that will get you shot in your mouth. Got my dogs covered, plus its all gravy like chicken when its smothered. Its dark and I love it. Get him boy, let em loose. You want it with a dog or the gun, let him choose

Interviewer:   All right, thats a good one. So L, now, when you see whats happening today and what I was talking about is the luxury a lot of artists have of the studio. You could go in there and you could do your rhyme and you could say one line and do another and do it over and over again. Do you think that a lot of artists in hip hop today have lost the art of just being able to come up with something off the top of their head and have it flow?

LL Cool J:  I dont think so. I dont even  honestly, I dont even understand that question. I think that hip hop has only grown, you know? I mean, the reality is when something evolves it changes shape and I think that people have expanded on upon what already existed and taken it to the next level and I think that is important. I dont think that any of the true art of hip hop has been lost because like I always say music  art imitates life. And rap music imitates life because its art. And the mirror doesnt change, just the reflections in the mirror, you know? If ten different people stand in front of the same mirror, the mirror didnt change but the reflection will change. So something that he is rhyming about and feeling now, something that he is rhyming about and feeling now, and something that Melle Mel was rhyming about or what Run was rhyming about is going to be different. The art didnt change. It is still young, urban men, African-American men, expressing what they feel growing up in an inner city environment. It is just that socially things have changed. You know, Reaganomics have come and gone, different political policies have been implemented, so it is going to reflect in what they talk about

Interviewer:   Let me ask you about the style, Regs style, Meths style, DMX, what you like. I just want to get a sense of why you picked them, you put them on your record, what is it that 

LL Cool J:  I feel like the beginning of one of those old kung-fu movies or something. Redman, he is known for dah, dah, dah. Method Man, he is the  DMX. You know, they all do their thing

Interviewer:   But they do it different. That is what is interesting, is they all do it differently

LL Cool J:  They are different. They are different. You know, Red  his thing is like intergalactic and wild out, and he talks about things  he says things that make you laugh and make you feel good. And he just paints an interesting picture, do you know what I am saying? He makes you feel like, you know, like his whole zone  you know what Im saying, its a place that you want to be. You know, he makes you feel like it is a cool place to be, like you want to sit in his car and listen to him because he is talking about a lot of things that people dont know. And he has a very cool flow the way he rhymes tracks that makes you want to dance. You know, he can take the worst beat and just the way he sits on top of it makes you want to dance. And DMX, the way he delivers things makes you feel like he is full of confidence in that you believe him so much that it makes it more interesting for you because you believe that he believes what he is saying, and that is a good thing. Do you know what I am saying? And thats what I feel. And me, I just do what I do

Interviewer:   So what are we going to see that you are shooting here today?

LL Cool J:  What we are shooting today is a video that we are all involved in. It is called 4,3, 2, 1. It is a song on my album, Phenomenon. And there is an opportunity for everybody to just express themselves as artists and we came together and we are going to do some hip hop

Interviewer:   What about the look on this?

LL Cool J:  The look?

Interviewer:   Yeah, because this reminds me of a lot of the older rap videos where everything was shot in New York City kind of in this vibe, and now everything is color and you know  you know what Im saying. You know, hyped. So this kind of reminds 

LL Cool J:  This is more about what we are feeling as artists and just basic hip hop. It is very basic, it is very simple. There is no glitter. A little ice, but we will hide that

Interviewer:   But you know what I am saying, like how like now the videos, everybody has got a hot -

LL Cool J:  Its evolved, its evolved. And thats a good thing

Interviewer:   Yeah, and thats good. But it is kind of a look

LL Cool J:  It has evolved. I mean, there used to be a time when all rock videos, with guys with long hair doing this and breaking guitars. I mean, it evolves. Do you know what I am saying? It is cool. I think that it is just an opportunity for us to do something basic. It reminds me of head bangers, you know, back in the days with those kind of videos. It is just one of those things

Interviewer:   For . It looks a little like that

LL Cool J:  Yeah, you know what I am saying? And thats cool, I think thats a cool thing because it puts less emphasis on the set and the video and what it looks like and more emphasis on the artistry. You know what Im saying? I think that sometimes this is kind of like an unplugged, if you will, visually. Cinematically, you know what I am saying? Without all the glitz and glamour

Interviewer:   And you get to put on your winter coat, finally

LL Cool J:  Yeah, I get to put on my winter coat

Interviewer:   All right, well just one quick question I have to ask about  I know this is odd, I have to ask you about Thanksgiving. What does it mean 

LL Cool J:  That was a non sequitur. Im just playing, go ahead

Interviewer:   Well, I was asked to ask you about Thanksgiving. What does Thanksgiving mean to you?

LL Cool J:  To me? For me, Thanksgiving is an opportunity to be with my family, to share the meaning of love, to share our spiritual relationship and a spiritual intimacy with my wife, my children, my grandmother, my mother, and all those  all of my loved ones. Whether or not someone believes in a religious connotation of Thanksgiving is another issue. What it means historically, that is another issue. But relative to my family and me now it is just an opportunity for me to share love and to spiritually get closer, break bread, and be one. And unity, you know, with the family  that is very important, first and foremost

Interviewer:   That is a good answer. Reg? Thanksgiving, what does it mean to you?

Redman: Thanksgiving  I mean, it mean  what does that fall on, the 25th, right? I mean, it is like just eating some good food for a minute, man. You know, I mean, you know artist that be on the road or you know, we are doing our thing, sticking with this hip hop thing, it is a 24-hour 

Method Man: You miss it a lot

Redman: You know what I am saying, it is a 24-hour-a-day job for us, so you know, it is usually the Jamaican restaurant or something. Or the corner store sometimes because we dont have time to really go catch a quick meal, but you know that is one day. You know, we can certainly cipher and chill out. And eat some good, some good stuff

Method Man: Thanks for giving. Thanks for giving, I dont celebrate though. I dont celebrate, I dont celebrate, thanks for giving

DMX: Its just dinner man, dinner. Turkey, stuffing, all that type of shit. You know what I mean. Aint a whole lot to that. There aint a whole to that, its just food. Food, a lot of it, everywhere

Interviewer:   Okay, thats good. You know what they are doing something Beavis and Butthead and Kurt Loder, are going to be covering the parade

LL Cool J:  Yo man, you said Jamaican food, because you are on tour, dog?

Redman: No, just 

LL Cool J:  I am feeling you, fam. Im feeling you. Oh my God

Interviewer:   Thank you

LL Cool J:  Thanks for giving, yo. 4, 3, 2, 1, coming to a theater near you

I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Five score years ago, a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today


Look, homicide is illegal, death is a penalty
Never let go when you've got ahold of your enemy
Eagle claw cobra clutch by any means necessary
Ill never let it go, see my shadow ninja mic flow
I throw a great archer dart arrow to your temple
Almighty bow of Ulysseus the indigenous
Plan of the Wu-Tang Clan became a world brand
We never let it go, we talk a half a mil a show


Never let go of your mind
Its a terrible thing to waste
To lose, but its very hard to find
Being that ignorance is lethal
We must touch hearts, tune souls, harmonize the people
Never let go of your plan, execute
So when you shoot, inspire everyone on the land
Never lose knowledge of yourself
For it may become risk to your health
And great loss of wealth


Never let go of your cream, never let go of your dream
Players retire, but they never let go of the team
If you a rider then you never let go of that thing
Pull up your mans like you better let go of that bling
This lifes crazy, too many life sentences, maybe
Fatherless babies on the block but they father 380
Thats just the hood lately, never let go
Im what the hood made me
Momma told me to find a good lady


Never let go of staring at the death
Like yo, that's your best blow
I still hold on like En Vogue
The cold go to war with the heat
Eyes wide, never falling asleep
All the talking is cheap
Call'em, ultimate warrior, W.W.F
I come up victorious, struggle is nothing to Deck
Set it straight for the seeds, to see a better new
Take the real life by the rings and I aint letting go
I aint letting go


No matter what the odds be
No matter how hard we
You never let go


Never let go of the fight, never let go of the mic
My honesty, my values, my loyalty, my pride
And memory of those who have passed to the other side
Never letting go, Im never letting go of my beliefs
My faith, convictions, real
Both hands holding on, never let go the wheel
We hood legends, misunderstood
These lessons, learned
Growing up for manhood
Keep focus on the prize what you better do
A little taste of heaven, sunshine is where we headed to
States whats ahead of you, always on the schedule
Smoke the gold leaf down to the residue
Letting go, is something that I never do
Those who let go, live life regrettable
Never let go of your hope or your rope
Eyes on the prize, never let go of the scope
When Im in jail, never let go of the soap
Hold on, boy, never let go


Never let go, the all-eye-seeing, the supreme
Never let go the love of your seeds, or your queen
Never let go your heart, or the place you started
The feeling that I had, Wu-Tang had just charted
The old earth departed, I give thanks to the martyrs
I never let go the love I have for thy father
Never let go the glow
The more I know the more that it shows
I wont let go, even if I decompose
Your seed will carry it on, we need to carry it on
Pass the baton, life is just the marathon
And ain't' playing to win it, its an epidemic
Never let go, thats what the god recommended




And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. Who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. For many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom




Uh-huh, what up, son? Yeah
Maintaining, maintaining, you know?
You good, right? Everything proper, still, right?
Of course, come on, man, what's the matter with you, man?
Ain't nothing, I just want us to be on


Tell a friend, it's that symbol again, that W
Coming through, bust a shot on your block, give me a Soo!
Get it right, all my chicks hold ya tits, let's get it in
All my niggas take a toke off this weed, let it begin
Here we go, yo, ya'll already know what it do
Brand new, nigga, back from the slums, it be the Wu
Now throw ya W's up, back from the slums, it be the Wu


You know how to dress a lad, get rocked, hundred bags, black doorags
Ski masks is on, g-rags
Don't try to take pictures, relax, still in the grass
You'll learn respect, burst when I ask
Rhyme master busy, Rizzy on the subject
Love Deck, thug buried, drug vest, snub sets, iller than most
Night time toast, gorillas in boats, three votes
Realers is killa, gangsta feel notes
Hibernation yo, switch up, liver nation, fly information
Vivid vacation, deliberation moments
Move like '91 Romans, cloning everything
Gents only, the rent's on the stove, I'm in Rome
Maxed out, Amex style, my team brand bandits
Make a move and get blown off the planet, baby
Hold that cannon, just understand we got the whole shit
Padlocked down, my niggas won't have it




Aiyo, jumping out of Benz wagons, my family live in the Hill
They call us Bin Ladins, laughing, turbaned up
Faggot niggas get murdered up, these streets is like radio beef
So watch how the kid turn it up
Bulletproof tuxes, knuckle games is clobbering and busters
Eighteen niggas, bringing the ruckus
Flame throwers on our backs and shoulders, the rusty joints still work
The trey eight'll blow one of your dojas
When theres mad heat, he the mad calm, walk around
Gold collect, 36, so before G bomb
My inner strength flowing, I mastered Qi-Gong
Ya'll Planet of the Apes, standing next to King Kong
Forensic file, ultraviolet hype, sky blue Bals
Laying niggas like ceramic tile
I'm like Urlacher, beasting at the top of the pile
Kneeing niggas in the nuts, nigga, damn I'm foul




We blow money, got game, hungry, we pop things
Look for me, grams in my pocket, Chef cook for me
Blue Magic bundles, I'm dope, but on the humble
I'm a good dude, don't short change me, seen as a hood rule
Beer drinking, Cuban Linking, new way of thinking
Got me thinking Meth, break the handcuffs, run out the precinct
This is hard body, hard knocks, if you pushing that hard rock
Then let these niggas go off top
We rock fitted, dropkick it, I lived it and not quit it
I pithed it, my pops sniffed it, need business, I'm not finished
I'm *burns himself* too hot wit it, you bitching, the plot thicken
I'm shitting the Glock, spitting, if nigga don't stop snitching
Just what the block missing, the two-seater wit the top missing
And two divas wit they tops missing
Now that's living to me, I'm what these kids is killing to be
But I don't want my children to be






Okay, Yeah, yeah, 
Back for another one bitch, Let's do it, Ha
Staten Island stand up,(okay)
Long Island stand up, (okay)
Jersey, Yeah, Brick City nigga
Funk Doc


Yo, I'll start this rhyme with how y'all feel in this bitch
I'm finna to spit, got steel in my grip
But I ain't talkin bout guns, I'm talkin mics, niggas stealin my shit
Then try to act like they ain't feelin my shit
Now if we talkin bout ones, I'm Russell Simmons I be talkin in tongues
Fuck where you from and all the niggas you brung
Punk, My clan don't sleep son, I put that on each one
Be cool until the heat come, these pussies might eat some
Nigga this is not pop music, unless your tryna pop shots to it
Why would you have that Glock and not use it
How could you hear this joint and not lose it
You stupid, You need to shot from cupid to get love for this music
Diamond in the ruff, Like iodine, Find me in the cut
If not, probably find me in a slut, if I buy me a Dutch
That means Mef Man's back with the stuff, Lot of back talkin backin it up


Now I like bein the man, I like weed in my hands
I like my G's in advance, But y'all don't understand
Me no like, fake niggas that ain't got the game right
Me no like, when y'all killas pop shit and can't fight


Back in the zone, No backbone
He stepped on and spat on, niggas don't last long
If I don't get some act-right soon, I'm gonna act wrong
I ain't tryin to get clapped on for makin these rap songs
If you're misunderstood pimp, what would the hood think?
To know that I've been swindled, bamboozled, and hoodwinked
These rappers ain't like me, they see that there might be
More to me then some Air Force Ones and a white tee, I'm nice B
6 foot 4, Un-cut raw, pocket full of straws, I'm that nigga to look for
Want paper like a book store, ain't never been shook poor
I switch from Method Man to Candy Man and the hooked off
Still ain't nothin sweet though, Who wanna spit flows
First learn to put the weed inside the bag and then get dough, (Then get dough motherfucker)
Tell your peoples and kin folk, I been dope, Anything else is an insult. (God damn right)




So obnoxious that I'm toxic, Call that diarrhea
Spit that hot shit, cause I'm hot bitch, And got butter-fingers
Oops I drops it, load and locks it, Take the recipe thats been concocted
Got women just like a vehicle, Topless
First You see what I'm worth, Pullin paper straight out the wood work
Until I push dirt, Shit I hate to fuck up a good shirt
But damnit I'm back, I done relapsed, Shot a dose of some murder I wrote, Then lean back
I'm part Ghost, Part Cappa, RZA, And Deck
Part Dirty, Uey, GZA, Masta Killa, And Chef
But I'm all Mef, All vet, Killers I'm complex
Niggas, Have yet to blow up, Nothin but bomb threats
New York yall, Shoot or shank me, I bleed Yankee
I'm hot dog, Yall ain't nathan to put it frankly
I find excuses to finally lose it, Then write exclusive
And he like VH1, You know behind the music






Now you know you gon' respect the law
"Well, I got some shit too, nigga!"
Yeah, nigga travel far
"You respect my shit and I'll respect yours"
"You respect my shit and I'll respect yours"
"You respect my shit and I'll respect yours"


I traveled so far
I'm chewin niggas lyrics for a Mars bar
New era, bust em like reign terror
So highly mechanized, a nigga died and measured
The inevitable, beyond the ever so, this deadly technical
Scribes get revised in the time before celestial
No being or lyric ever hit precise, double sight
Take light, through the crypts at night
Spark pathetic brains and meteorite
Seven heaven verses the seven wonder, lyrics of thunder
As lightning strikes snakes out from under
Cloudy men drips, sinks Niles of fine mist
Worries startin to give, land for the tales out the crypt
Of the dark, dead senses, gods of heavenly business
Count Dracula told me how to find the eclipse
I leave your lip stitched
Cause you couldn't mind your business
But when it came to this rap
You should've vacated the premises
Make way for a chilla, guerilla, down low killa
Get loopbtin civil, next up


Yo I believe that's me
(Aiyyo P get on the mic for the NYC)


P attack you from the metronome
Catch you in your groove home alone
Blowin wit the chrome, nigga
I'm blowin to the bone
My title be known, cannibal, dynamical maestro
Sparked and fully hydroid my team of psychos
Sell it higher than the Eifel Towers
Seconds minutes led the hour, wein the power
Spittin bibles, the sunshower, the wise out on the scene
They think we forget the dream
My aura sheens like morphine in your veins
Pastors saying can you and your crew, oooh stand the rain
Many men possess the gin in the jungle of sin
Deeper than, Sunn chosen others frozen
From the explosion, my opposition
Protect my team of demolitions, full competition
Keep em drinkin Benjin
Like some chicken heads on the ground
Bite the trey pound for foes that wanna get down
Me and my clique sharpen the sound
Infiltrate the town town town


Next up (yo I believe that's me)
Aiyyo, Razah get on the mic for the NYC


If I could chew glass to this, true master shit check it
Hell Razah raise from the dead black Lazarus
Hittin ass to this on King Sols mattresses
Bust your gat to this, make sure you hold it accurate
John the Baptist this dip you wit the fish
Aladdin out the genie lamp grant you on your wish
Trapped in the studio booth and told the truth
You better try a video shoot or get the boot
From BK to Beirut we shuttin down groups
Gatherin the loot while you mackin in a chicken coop
Duck duck goose tie him in a noose
Whats the use of havin your troops if you don't put them to use?
Yall rappers couldn't blow if a windy storm produce
And sung a kiddie song and wore a Power Ranger suit
Salute the first fruit, King David birth root
Play the earths flute just before I execute
Next up


Yo I believe that's me
(Aiyyo Meth lock it down like LAPD)


While you proceed to cut the mustard, I cut the cheese
Mr. Freeze givin cold shoulders to mcs
The sickest of disease
Johnny Blaze at three hundred and sixty degrees
My PLO stees is from here to overseas
Guerillas in the mist swingin from the highest trees
Bombin enemies
See me in the global war being all that I can be
Camoflauge fatigue, hard headed major league
Got em under siege your battleship in sinkin
20,000 leagues beneath sea level
Adjust the trebel on that thang thang got your shovel
Can you dig it? Keep talkin bout it while we live it
All day, every days a Billie Holiday
Lady sings the blues get the street news by the way
Have you heard crime pay?
Hit your block like that lava that burnt Pompeii, mega hot
In the melting pot, felt the shot around the world
We unstoppable like Juggernaut baby girl
Armed and dangerous treat militia, Ill make you famous
Gama-radiated verbal going through changes




No need to adjust your system
This song  call it Jack Herer, cause a hit strong
Fist pump, Rebel on the set make your bitch jump
Doubt me? Get in line, cause the list long
Scandalous tight Nixon
'Melo in your face, like the Knicks on
Dick long, gripped in the pits with my wits on
Low quick, short wick on a lit bomb
Better strong any record Inspectah on
I transform to a beast, call me Predacon
Upper echelon, that can rap 'til he dead and gone
Was an ex-con, now I get my checks on
Now a nigga's alright, like I'm never wrong
Headstrong, stepping through a present-day Lebanon
Like Marvin, I get it on, Rebel gone set it off
Then I jet set where the weather's warm


Florida or something
(scratching)


Listen, I'm a visionary, killing this, I'm stealing this
Hang with a gang that's villainous
Building this from the ground up, turn the sound up
Lounge around, let the beat pound, like a Dillinger
The handgun, can't come close, I'm a phantom
Your brand ain't a movement and your jam ain't an anthem
Tantrum, crying bitch, if battling's your dying wish
I'm a genie, that'll grant that shit, I insist
Fly shit, shrunken little sweater, yeah we tight knit
Tight kicks, flow holy water, like Christ spit
Ice pick, swing that mother-fucker like a night stick
Prisoners, tie son up, that Iron Mike shit
Listeners, take a deep breath I mean I'm recessed
ES, mint issue one, you the re-press
Refresh your funny style, you should redress
Speak less, what's a Braveheart with a weak chest?


A knock-out blow, he's down for the count
Listen to this


I spit bomb, kill 'em softly with this song
Clique strong, this ain't nothing like a chick song
Big John, in the shower with a big blonde
Switch on the power, little sour in the big bong
I'm big, homes, y'all ain't living 'til you live long
Big-boned honey, trying to keep me in the friend zone
I touch down, try and put it in her end-zone
Pimp on, then I dip on her like I'm Jim Jones
Yes y'all heard the rest, who the best, y'all?
You slept off, I'm a threat, what you rep, dog?
Respect, dog, here's a bone: go and fetch, dog
Mr. Method, my favourite letter is "F", y'all(Ha!)
As I continue where we left off
Next off the list, another hater is checked off
Get lost you trick, check boss, or bet's off
More music and less talk, I'm talking about


I walk down the street people look at me and say, "Who the hell are you?", I'm just an average Joe


Dr Yorgo, the EQ on this will make Czarface's brain bleed. He'll become so enraged, he'll self destruct.(cackles)

Don't be so foolish, you oaf! I knew Suckface would be stupid enough to surface again

Sir, it's Czar and they love him, because he's a hero

Well, every hero needs a villain




 Yeah, now that I got the blood, let me speak on this aight
 Yeah, I hear a lot of kick in this bitch
 Turn the music up in this motherfucker
 Other side of the track niggas
 Method Man, Redman, IAM
 Let's get it dirty
 Yeah, we back live again
 It's the world wide niggas


Ladies and germs, it's pandemonium, brick Napoleon
Doc and Meth, all in ya girl falopian
Fuck you up, like a double-stacked Pokemon
Peek-at-you/Pikachu, your a puss (?Dat lowly man?)
I'm from the brick, where there's real car thieves
Rock this funky joint, like P.R.P.'s
Tricks up my sleeve, just give me an hour
I bang two women, on the Eifel Tower


Mes dits saignent, y'a tempte, voici un son d'compet'
Pour l'occas', Rh, on ramne sur la poudrire l'allumette
Celle qui rgnre, la base, et les crimes qu'on n'a pu commettre
Sur disque pour la peine v'l 5 comtes


D'entre le team occupe le ring comme Ali
Dj a plit sentant le pril proche le cur
Kaki la plume faon coup de pioche phalange active
Place la droite en sortie de rotative, ressent la force vive
L'nergie de ce son o on svit  vie
C'est le chant que nos tripes entonnent comme un choc lectrique
Chaque phrase touche gotrip ou mtaphorique
Blast les blass sur actif puissant submersible
Vise l'esprit fier irascible, IAM irrductible




 Ds le dpart, faut que tu comprennes
 Understand that Redman got a gun
And when I cock it back, FIRE, I am, somebody
 Roll up, or we throw up drinks, until we throw up
 Aiyyo, right off the back, I want y'all to know
 Que c'tquipe secoue le ttes, y'a le fire dans le show
 I am, somebody
 Sens l'atmosphre, la haute sphre, la sale rime Rh


Yo, the bigger they are, the harder they fall
I got some con's, that love songs, harder than y'all
I don't fear nothin' at all, frontin' at all
I even got female cops, bustin' my balls
Don't mess with my mess, my disc in effect
Like the clip in the Tech, ya riskin' ya neck
If ya fixin' to flex, come wit ya best
Or don't come, name a track I don't run


J'dbarque sec  la Starsky C'est la guerre
(Massive!) T'sais que c'est parti, esprit de panthre
Sige dans mes dits d'artiste, sans comdie ni mdire
J'connais c'biz estampill, mec averti qui mdite


Tu reconnais le son, tu veux ta part ? N'essaie mme pas
On sort cru jusqu'au sang surpuissant
Faut que tu sentes l'aisance rimes et assonance
Fait l'effort, capte le sens des textes  l'essence
Le crew frappe grave ds sa naissance


Eh! Mets tes mitaines, tes mythes aiment, quand t'imites pas, limite pas man
Chacun son combat ici l'beat mne
Donc v'l, on s'amne Et les cous' crient "Amen"
Allez sonner l'gong, qu'on sert les gamelles
V'l du noble art, nos bars, nos pars, briseur d'bobards
Sur sol fixe et loin du gotha
Sur son lev aux pres Labat, cr pour abattre
Chaque mesure qui s'prsente, mme si on doit m'abattre






I'm a animal, a real wise guy
I don't talk, I let me boom bye, bye
I shut down the clubs, and I hit the Ave
DOC-TOR, fix a hole, like fix a flag
SHEAH!, they yellin' out "He ain't shit!"
Believe that, when I act like my weed ain't hit
Def Jam, Vandetta, Jam Jay, forever
Rock an umbrella, when I spit, nigga


Plutt warrior comme Holy Field, ma posie prolifique
Base mes origines au rap qui horrifie
La masse qui crache des orifices
La haine de l'habit comme on hait l'uniforme
Pas l'homme et la forme de nos rimes horripilent
Le poids des maux tue les clavicules
Et les choix que l'Etat vhicule
En laisse au rgime, c'est la rage et l'cume
Les traces du vcu sont les traces qu'on inflige au Ridim
Terrorise comme les PSY 4  coup d'crime auditif


I'm rocking the fame, I'm hard-headed, my nuts the same
I'm bringing dope back in the game, tap ya fame
And get a fix, y'all ain't really seen bomb shit
Even if you got Inspectah Deck, or Huns Blix
Meth Man, Funk Doc, and IAM
Got these half naked, Hollywood hoes, on spy cams
Y'all know the program, get wit the program

On the same level

Please, no more pain
That's right nigga
Hey drop that shit boy


My adversaries cry like hoes fully eradicate my foes
My lyrics explode on contact, gamin' you hoes

Say my name, watch bitches come
Now fire when ready, stay watchin' our figure
Increase speed, make you motherfuckers bleed from your mouth quicker
Plus all these niggas that you run with, be on some dumb shit
Trickin' on hoes, I ain't the one bitch
Holla my name and witness game official, it's so sick
Have every single bitch that came witchu, on my dick
Plus this alcohol increases the chance to be deceased
I'm movin' you stupid bitches, vicious telekinesis
Am I reachin' your brain? Nigga how can I explain?
How vicious this Thug motherfucker came
When I die, I want to be a living legend, say my name
Affiliated with this motherfuckin' game, with no more pain

I dare you niggas to open fire, I'll murder that ass
And disappear before the, cops come runnin'
My Glock's spittin' rounds, niggas fallin' down clutchin' they stomach
It's Westside, Death Row, Thug niggas on the rise
Busters shot me five times, real niggas don't die
Can ya hear me?, laced with this game, I know you fear me
Spit the secret to war, so cowards fear me
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Heart of a solider with a brain to teach your whole nation
And feelin' no more pain

Freaky bitch, come give me kiss
Tell them niggas from other areas, brothers from here
So obsessed with this money makin' it ain't nothin' we fear
Now they label me a troublemaker, cause I'm a ridah
Death to you playa haters, don't let me find ya
Mama made me rugged, Baptize the public
Now you all thugs, nigga don't you love it
It's similar to multiple gunshots, retaliation is a must
Wasn't too sure what you facin' so watch the guns bust
You niggas'll bleed, fuckin' with me you'll be deceased
Never restin' in peace, nigga
With no more pain

This year you motherfuckers gonna be dust
Thug Life nigga Westsiiide!

Ass and tits fat with the juicy lips
Mami let me holla at you for a few ticks
Get to know your name while you light some spliffs
Let me get inside your mind for some major shit
Let me put you on to some old gangsta shit (gangsta shit)
I step up in the club so fresh and so clean clean (clean clean)
Maxout, and Mafia the american dream team (dream team)
Big free rollin' on dubs with the bling bling
When it comes to stuntin' for it shit ain't no thang thang
Niggas ain't slackin' niggas just packin'
Bet you don't want to see the G-U-N-C'S
Shit is off the hook, ma please believe it
Move +Dem Thangs+ Like +Angie Martinez+ (for my gangstas)

[Chorus/Talkbox)
Let's keep it rockin'
We got the cris', let's get it poppin'
We got haaaze, let's get the smokin', ??? on somethin'
Cause I don't see nothin' wrong (no I don't baby)
With smokin', bustin', fuckin' hoes all night long


Hey Mami
Peace to all my fly hunnies
To all my niggas gettin' money
To all my real gangstas sittin' on 20's
Lace your pinky, your wrist your neck full of jewelery
Live your life to the fullest if you feel me, bitch
Shake it to the left, shake it to the right
I put my dick in a hoe every single night (every single night)
What more can I say I can show you the best tell it
I +Get My Freak On+ way more than +Missy Elliot+
And if you think somethin' sweet
We do like uncle L and swing a F through your jeep
Ass like trina (take it to the house)
Freak like adina (take it in your mouth)
Cause if you ain't up on thangs
Bang bang be the name J-M-C's the gang
I rep M-A-X, O-U-T
Blaze hoes from N-Y, cali to south beach (to all my gangstas)

 - 2X
Let's keep it rockin'
We got the cris', let's get it poppin'
We got haaaze, let's get the smokin', ??? on somethin'
Cause I don't see nothin' wrong (no I don't baby)

It's the mafia, you know there ain't nothin' wrong
Baby you know there ain't nothin' wrong
You know there ain't nothin' wrong
I want to fuck you all night long, stop it baby

Cherish every moment of his love before you perish
Bitch, chicka chicka chich, watch me switch
Lookin for a bird, I can hitch, into your atmosphere
Take your pussy out like a pap smear
Make you smile, at the same time crack a tear
Smack ya rear, vagina saliva, Trojan wear, rough rider

Taste the apple cider, you become strong, then become a ?prider?

To the midnight, butt naked wit a knife
Ask my alien likes, I've been crazy all my life
Hardtime homicide, time flys, do or die
Crooked ass and crooked eye, scripture from the darkside
Johnny 5, I reside, in the killa bee hive
Only the strong gon' survive
From the depths of the killa to the top, we're now born

(instrumental)




I would kill some fucking body
The mad stola, the mad stola
(Who? Russel who?)
Ha ha, nah let me stop
Word up this is a Def Jam production (Sandman)
Featuring, Johnny Blaze word up
Another Sandman joint, dirtman on the track
Flip the script, script the flip
Check the steez (believe that)
Check it out now, check it check it out


I get drunk off of cheap wine and hold frontline
Niggas wanna front, fine, fuck with me and mine
Rain on your sunshine
Swine niggas come as hard as a pork rind
Can you dig it, only five percent live it
While the rest of you fake niggas try to get it
Peep the Stallion, half of y'all need to quit it
Frontin' hard and be soft as a cotton knitted
No balls at all, if you do son then get with it
Razor sharp in my jaw bone I might spit
I'm dealin with it on a everyday basis
Roam where it get cold at and stack glaciers
In the zone it's Tical once again stoned
Throw your hands in the air and puff a Meth bone
Did you ever get the feeling for that phat shit?
Something different from that R&B and rap shit?
Well here it come, from the gums of the one, I amaze 'em
Fire in the sky, peep me now, Johnny Blaze 'em, check it
My mind's on the rhyme, ain't a damn thing funny
Gettin' money, Blaze represent, kills the fraudulent
Fucker giving me the grill
Nowadays everybody trying to keep it real
4th Disciple, hit me with that 30/30 rifle
Beats from the streets mega-trifle
Rap gymnastics, flipping from the cradle to the casket
Take another pull, fantastic
It's the Method not the Plastic, Man
Coming down like hourglass sand, check the tactic
Flow P.L.O., P.L.O. now you know
The ultimate and rhyme legitting
Peep the counterfeitten or get snake bitten
Filled up with deadly venom, Johnny Blaze get up in 'em
Play 'em out like Lee denim, can you dig it
Can a brother eat, can I live it
Gets no deeper, whoever slipping get the sleeper
Hold, faces of death, bodies cold
On some Evil Dead part 2, swallow your soul
Yeah, and it don't stop
The body body body body rock, yeah
Hip hop, we sat out in the dark (in the dark)
We used to do it out in the park (Where that?)
Hill Avenue, ain't a damn thing new
Stay true to my Clan, I'm a family man
Loyalty brought me royalties
To the Gods I give my heart and soul totally
It's a bond can't be broken, that's my life
I'mma die if I think twice, I'm not jokin
To the essence if I'm half stepping
Politician use the system, as lethal weapons
When we slip up, lethal injection
Hah, everyday life's a lesson
I take my spot in the lower class section


Johnny Blaze, 9-5 to the 9-6
Word up, keep it moving



(Ol Dirty Bastard is doing a Martin Lawrence comedy skit from Raw)
(this is going on in the background during the Intro and part
Of the first verse)

You know God damn well I don't smoke this shit Meth
 Know damn well I don't smoke this sheyit
Know damn well!
I remember when we used to go down to the creek
Member when we used to go down to the creek?
And used to dip your head in the water?
Everybody thought you had it in you, you know
You used to jump out the water
The water used to glisten alllllll over your bohhhhhhdy
What? I said the water used to glisten alllllll over your bohhhhhhdy



Clean out my vocals
Yeah, I said YEAH
I said zuckazuhzuhzuh, zuckazuhzuh

Chkccha ckchcka Brooklyn, zucka Zoo
C'mon baby baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, c'mon!



Superlogical this, superlogical that
I detect a nigga dialect by the way he rap
I elect myself President MC
My career so intelligent, unique physique
Then with mathematics, not democratic
Static, topic, Asiatic
Zssshuh, them unique, never leak, brlaharl...
Bring it on back

Superlogical this, superlogical that
I detect your dialect by the way you rappp!
I elect myself President MC
My career so intelligent, unique physique
Doin mathematics and I'm not democratci
No static, topic, I'm Asiatic
See, I'm Unique, never... blarhalal...



Crazy, lurkin in the shadows, I'm shady, sheisty
Get your weight up, don't take me lightly
Blasted, dirty to the grain I be stained with the madness
It's the Meth-Tical with the Bastard

MZA MZA my name is the Ol Dirty Bas
My gammmmme, to kick your ass
Dnnah duh dnnh dnnh duh duh!
Dnnah dnh duh duh duh dahhhhhh!

Flip and relax, take an Ex-Lax, I'm shittin
On the industry that was frontin now they missin
What everybody else is gettin
Cuz they wasn't representin the real...

...appeal, like me and, old time
When it comes to the microphone who killed the swine?
Be the original G
Do the rhymin on time and in the place to be



You are now in my trance
You are getting sleeeeeepyyyyyy
You are now getting sleeeepyyyyy
And sleeeeppieeerrrrr
And sleepy, and sleepy



This one here's for my people, my people
Enter the 36 chambers, the sequel
Part two, for me and the cipher troop
With the Teflon lyrics that you can't get through
With the twenty-two automatic rap you pack, what?
You ain't hittin with that wack shit you kickin
Straight from the beginning, of the game
All the way to the ninth inning, I bring the pain
Dark like the midnight train on the track by the RZA
Diesel like Arnold Schwarzanegger



The hardware, choose the hardware
Ask you a question, test the Ason
Extra extra, read the drama and thennn another one
Which you intrigue, do your rap fatigue in the...
Ohhhh....
Here I go, aauhhh
Yeahhh...
(shit that makes me high)




Listen, you might learn some
Jahlil Beats, holla at me
Jadakiss where you been, where you at
This rap is wack
I want that old thing back
I want that old thing back


Some niggas tell a lot, some niggas sell a lot
Some niggas used to be mad nice, then fell a lot
Albums still trash I dont care who the hell you got
Portraying the role of a G, we can tell you not
Sorry to bother you, I'm only doing what a father do
Your production is horrible, youll forever be a nerd
And your metaphors are better off, never being heard
I came in grimy, Puff made me shiny
Put 'em both together, a protege of the 90's
Grew up, put that bullshit behind me
Started making niggas demises untimely
Looking for me, come to the hood you could find me
Gucci belt right on the waist where the 9 be
.38 right in the garbage, where the packs at
M1 right in the trunk, where the jacks at
Whoever is in arm's length will get backslapped
Cause I ain't playing with these rap cats
This is the flow you can't learn
The dutch you can't burn
Nigga, I've got stripes you can't earn


Method Man, where you been where you at
These rap niggas is wack, I want that old thang back
Yeah, I want that old thang back
Yeah, I want that old thang back


You got the M.E, the M.E., the M.E., the M., M., M.,
The M.E.T.H.O.D. Man
You need a dopefiend track
Let me shoot up and lean back
With this needle stuck in my arm, never tuck in my charm
Most my team sling crack
If I hit every corner with G packs
Might cause the man DC to relapse
I'm a Hip hop juggie, who needs rap?
MC's wack, Killerbees is back in the booth
Mind your beeswax
And fuck a salary cap
We blow a cap at any Energizer bunny right where his battery at
Look, the bastard child of Clarence Thomas and Reagonomics
On every 1st and 15th make sure you pay me homage
Might break a promise but never breaking the code
Got the floor safe, coke in the pot, fiend at the stove
Meth, rock a W on my clothes
I'm a straight rider, straight to the W with these hoes
I'm straight fire, these motherfuckers is froze
Like a skinny supermodel that like to powder her nose


Redman, where you been where you at
These rap niggas is wack, I want that old thang back
I want that old thang back
I want that old thang back


Yo boy, I'm like Rick James, I got that old thang
I got a gold chain,  with gold frames
Doc doing the runnerman on Soul Train
With a chinese girl, the chick can get Lo Mein
Propane for the raw, I put on the streets
My thoughts, the blue magic put on the beats
Game time, Doc rocket like Dominique
Play vegetarian nigga and ignore the beef
Yeah, Kyrie keep the blow smoking
Slide in the club, cool like the floor frozen
Check out the wild thang got a Tone Lco
Big ass and high heels with the toes open
That's me, 90's MC
Fuck a Grammy awards, underground is tax free
Look in the mirror I feel fantastic
The mirror said 'you are, you conceited bastard'


Santana, where you been where you
These rap niggas is wack, I want that old thang back
I want that old thang back
Tell 'em I want that old thang back


I came to bring the pain
Put niggas to shame, simple and plain
They gon' remember my name
And it's all for respect not fame
So don't play with me
You could give 'em rope, they still can't hang with me
Pass the baton, they still can't race with me
So far ahead of these niggas they still chasing me
I wouldn't be surprised if niggas ghostwriters got ghostwriters
Nothing cease to amaze you
Labels used to care, even though they was raping me
Now it's 360 deals, modern day slavery
Fuck you, who payin' me, I'm the one recording
We'll settle for extortion or fame over fortune
The game done changed, the sound done changed
All these niggas sound the same
The word loyalty don't even sound the same
Good thing I keep the pound, when it bang it always sound the same
I aim at the game, the real shall remain
Neck full of water like I drowned my chain
Flier than a nigga jumping out the plane
Higher than you niggas, you can't find the strain
Better than you niggas that's without me saying
Treat the money like the work, we don't count, we weigh it
For this amount we aim it, blaze it, flame it
Barrel big as a shower head, you don't want me spraying
Enough with the mumble jumble
Santana back though, can I get a drum roll?
Whole lotta kush and it's stuffed in a fronto
Fiends still say my work taste like gumbo
Yeah, bring that old thang back
I was told to whip it up and bring the whole thang back
When I was pumping coke, you was jumping rope
I was runnin' out of bags, you was playing tag
While you was hop scotching, I was drop shopping
At the dealer paying cash for them paper tags
While you was pop locking, I was Glock popping
Getting to the cash, brown paper bags
Blowing money fast and it never last
Yeah, they make it fast, barely make it back
Haters gonna suffer, I'm okay with that
All this garbage, time to throw away the trash




Can't match my style and interest I got rich thoughts and a violent instinct
That's just how I distinguish the bad from the good and the smart and ignant
Straight rock dude bar my pigment
I'm blending the new wave with the vintage
I'm a prototype, you's a mark up
I start this shit like a fuckin' aardvark
Since the government seems to mark us
I try to stay hidden in a green apartment
Working tryna be an artist
Control all minds when they hear me talking
Got a problem with authority
But the neighbourhood cops love R D G L D G R N
40 niggas nearly died last week
So I count is as a win any day I breathe


So long as that systems only true motive is profit interest and not the maintenance and betterment of the population, to meeting human needs, then that society should not stand; it should be challenged and questioned and overthrown


Fact is that I won't be voting' till the poverty gap has slim proportions
Foolish just like the notion of marching for peace while they making corpses
Kids dumb from the lack of schooling I don't blame them 'cause the shit is boring
Found out I had a knack for touring so I make ways from VA to Zurich
Bang bang and flee, she watched her Grandson die at a jamboree
You don't know?

You want what?



(Smoke that shit)
(Red, Gold, and Green nigga)
Meth Man not one to 
My team break bad, I'm a walking psycho
No net needed when I walk a tightrope, no typo
You a lightweight, no lipo
Light work, getting lit, no light show

IG, I don't do it for likes though
And Snow white, don't be killing my high hoe
Hi-ho we can kill it like KYBO
Here's a middle finger to 5-0
I flow, smoking that hydro, survivo

Put the gun in your pie-hole
I go harder than Pablo these narcos are in my cheddar
But this kinda cheese is not yours
Killer Bees we got soul



Now I can't strengthen economies
Or make sure that the water that we drink is clean
I can't stop fights in the Middle East
Can never make sure that the whole world eats
Military unit will never retreat
Chicago schools  gonna still have beef
Palestinian and you're missing your kids
Stay fighting for the Gaza Strip
I can put my words together like this
The words that I say just won't change shit
Hospital rooms still gonna have patients
Blacks in the womb still gonna deal with racists
Ain't bomb did I ever defuse
From doing no harm that the terrorist choose
Only thing that I know I can do is die like the motherfuckers want me to




No matter how hard the times may seem
Don't give up our plans
Don't give up our dreams
No broken bridges can turn us around
Cause what we're searching for
Will soon be found


Hey yo listen here shortcake Camay glow
You know we both make angels when we lay in the snow
Heat the house with the oven when the chips got low
Because Tony can't be out there pushing that blow
We made plans and dreams, not grands and schemes
I want to search for the meaning of love, see what it means
Because we hustle so hard, cross so many bridges
Made babies, took trips to the mall for family pictures
And our souls is magnetic, we the meaning of destiny
Be that banker of trust that looks to invest in me
Together, to get her, means for me to get you
We back, reunite like the Wu
See we soulmates, we melt like cookies and cream
And I fiend for the days and the nights to sex my queen
So no matter how hard it seems, dreams come true
Keep Allah in the heart, hugs and kisses
Tony Starks




Still applying the pain
The purple frying my brain, this woman crying again
She tired of fighting, my feelings likely the same
Thats what happens when you wife them they try and tighten the chain
See, she in the right so I put her right in her lane
I'm all night with the pipe I can feel her biting my chain
She got her own I ain't got to buy her a thing
I be burning up the sheets every time I'm lighting the Jane
We go together like Martin and Gina
But she get uptight want to fight like Ike and Tina
So love her or leave her alone like I don't need her though
A minute later I'm back like I ain't mean it yo
We break up just to make up
She fly without the makeup
Together we upgrade to A+
So all this bickering ain't us, we bigger than that
You only cool when I'm digging your back
Now fall back baby




Shorty with the flavor like Breyers
Real sweet with your thick legs
Look like you drink eggs, you lying
Now you met a Teflon don
Stay high, Levi's on
YSL frames no games
I'm into cash man, getting this paper
Buying up acres
Ride around and yo fuck with my neighbours
Pocket full of hundreds and weed
Light the Philly cigar up
And go dolo, ride through SoHo
Ya that little baby in the back
That's the sound of sweet life
A sweet wiz will make you a sweet knight
Chill with the pawns, we on
Because life is a chess board
You better have your sword and vest on
Never hate your enemies because it affects judgement
They only hate it if they know you getting hella cheese
That's what it is, what it do for you?
Don't let the truth bore you
Word up, don't let the youth spoil






A-yo, everybody get the fuck out! Right now!
The Meth Lab is closed, Crystal Meth coming soon!
Shout out 3rd Digala




Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yeah, yo, yeah, yo


Catch me on yo' brochure with beachballs, at least three whores
Head wop Queens know how to work they jaws
They skintone is coffee and milk, mixed up
Ass as big as my boss' wife, stomach ripped up
Spitting liquor in they mouth, cold Moet
Captain Morgan, taking flicks, posing, holding my tech
With cowboy hats and coach bags, they party like rockstars
Bo Gary watches, just chill, they down in the shark bars
And me, gunslinger, clips, cock D
My fashion on, I'm rocking 'em new Rasheeds
I'mma finish ya, go in brother like Mr. Cee
You could find me fucked up like the mice in cheese
Life's a B, Bentley and big bills
Bottles, biscuits, bitches, blunts, bad boys bodying pit bulls
Karate, black belt and I bring booze
To big bar brawls, ball games blasting, fuck 'til my balls blue


We like the black Yankees, old vets who sit in the rest
Thankful, counting up currency and move when it rain, pour
From every bitch that we bless, we hit up, automatic love
The Cuban Link niggas is the realest
My wallet walk, speak to niggas, cops, judges
We put it down, Columbian style, with three killas
Based on money, dummies'll die
It ain't funny, trying to front on mine, we get in ya mommy
Keep cool, nigga, read him the rules, before he bleeding in pools
And fuck my shit up, and I'mma just lose
Paid a lot of paper to live here
American Gangster status, Big Brother, lemme get in ya ear
You know what time it is, crime it is
No matter what rhyme it is
We gon' stay fly, hit lye, rock diamond shits (no question)
Based on a general's fist of fury
Neck, arm, money, all of that's crispy jewelry


Let me show you how I g ride, nina on both sides
Nobody riding shotgun but the four-five
Nigga, if you won't try, I'll give ya something to regret
Throw that mothafucking semi to ya neck
Throw the other black Jimmy to ya chest
If you budge, you get stretched, nothing more, nothing less
Pay respect, I'm a element of Homicide Housing
In other words, bitch, I'm the resident from Homicide Housing
Known for drug dealing, stack thousands
Four hundred grand in the couches, two hundred grand on the houses
At any time I could move up out this
And go and cop some shit up in the moutains


Aiyo, aiyo, you know ya boy stay fresher than produce
Timberland snow boots, collecting more CREAM than a toll booth
I grind daily, Patriotic like Tom Brady
I'm the bomb baby, cuz what I write is beyond crazy
I'm the Don with the teflon armor, good karma, mac palmer
Call me Arab Diesel cuz I'm a track bomber
Roger that, my niggas ain't got it cracked
All we do is dollar stack, get twisted like bottlecaps
While you on the block getting indicted
We island hopping, globe trotting through the friendly skies flying United
There's a party over here and everybody's invited
The headliners is Theodore and everybody's excited


Fuck that, 'bout time we took it back to the block
The task force coming, I got crack in my sock
White Rock on the dinner plate, get cash, shit is hot
Smash whips on the Interstate, we dash on the cops
It's them dudes, drug slingers, 1-6-Ooh
Crime figure, rhyme spitter, his gun spit too
Call 'em Sex Pistols, ravishing, nigga, I'm Rick Rude
And ain't many mothafuckas could fit up in Rick's shoes
Man, listen, ice glisten, they love the life we living
That's a given, like football players love white women
White linen, a tight denim, that ass look right in 'em
Shit, I'm riding 'em, cool as Kahlua's with ice in 'em, shit...

 + (Cappadonna)
Aiyo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo I pass the mic to Cap (Nah, I pass it back)
Never, son, hold that, you the master of the rap attack
So knick knack patty wack (This is how we do it black)
(Slap you with the almanac) Where actual facts is sold as facts


We on our grown man shit like Quincy Jones
Travelling across the world while we smoking the bone
We grinding, y'all niggas know what we do
We get it in with the Murderland, Chi-town too
Hit you up, something nice 'til the death of Yakub
Swagger stuck on ya face like a New Jack tool
Right back at you, yeah me and my dude Toney
We don't fuck with fake contracts and niggas that's phony
Trying to get this money, right homey
And lay back in the Riverside, just chill, relax the domepiece
Link up with a fly dime, brick and a chrome piece
Coming for that gwop, yeah nigga, you got beef

{*skit of Ghostface and co. speaking during concert follows*}






Money ain't a thing if I got it
Mo-mo-money ain't a thing if I got it
Money


Before the money, there was love
But before the money, it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough


Yo, sitting back plotting, jotting information on my nation
Really started from the bottom, boy cotton
But they still planting plantations, we keep buying in
Closed-minded men
Pride is higher than the prices on your Pradas and Balenciagas Balance my saga with the Henny agua
Me and my niggas tryna eat, you pussies empanada
The flow like plenty lava
With just a penny I could multiply my worth
And make you work for me for twenty hours
I swear these niggas love to copy, thanks for listening
The kid ain't been the same
Since Biggie smacked me at my christening
Watch what you dishing and please play it safe
Cause your position on the top is switching right in front your face
Rock you outta space with rhymes, I'm bustin' out
Keep ducking down, got some missiles now, headed for your house
So put the pistols down, got that red dot on your nose
Who booked the clown? I lock jaws like a blue nose
Foes keep your mouth closed or you can see the solar
I got connections that guaranteed to see closed doors
You hear that underground sonar
The way I flows then switch them
The Pros been on a mission
Listen, enter the chamber, get hyperbolic
They raisin' Macs, I raise steaks to keep them brolic
My visions is macrocosmic, pass the chronic
The mastered sonics is light years above your conscious
You're novice, but I got notes that strike nerves
I promise your minds ain't sharp like my swords
So cut the BS, and don't worry where my jeans is
And PS: Your bitch a genius, learned from my penis
I got dreams selling arenas and breaking brackets
Tenants racket, while I'm cracking a Serena
God damn, God bless the heaven that sent you
But now I'm breezing out, baby, cause my rent's due


Shit is really real out here
I said shit is really real out here (It ain't  easy)
Just trying to get a deal out here
(Money ain't a thing if I got it)
Yo, I'm screaming cream, who fucking with the rap supreme?
Joey Bad and Big Preem came to collect the green
I got a dollar and a dream, know what I mean?
And I gotta get my mama off the scene
Yo, I'm screaming cream, who fucking with the rap supreme?
Joey Bad and Big Preem came to collect the green
I got a dollar and a dream, know what I mean?
And I gotta get my mama off the scene (Joey Badass)
Cause cash ruined everything around me
Cash ruined everything around me
Cash ruined everything around me
(Wont sign to no major if no wager) (money ain't a thing)
They say money is the root of all evil
I see money as the route of all people
Cause we all follow paper trails, paper trails
And everybody gotta pay their bills, pay their bills (It ain't easy)
They say money is the root of all evil
I see money as the route of all people
Cause we all follow paper trails, paper trails
And everybody gotta pay their bills, pay their bills
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all


Before the money, there was love
But before the money, it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough



(Funky! Stand off..)


Oh shit, 3-2-1, blown to bits
Step inside the nightclub like I own the bitch
Southpaw two left feet set to trip
On that bullshit, back it up with extra clip
Man listen, pissin in the same pot I'm pissin
You're goin down, get in that plane crash position
Turbulence ahead, boy you must be sick in the head
Go get Excederin, or get intelligent
Recognize a veteran, player stay wetter than
The thug type, up mo' late nights than Letterman
Ask Teddy, Wreckx-n-Effect I'm ready
The same way I was in that bar scene in "Belly"
(Say what?) I freak the flow that let you know I'm a flower
Yo' ass is grass and I'm a lawn mower
So uhh, go ahead pass the doja
It's the return of Tical, party over


Y'all niggas wanna get down? (fuck with me)
Y'all still wanna be round? (fuck with me)
Y'all really want the street now? (fuck with me)
Y'all niggas gon' see now (party and bullshit)

You chicks, bounce to the music
Shake that ass like you bout to use it
Wanna fuck with a baller? You choose
Wanna fuck with a scrub? You lose
Fuck that, let's keep it movin
Talk about how this beat got you groovin
Nod your head, make you shake your dreads
Bass travel down the spine, get stuck in your legs
Dance 'til you rip the soles off your Timbs
Shit - knock the chrome straight off your rims
Hit - after hit, well get who you wanna get
Ain't nobody really fuckin with us
Haters try to tell me I'mma suffer for this
Hatin on me cause I mastered this
You asked for this, come here and get a glass of this
.. party and bullshit


Y'all niggas wanna get down? (fuck with me)
Y'all still wanna be round? (fuck with me)

Yo, the whole base of this is party and bullshit
Y'all lil' cats, we ain't on no cool shit
Y'all lil' dogs better learn some new tricks
And you video directors better find some new chicks
Watch this, man I got this, Hot Nikks
Mean gob spit when I talk wear galoshes
Wu-Tang Clan in the house and ain't leavin
How my Killer Bee clique feel this evening?
Meth; guerilla serial killer for scrilla
See the God run through your block like Godzilla
Menage-a-tois for these french vanillas, I'm iller
Hard as armadillo and coat made of chinchilla
New stuff, bang this, bust this, bruise this
And ballers ain't fuckin with Staten Isle, New York
What? Still in the game, platinum plus
Y'all might fuck with them, but y'all can't fuck with us


Y'all niggas wanna get down? (fuck with me)
Y'all still wanna be round? (fuck with me)
Y'all really want the street now? (fuck with me)

Intro: club bouncer

Aww shit... not these niggas again!
Aiyyo listen!
I'm only lettin five of you motherfuckers in here tonight
If your man ain't on the guest list
He get to the BACJ of the fuckin line
And you know another motherfuckin thing?
I don't give a fuck if a bitch spill a drink
In this motherfucker tonight
I'm kickin ALL y'all the fuck outta here


Uhh
Muh'fuckers be up in the club scared to fuckin death
Nigga if you scared why don't yo' ass just stay the fuck home
Check it out uhh

Me and mines at the door, ain't tryin to pay your fees
Stop playin, you fuckin with me, I push my way in
Bum rush there's plenty of us to tear the club up
Guzzlin Bacardi and such, I split a Dutch
Bouncin nigga lookin like he want war
Now I ain't the one you got to front Pah
Pattin me down like the law
As I stumble in the party
Topsey off the Limon Bacardi for sure
Loungin near the bar section, rolled the L
And kept steppin, concealed weapon, razor sharp
Blue star hatchet, in the sleeve of my jacket
Who that kid, on the dance floor lookin for matches?
Burn somethin, one toke got me blasted
Took another toke then I passed it, choke!
Fantastic, herb ain't no joke
Especially that indo smoke mixed with hashish
Ladies on the dance floor, shakin they asses
Got millon dollar broke niggas, that makin passes
Honey with the eye glasses, body work is Boombastic
Skin like blackberry molasses, mmmmm
At last it's, time to step and make her mine
Niggas headin toward the bathroom tuckin they shines
Brothers got to keep it movin, playin with kids
That won't hesitate to snatch a Cuban
You know what this is...

("Yo Duke that's your diamonds right there God?
Yo that shit'll go RIGHT where my people ain't right now.."
"Yo don't touch my shit!")

Now it's on in the lavatory, I heard a scream
End of story couldn't find shorty, party scene's
Now a fucked up chaotic thing, won't be long
Before the sirens intervene, the terrotory
Can't we all get along, without the ruckus
Got big bouncin muh'fuckers, tryin to rush us
I can take a hint, what? Can smell the stench
Of a hell bent environment, the odds against us
Back to the wall y'all, refuse to fall
All hands on deck yes, prepare to brawl
Uhh, every time I try to have a good time why?
Somebody always fuckin it up, killin my high, damn
Monkey wrench they whole program, party over
By that time I'm dead sober
In the midst of this whole shit fo' soldiers, dead gone
You can tell that they was heat holders
Everybody hit the deck when they expose tech, I fled the set
Bitch slipped and caught a broke neck, some Brooklyn kids
Rushed the coat check, they whole set, stompin Duke
Half to death and took his Rolex, it's horrible
Like a front page article, Mister Pitiful
About a step away now we critical, uhh
As I boned out I heard the people shout
NIGGAZ, yea cold turn the party out!
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

( sirens )




First, they dropped the bomb
Then came the disease, then death
This our world, your world, my world
I like this world!


On foreign land keep your toast up, hot rocks
Catch a close up, your snot box broke up
Land shark tryna post up, reptiles
Tryna throw cub with crooked smiles
Take your kindness for weakness, they foul
New York niggas be loving how the gun talk, "Pow!"
Another underboss pull a doublecross
Niggas ain't ready for the holocaust here and now
Want them games people play, catch these bullets over Broadway
25 to life up in Rahway get caught
Look deep into the black thought
A holy war is being fought on Allah's court
My perfect world (if you will!)


Mr. Sandman bring 'em a dream
Infrared light beams, homicide scene, perfect world
By any means get cream
Just don't let it come between you and I, seen
Everything is everything in this three ringed circus
Peoples is swift, tryna work us Lord
With Devil worship and satanic verses
It takes place in the world perfect, mine and yours


Heard when it rains, it pour
I came to bring the pain once more
Pedal to the floor peep the Jim Crow Law
The Big Apple rotten to the core, these niggas want war?
(Give 'em war)
They scheming and eye-beaming
Hitmen like Crying Freeman, they need cleaning
Keep it coming 'til they all running, screaming
Bloody murder at war with them inner demons, it's going down
Invasion USA, spitting rounds
If these shells hit the battleground
Pave the way for birth of a Generation X
Spoken with a project dialect
Bomb threat to the airwaves, hit the deck
Pressed for time in a world lacking sunshine
Got love for my family cause they mine
See niggas dying in the streets over petty crime
We gon' eat or die trying, got my mind made up
Young buck, just don't give a fuck
Pressing they luck when they best best to give it up
Perfect world, baby, what? Nigga head or gut, them or us
Welcome to the dark ages
Dirty pages of filth, fine filth flavors
Dust to dust and ashes to ashes
Life flashes right before his eyes, then he passes


While the 666 got more tricks than the PD's got bricks
From Bloods and Crips to pimps with mints
We still licking the scars from whips on slave ships




The children are the future
And Wu-Tang is for the babies!







Ha, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
One time, yo
Never liked son from day one, bring you tool
That nigga stick you and play dumb, hate a bitch-ass
Who care where you came from, you ain't prepared
For when the pain come, this nigga's scared, shook to death
From a cold stare, stunnin', knowin' my brothers fiend
To do you somethin' over here, we head huntin'
In the function I smell fear, adrenaline start pumpin'
I smash pumpkins, hard rock be in the cafe
Tear the club up, and anyone that try to judge us
The last days, makin' sure I get the last say
In the food chain, is you predator or prey?
If you featherweight, lyrics blow your back
Crack your vertebrae, lookin' for a better way
To get my point across, thoughts accelerate at the same speed
Of the murder rate, Lord, never perpetrate a fraud
'Til my nigga Carlton Fisk see the boss, truly yours, Mr. Meth
Life's a snippet, one way ticket
Time tickin' fast, blink you might miss it
Semen on street shit, you might catch fifty stitches
Body bag sprayed up, buried in muddy ditches
I play for keeps, bust heat you catch cold feet
My rap sheet, speak for itself, concrete
Evident, killa hill, resident, double dart agent
Secret, intelligent, my rap style's flagrant
Feel the sting of a killa bee, Johnny Blaze
Street life, deck and mobb deep, play for keeps
In the city that you never sleep, pay attention
Ain't no shittin' when you gotta eat, we hold it down
I move like Mad Max 'cross the wasteland
One hand holds the head of the last brave man
Made man, Cuban link chain of command
Authorized fam', hot like Sahara sand
My live team turn the club to a crime scene
High beams flash, promoters die behind cream
Get your face blown, might face the chrome
We take this more serious than just a poem
I think about a lot of shit, especially when I'm bent
About the foul shit goin' on in my life, current event
It's evident I smoke cigarette down to Brownsville
Thinkin' to myself, how many lives must my pound kill?
Hopefully none, ain't the one to give chase
Hemmed by Jake, worryin' who might turn state's
So I chill, put my killa niggas on the battlefield
On the low plottin' silent murderer, never doubt still
Never follow beef, hey, beef follow me
Wanna settle it in the court? I say settle it in the streets
Like our pops did it, you got gats get hot with it
Now you dry snitchin', because you got knocked with it
I just rock with it, go with the flow, think for a hot minute
Stash my dough secure the funds of profit
Yo, extreme rhyme niggas, you wastin' your time
Fuckin' with my niggas, extraordinary line swishin'
Your mind out position, tryin' to figure this shit
Rewind it and listen quick, you might miss this
Olympic, rap jave-lon, travel beyond, your weak song
Doin' this for too long, to not come strong
You're only a pawn of viet dong
Tryin' to form against mines, you musta just been born
Secluded on a distant farm, this is the real world
Where niggas get shot and shanked, where there's tremendous pain
You get your frame inflamed crushed to dust by the next man's clutch
It's infamous you fucks, intense bad luck
Feel the sting of a killa bee, Johnny Blaze
Street life, deck and mobb deep, play for Keeps
In the city that you never sleep, pay attention
Ain't no shittin' when you gotta eat, we hold it down
Stand strong on our two feet, we all ready
For a war here, fuck peace, what?
Feel the sting of a killa bee, Johnny Blaze

For a war here, fuck peace, peace
More two
One, two
More two
Check one, two

Here comes the ruckus, the motherfucking ruckus
Thousands of cut-throats and crumb-snatching fuckers
Straight from the brain, I'll be giving you the pain, anger
Coming from the 36th Chamber, Bang!
Tical, hitting with the Buddha-Fist style
Shotgun slamming in your chest-piece, pow!
Frame is blown all over the terrain
Like a man without no arms you can't hang
Time for a change of the guard
You've been arrested for lyric fraud now you barred
For real, check it, I pull strings like B.B. King on guitar
I'm the true Fist of the North Star!

Ooooooooh! What a tangled web we weave
When first we practice to deceive
Guns be clicking, running with my clan we be sticking
Whatever, my street family stays together
Represent what I invent, Killa Hill
Resident, rest in peace to my nigga Two Cent
The street life is the only life I know
I live by the code style it's mad P.L.O...
Iranian thoughts and cover like an Arabian
Grab a nigga on the spot and put a nine to his cranium

I..can't...get no satisfaction, niggas won't be lasting
Long, unless they get protection, for real
Strong, coming with my Clan so what's happening
Commercial rap, hate it with a passion

The M-E-T-H-O-D got me drinking O.E. all night in a M.P.V
Just maxing, looking for hoes, you know relaxing
Bitches know the hour it be time for some action

You leave me on fire when
You lead me like a siren
You leave me on fire when
You lead me like a siren


If only you could see everything from my point of view
You would understand the truth of things you would not misconstrue
Baby, let me into your heart, I want every part of you
Down to the itty bitty molecules for particles
If you just give me a chance
I'll show the god in you
We could go back to the garden and do what lovers do


I want everything
This world can give
A nice car to drive
A nice home to live
Money in my pocket
Love in my bed
It's my daily bread


You leave me on fire when
You lead me like a siren
You leave me on fire when
You lead me like a siren


If only you could see everything from my point of view
You would understand the truth of this and you would not misconstrue
Baby let me into your heart, I want every part of you
If you just give me a chance, Ill show you god in you
And we could go back to the garden and do what lovers do


You know I party like a rockstar
And you can catch me eating guppy at the shark bar
I see you Irif what up Allah U Akbar
8 million stories in the backseat of a cop car
But I dont need to go to jail I already got bar
Cut the coke with the baking soda I rock hard
For no charge or debit we call em flash cards
We flashin money in here, call that a flash mob


Check the dark star status, see the rhinestone jacket afar
Meth, R and P, my guitar string bleed
Rhyme superstar on the weed
RZA-Ra striking the keys, it's like heaven sent


I want everything
This world can give
A nice car to drive
A nice home to live
Money in my pocket
Love in my bed
It's my daily bread
Yo I want everything
That this world can give
A nice car to drive
A nice home to live
Money in my pocket
And love inside my bed
And I praise the lord for my daily bread
We rise and roll rock and roll
Trying to find a pot of gold
To free from the strife of todays economy
Trying to find a pot of gold
Trying to find a pot of gold




Yeah that's how it be's
Cause it be's like that sometimes you know
Ay, Cilvaringz man, I wish you nothing but the best
Make sure you stay on top of your game, playboy
Cause ain't no way you gon' be a player unless you stay up
On top of your game, playboy,  pimping
All right then, y'all be easy to the next motherfucking chapter
The Wu Saga continuous, peace!


When this ring appears again in the future, it'll be your death




The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man


Yo, pa, I got a lady, I'm 'bout to make her my baby
Might even make a baby, the thesis makin' her crazy
She know my style wavy, I'm circlin' her Mercedes
Father, father was a preacher, I'm almost certain he hates me
But he ain't gotta date me and look, his baby is grown
And she decides on her own who resides on the throne
I'm her king, she my queen, we keep it right in the zone
And she understands the fact that I'm even right when I'm wrong
When she was prayin' in church, I was playin' in dirt
That's 100, I admit that we both was playin' at first
When opposites attract, I ain't always sayin' it works
I'm just sayin' ain't no use in me strayin', that make it worse
It's Wu-Tang, baby, my crew bang
And she's the preacher's daughter, I just call her my boo thang
And we tighter than shoestrings, or 10 grand in rubber bands
Man, sometimes I tell your parents just don't understand


No. yo, you mean Pastor Brown's daughter?
The preacher, the rich slave-maker of the poorer?
I used to see her Sundays comin' from church
We used to kick it at her window when her pops at work
Yo, her parents didn't play
She couldn't even come out to play on a school day
Thought she was gonna give me some on April Fool's day
(But no, no way) nah, (no, no-no, no-no, no-no way)


The preacher's daughter, she an illegitimate child
She know the word, but she be runnin' in them streets foul
She married to a man, but she's crushin' his brother now
See her in the market place loud and boisterous
With tight spandex on, chokin' her oysters
She a seductress in the form of a goddess
Never virtuous or modest, poison the part is
Breakin' the vessel, turn brother against brother
Man, that's how she molest you
That's why the preacher man prolly a mess too
Cause the fruit that she devourin' is evil
Never sin around righteous people
Black widow, preacher's daughter comin' to eat you


The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man


I met her on the bus stop with black eyes
That's why she said she don't fuck with black guys
I cleaned her up, fed her all my wisdom
Her father spit the gospel but she never caught the vision
Brutal ass whoopins, always facin' these evictions
So she only fuck with thugs that'll wind up in the system
Them greasy bastards quick to squeeze a ratchet
Never knew the science of virtue, Ecclesiastes
Like, a time for peace, a time for war
A time to laugh though, she never felt God before
Eternal love that'll pop like a kernel, this is grown folk talk
Between me and her, it don't concern you


The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man




*kung fu fighting*
Yeah, uh, heheheh (That's Shadowboxing!)
Yo...


It's that Blackout, spazzed out, G-String divas
Leave you assed out, passed out, it's cold
Pack your heat up, blow your back out
You bad mouth, make 'em all believers
Throwing rocks from a glass house, y'all ain't perfect either
See that cheeba and that hash out (garbage day tomorrow)
And I have yet to take that trash out, or emptied this cigar
RZA Ra, we amped, eh, Meth is on his job
It ain't nothing, like the French say; "que sera sera"
So let's move on, until the day we laying in the casket
With them suits on, and I'm so cool that hell is only luke warm
Been too strong, for too, long, I'll probably die
With my boots on, and on my way to cash a coochie coupon
You know I'm, proper, don't let them boys confuse you
The fact is Meth, I'm harder than bottles made by Yoo-Hoo
Wu-Tang, welcome to the House of Flying Daggers
Where the truth aim, flying out the mouth of flying rappers
There it is...


Now, ask yourself, is this for real, it can't be
My, nigga, if it ain't for real, it ain't me
I, elect myself as presidential M.C
I, elect myself as presidential M.C
Now, ask yourself, why is he so low key
Why, is niggas pimpin' when the game chose me
I, elect myself as presidential M.C
I, elect myself as presidential M.C


Yo, blew 'em and hit 'em, and he went into a spin cycle
Out blew his liver, a river flooded, what's happening
It's drugs we wanted, gloves buttered, thug coverage
This is Fila, white sneaker, Louis Vitton luggage
I came, representative huddle, they all love you
That W, the legacy of little niggas muggin' you
The fuck, what's up with you, yo, you suck, nigga
Benches used to pluck niggas, we be on the roof, like "fuck you"
Them red beams is coming, losers, got to walk the plank
Users, with uzi's on 'em, you move, you getting spanked
Shank broilers banked, alcoholics ranked ballers
They should call us, I rock mad ice like a walrus
The lamesters decided to lure us, we was up in Freedomtown
Getting weeded, one Bentley tour bus, you might like the mack and explore dust
You can't fuck with all of us, one of us dropped, there's twenty more of us




Peel caps like tangerines, you shook/shake like tamberines
Then, jet from the set, in the all black Lamborghin'
Nobody seen me, bitch in a tini red bikini
Niggas saw her, because they thought they saw a genie
Heidi Klum, pussy juicy, fat as a plum
Picture on the wall in jail, niggas jerk til they come
God gargantuan, large, colossus, bombardment of darts
Make your squad, throw tantrums
Practice karma sutra on broads, pop bra's
Leave birds with permanent scars, and shit like birthmarks
Digi bark back at dogs, snatch flies from frogs
Blow California chronic to despise the smog
This shit I been with biz in the clearing, pigs sharing
Got fresh, Wu-Wearing, motherfuckers not caring
Then move through your community, with diplomat immunity
Move to rep a two or G., shine like fine jewelry




The Shadow Sword... Shadow Sword...




You don't want no problems, problems
You don't want no problems, problems
Yeah... real man... with ya stinkin' ass
Come on... that's my nigga right there... let's do it
Never count me out, nigga, just count me in... yeah...


Look, I ain't came to bone these chicks
Not this time, I got a bone to pick, I got a zone of piff
Now, who that nigga in the zone and shit
Back in the building like he own the bitch, nobody cold as this
If I ain't got it, then it don't exist
I spit that bird flu, my flows is sick, I'm still as ill as they come
Protect Ya Neck, when you dealing with them
Now Erick stick a fork in him, he done, hah
It boggles the mind, like try'nna 'ketchup' to a bottle of Heinz
It's like forensics try'nna follow the crime, they want time
And sometime, a nigga had to swallow them dimes
While 85 percent swallowing swine, see
Wherever he roam, it's all gravy, man, whenever he home
Long as I got myself I'm never alone, feel even better with chrome
If there's a problem, nigga, let it be known
And while I sleep, my bitch be checkin' my phone, cause I'm a problem, nigga


Ease up, or put them g's up
Scream at ya frog, nigga leap up (now who got a problem with that?)
They need to beast up, nigga, speak up or
Forever hold they peace up (if they got a problem with that)
Hey you (don't want no problem nigga) Hey you (don't want no problem nigga)
Hey you (don't want no problem nigga) Hey you (don't want no problem nigga)
Hey you ("Believe, what I say, when I tell ya" - DMX sample)
Yeah, you, nigga, you don't want no problem with that


Look, my Clan all one in the same
Until my name number one in the game, it's not a game, nigga
Like Billy Danze, I be running with Fame
Me and my lynch mob coming to hang, it's Wu-Tang for life
Hard body, another day in the life
Credit his momma now for raising him right, just want the people to know
I'm bout to blow, like I'm shaking the dice
Making me mad? Nah, y'all making me right, cause y'all was taking me light
So let my pen talk and say what he like
And have the court system say and indict, I'm O.J.ing the mic
Liquid plumber, I be laying the pipe
And if it's tight, girl, I'm staying tonight
Not only raising on the price, on M.C.'ing, but I'm raising the bar
And if you scary, nigga, wait in the car
Motherfuckers I'm hard, hard as cooked up in mayonaise jars
Purple haze, Cuban layed cigars, I'm a problem, nigga




E, you know I'm just like that
Big baller nigga, just like Shaq, so come on, niggas
If they bust, I better bust right back
Meth spit it from the gut, like *gunshot* man down
I'm that dude, hands down, stand down
I'm past due, for Cash Rule, y'all can't clown
I'm bank now, your ass lose, nothing but rhyme
New York Times, I'm bad news, and I'mma problem, nigga






The Fuck?
It's just the new way of thinkin
Light up the broccoli kid
Throw the relish in my back pocket
Keep your eyes open
Push your seat back, just flow...
That's how we doin it

Bound by honest sword take over the set; rap from here to Que-bec
Throw up the tech, crash your intellect select a vet
Swimsuit mammal handle, yo every fly vandal go to project
Slam you like Hamill's wife 'fore the scandal
Wally sandal just a sample, my niggas fertilize thoughts
Yo mad support drink a quart then bamboo
When nasty can blew, my pen sterile won't perform if I'm not lampable
Askin my man'll get you slapped down; play the anthem
Lit it who wit it champagne get it, that's the ticket
Solid nines soundin like crickets snatchin worker shipment
Pull the air, long dick it, we talk right before we left lifted
Just like a long sleeve, guess who rip it?

 Projects
 My niggas survive, just like a movin target
 Projects
 Where niggas live and some sell garbage that's
 Projects
 Try to escape the flyin shells dodgin
 New York projects
 I'm livin large yo, stop miragin


Sign of the times, conspiracy to overthrow the mind
Behind every fortune there's a crime
This technique is tech-9
Blast at any Close Encounter of the Third Kind
This be the evil that man do, we dismantle, any adversary
Them niggas all thumbs and can't handle, my flurry
Hear me, you jam all you want to scare me
Don't even kid me, shit in my coke aimin at cha kidney
Pressure, Red Hot like Chili Pepper
Black 'n Decker, hardware avoid the leper
Five o'clock shadowboxer, hold down the sector
Bet ya bottom dollar lecture, be hard to swallow
Double oh-seven mark
The secret agent that Max/well and Get Smart, through entertainment
Welcome to The Killin Fields, with Johnny Dangerous
Headbanger boogie niggas goin thru changes

 Projects
 My niggas survive, just like a movin target
 Projects
 Where niggas live and some sell garbage that's
 Projects
 Try to escape the flyin shells dodgin
 Projects
 I'm livin large yo, stop miragin


Suck my dick it's the kid with the fat knob
I bust all into ya face, plus it come in globs
Quick get on your knees, with yo' sweet pussy let it breathe
Two fingers is all in your hole, think I can fit three
Your pink lips, spread it in shit, let me throw my dick in
Grab my shit and place it gently, on your clit
Ping-pong pussy, wide world of wombs titty saggin
Stomach on some scriveled up prune shit
Too much air in your pussy you screamin that it's
TALKIN TO YOU DADDY, fart's breathin out your lips splashin my dick badly
Use vinegar, to try to tighten up your ginger
All-mighty dick, ran in with a cape, some call him engine
Lightning rod bob, black candy cane attatched to God
Thick, like a great adventure cigar, in your garage
Pregnant pussy have you fall out, like Remi on the house
Watch the teeth for slobbin my shit
You bit it on the couch, dry pussy leave the friction burns
Plus beef I hone, the condom broke
Bitch you got AIDS I'm shakin in my bones




Caller: "So whassup, man?"
DJ: "Coolin', man."
C: "Chillin' chilin'? Yo, you know I had to call, you why right?"
DJ: "Why?"
C: "Because, you, I never ever call and ask you to play somethin', right?"
DJ: "Yeah."
C: "You know what I wanna hear, right?"
DJ: "Whatchu wanna hear?"
C: "I wanna hear that Wu-Tang joint."
DJ: "Wu-Tang again?"
C: "Ah yeah, again and again."


I smoke on the mic like "Smokin' Joe" Frazier
The hell-raiser, raisin' hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider-Man
So uhh, tick tock and keep tickin'
While I get you flippin' off the shit that I'm kickin'
The Lone Ranger, code red: Danger
Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart
The vandal too hot to handle
You battle, you're sayin' goodbye like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspectah Deck's on the set
The Rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal


The way I make the crowd go wild
Sit back, relax, won't smile
Rae got it goin' on, pal
Call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat
Blow up your project, then take all your assets
'Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, go flip on the next man
'Cause I grab the clip and
Hit you with 16 shots and more, I got
Goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh


It's the Method Man, for short Mr. Mef
Movin' on your left, UH!
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break, fool, cock me back
Small change, they puttin' shame in the game
I take aim and blow the nigga out the frame
And like Fame my style will live forever
Niggas crossin' over, but they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a "Suuu"?
Nuff respect due to the 1-6-oooh
I mean ohhh, yo, check out the flow
Like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off, because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt make me *cough*


Ooh, what, grab my nut, get screwed
Oww, here comes my Shaolin style
True B-A-ba-B-Y-U
To my crew with a "Suuuuuuu"


C'mon, baby baby, c'mon, baby baby
C'mon, baby baby, c'mon


Yo, you best protect ya neck


First things first, man, you're fuckin' with the worst
I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a fuckin' nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zu
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down, that shit is packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin'
Ason Unique rollin' with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
Bite my style, I'll bite your motherfuckin' ass


For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
There's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats; if Rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stompin' grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin' star
'Cause who I are is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar
Point-blank as I kick the square biz
There it is, you're fuckin' with pros, and there it goes


Yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that
It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feelin' mad hostile, wearin' Aropostale
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy robe, then attack the globe
With the buck-us style, the ruckus
Ten times ten men committin' mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums
(He'll be) comin' around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one down
Ju-Jugger-Genius, take us the fuck outta here


The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap
That's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact, bring out the girls, and let's have a mud fight!


You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck




Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to welcome to you
All the way from the slums of Shaolin
Special uninvited guests
Came in through the back door
Ladies and gentlemen, it's them!


Dance with the mantis, note the slim chances
Chant this anthem, swing like Pete Sampras
Taking it straight to Big Man On Campus
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Scandalous, made the metro panic
Cause static with or without the automatic
And while I'm at it, yo, you got cash, pass it
It's drastic, gotta send half to Dirty Bastard


Waves is spinning, blades is spinning
Slay em in the eighth inning
Stay truck, god stay playing linen
Kill rap, observe the uptowns, ho, feel that
Mink jeans on, seen where the real at
2000 Zitos, moving with a ill ego
For real, for real, ill lines, ill people
Yo, bring it back, 9 more civilians
Pollying deals, monopoly and bills, y'all niggas lying
Caught 300, lab look royal wit a mean stomach
Go broke, all seen, done it
Words from the heavy set, if I don't eat, then we already met
Fly ass bro, liver than coke


Now what Clan you know with lines this ill?
Bust shots at Big Ben like we got time to kill
Niggas can't gel or I'm just too high to tell
Put on my gasoline boots and walk through Hell
With 9 generals, 9 ninjas in your video
9 milli blow, semi-auto with no serial
Man metaphysical, I speak for criminals
Who don't pay they bills on time and fuck with digital
Never seen, smoke a bag of evergreen
My sword got a Jones, more heads for the severing
Johnny in the dungeon, taking all bets, throw ya ones in
Scared money don't make money, throw ya guns in


That's word to Damo, San Juan, Puerto Rico
Blowin hydro on a beach wit Tamiko
My gun bullet hollow for you to swallow
Blowin' the nozzle, hear it whistle
One in the head, this is code red, man for dead
X amount of lead spray from the barrel
Heat clear the street like Connor O'Carroll
Fully equipped, rifles, banana clip shit
To make my niggas from East New York flip


Yo, you may catch me in a pair of Polo Skipperys, matching cap
Razor blades in my gums (BOBBY!)
You may catch me in yellow Havana Joe's goose jumper
And my phaser off stun (BOBBY!)
Y'all might just catch me in the park playin' chess, studyin' math
Signin 7 and a sun (BOBBY!)
But you won't catch me without the ratchet, in the joint
Smoked out, dead broke or off point (BOBBY!)


Wallo's comfortable, chocolate frosting
Your socks hangin' out, yours is talkin'
Rock so steadily, son, I'm still crazy
Sport my old Force MD furs from the 80's
Nat Turners wit burners, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Taught y'all niggas how to rap, reimburse me
Rothsdale's, ruby red sales, Bloomingdale's, blocks
Ox tails chopped up in Caribbean spots
I'm nice, maxed out, creepin' wit the ax out
Murder these bikini bitches, switchin with they backs out


Niggas wanna pop shit, I pop clips
Bitch, I'll put my dick on ya lips
Alabama split, hammer slay quick
That David Banner gamma ray shit
Shells in the mouth, jailhouse snitch
My powder voice, Snow White sniff
Verbal killas, gorilla grip
God body shit, puff Marley spliffs


You might see me in a 6, that's not my style
You might see me wit a bitch, that's not my child
I be in the benzo, keep a low profile
Dead serious, take flicks and don't smile
Tryin' to get money, y'all cats is wild
I pose for the clothes, make a song like wild
I'm a chip off the board game, got sword game
Live life to the fullest, still want more fame
Darts on layaway, beats on standby
Outfits pressed up, ready for airtime


Run on the track like Jesse Owens
Broke the record flowin', without any knowin'
That my wordplay run the 400 meter relay
It's on once I grab the baton from the DJ
A athlete wit his iron cleat in the ground
Wireless nigga who sprint off the gun sound
The best time yet still 7.0
Swift flow made the cameramen clothes blow



Verse 

We make the club jump every time we walk in this bitch
Yea, we shining. You can tell my niggas is rich
Rozay and Patron at my throne, women at my feet
Staring like they want me to beat
This New York rap, I'm on the other side of the map
Nine nickel plate strap with a bitch on my lap
Back to back on the FDR, big cigar
You can tell there's a star in one of these cars
She's with Ghostface, yeah a bird on her wrist
Mask on face, ***********************
Everybody try but they can't do it like this
This Don Donna it starts I bet I won't miss

Hey yo



(Repeat 2x)
Pull them cars out
We gettin money over here
Them bottles on the table
The weed in the air
Your woman starin at us
Them haters ice grillin
Wu-Block, you know we in the buildin

Verse 2: 

Every little spot they know me
Loyal females who can't just give me the twat
They show me like I'm a big stock broker on Wall Street
I said, "Nahh, I'm that big drug dealer from 4E!"
A lot of guacamole, know a lot of parolees
Slung in front of a lot of these delis eatin cannolis
I stayed on the front line like private events in airports
And live by the code I'mma bust mine
Word, tunes, start shorty while I got a tongue in my ear
Don't get a stain on my Porsche
Light-skined said she a virgo
Said she love my roll game and my bird yo
A baby ghost appeared from the blunt smoke
It lingered through her hair and set into her clothes
Her bag fell, I saw a 38 snub nose
I stole that and still fucked her when the club closed

Chorus 2x



Bust honey on your face, hundred stacks on the car
If I spend a rack today, get that rack back tomorr
I'm a cash ruler, rulers zig-zag allah
Get my money off the hook like I'm Abdul-Jabar
Get my money off the book like Steve Paul
Then fall, act hard, but they livin
They think like a man, but act like they women
I never trust a broad with that in God trust only trust in God
Look at me, I'm what these little haters wanna be
I'm your man, 50 grand and I keep it a hundred G
I'm that block on fire, it's like a hundred and three
Rappers come a dime a dozen but they don't come in tha peace
I only need a few raps when you comin with cheese
And the people you come up with, they be comin to me
We got the city under siege
Where the tightest ladies
Wear the tightest dungarees

Chorus 2x




It's the Meth in the house! Ha, yeah, break it down

When it's all said in done, we gon' be on top
Cause we don't stop, now, lock it down, hit the spot
And clown; Niggas relyin on special effects
While the khakis and chronic, got the bitches still breakin they neck
Move the crowd without breakin a sweat
Trend setter, with a Beretta, so keep it on deck
Cause you never know when Xzibit gonna move through the set
Don't be scared, just be prepared and quiet as kept
At a night club, talkin bout you don't go out
And you tryin to got to school and make a certain amount
But the last part, I just couldn't figure it out
I guess its real hard to talk with a dick in your mouth
Lightweight, like confetti, steadily tested by motherfuckers who ain't ready
To deal with the legendary
Soopafly, emcee, and bullett logo
Shot callers, clear the whole block like we po-po


Round and round we go, it don't stop
Till we all get dough, c'mon, make it hot
Baby girl to the pussy pop, pussy pop
Lick shots for the pussy pop, pop, pop!
Lookin good with your stink-ass
Type of ass make a nigga pull it over fast
Make it hot, baby girl to pussy pop, pussy pop
Lick shots for the pussy pop, pop pop!

Well, you gotta pop the pussy, get rid of the next with a name on your gums
It's the ?Bidulo Gang? bitch, we both want some
You got titties and ass
But I got a dick and some cash
You ain't talkin bout shit
Then I'ma smash, bitch
On three, on me, bitch, you my property
Daddy Jayo Felony, ain't nobody stoppin me
And I said daddy, bitch thats what you gon' call me
I ain't no simp or a wimp
I'ma motherfuckin pimp
Tear spots in my hoes, make they high-heels fall off
You got me ? the fuck-up, if you think I'm goin soft
On ya; I'm hard on my hoes that's how it goes
Bitch, get up off your toes, and get my six-four
? My name, you bounced, so you might as well break bread
And only Dulo niggas know, whats the head
My name is Billy Loco and this is my opinion
I'm coming from SD, and Dulo is my religion
Be-b-b-b- atch!



I don't save or pray, or ? clothes
All I really wanna do is win the game, fuck hoes!
In Jamaica, at the Half Moon Villa, with a killa
And a cocain dealer, layin low from the law
See it all comes down to who's quick to draw first
Pay attention, prevention, ridin off in a hearse
Mister X to the you know me
Thousand-dollar bitches wanna pop the pussy for free
The disfunctional member of the Alkoholik family tree
Frequently bang bitches, Wu-Tang, Killer Bee
Hennessey on the rocks, with Pina Coloda
At the Ramada, make you work hard like Donna
For the cheese, got you down on your hands and knees
After that we kick back and burn up some trees
Mad shout, cause Xzibit's not the type to be treatin
I'm an Alkoholic and I'm late for my meeting
(Come on, Like that!)







Mista Meth in the house! Ha, yeah, break it down



When it's all said in done, we gon' be on top
Cause we don't stop, now, lock it down, hit the spot

Round and round we go, it don't stop

Type of ass make a nigga pull it over fast

You will be punished (Wu-Tang style)
For all your evil deeds (Wu-Tang style)
Be warned - you will suffer (Wu-Tang style)
Justice (Wu-Tang style)


Slept on this hazardous enterprise
Hit from the back, from a long range attack in disguise
Week self-captivity became months
Those who were holdin' it down they hold a pump
Do we delay the conflict and prolong the suffer?
Got a mass of starvin' niggas wanna eat supper
Unfair corruptions lead to abductions
Creatin' wider circles of destructions
So we attack, with the pen and blaze in
From the terrifyin' to the fascinating
Quick to slay a narrow minded nigga that's hasty to give credit
Full of hostile overtones mixed with wack edits
They heavily defended airfields
But they bodies rot behind punctured steels
When I greeted you, you didn't hear a piece of my voice?
Oh that water was my liquid of choice
Forensic couldn't tell it, it was nine tons of steel pellet
Powerful projection, noise is deafening
Carrier battle groups, that's threatening
Higher level bombing, plus
The shipment in hand known as alarming, bells ring loud
In the same crucial manner but different style


Wu-Tang style
Wu-Tang style


Ayo once again, all blunts again
Yo the real remain silent, any type of violence I'm in
Allah's helpful most, innovative raps
That brought wealth through, shot out the belch too
We holdin', automatic semis with sick lines
Run up, body niggas, break down shoddy niggas
Styles so sharp, state of the art
Greater the mark, flyest creator sprayed layin' darts
Flowin' like water, "Apocalypse Now"
Gun out blaow, wow the shit's wild when you short us
Runnin' through parkin' lots, don't get caught
Let off, bark your shots, we outta here, off the blocks


It ain't all to the good, muh'fuckers hatin' in the hood
Gotta a hundred wolves waitin' in the woods
For the Clan's forthcomin'
I miss you in the game a court summons
And fugitives of rap caught runnin, y'all get locked up
E'rything was wack 'til we popped up
And got it on and poppin' like Orville Reddenbacher
Potnah, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
Wu-Tang got ya, like every ghetto got a Tasha
Request lines are now open, you see these MC's chokin'
And thinkin', "What's that SHIT they be smokin'?"
I'm so focused, simple chronic halitosis
Keep my shit funky when I spit this braggadocious
{*hach, spit*} Y'all niggas got some fuckin nerve
To critic what I write, that's my muh'fuckin word
Blah blah blah, like N'Sync
Kiss that ass bye bye bye knahmsayin'? I ain't playin'


Many shall come, few chose to stay exact
Track after track I'm fightin' for survival
Before me I see hills and mountains they sway
The words gotta move and the crowd's like the ocean
I walk water holdin' y'all suspended with the vocal
What's the total people that came to see the Gods?
I gave thought talent, construct my best poetry
Potentcy, high-level content
Side effect may cause a tec to eject, many places
All ages streets to cages, split faces
Shoutin' nuff love to the peeps from Miami
We live from Pulaski and spread glassy


Wu-Tang style



(Verse 1  Method Man)
Hey. I swear I never change
If Im with you in the sunshine, Im with when it rains
Ill never switch, Im still the same
Get caught up in the mix, I never snitch or give up game
Im no squealer
Police be trying to pick the killers brain
Not familiar, thats why some brothers go against the grain
Im La Familia, Im hands on
But that dont mean the name Im tryna fill ya
My hands strong, i aint trying to take your chain
Im trying to kill ya
Orangutan, you monkeys tryna
Hang like youre gorillas
I give you Wu-Tang slash gilla
The object in the mirror, Mac Miller
My method is the illest slash illa
Im trying to get the guap, cash scrilla
But whitey only see a crack dealer
Michael Jack thriller, this is not The Walking Dead
Rapper think hes Chalky White
He get the white chalk instead
Meth Lab, killing everything thats in the way
Until the son say

(Bridge)
The Meth Lab dudes dont play

(Verse 2  Hanz On)
Had these dude thinkin damn, when it rains, it pours
News flash, Meth back, whole Staten with him
Couldnt come to terms, how they playing with this rap
Dont be understanding all the substance that it lacks
Gorilla out the traps, bout to flip
Ten years gone probably saw him in the flicks
Red tails Belly, motherfucker, was the shit
Rap coalition, meth lab, get em lit
Yo its crazy how these niggas try and do it like we did it
Careful if you copy end up money on your fitted
Side line critics
Hate the bully with the Wessons
I swear to god in heaven, dont get caught without your weapon
Caught without your weapons, it get ugly in a second
Sidearms hover like we bought em from The Jetsons
Meth lab, vocab, kill em where they lay
Got em sittin sayin

(Bridge)
The Meth Lab dudes dont play

(Verse 3  Dro Pesci)
Im used to the rain, I dont see the sun too much
Nocturnal hustler grinding, holding them drugs too much
Bench press my pen, on my fresh pad
Just left the crack house, Im headed to Meths lab. The tech jab
Cowards in their face when they scheming I bet cash
Frown up on their face leave em bleeding, who wants what?
Thats my attitude all day, You snooze, you lose, thats why Im making moves all day
The tool gonna spray
I suggest you stay in your lane
Staten niggas aint playing, you get banged for your chain
I bang with a gang, a poppin mind bangin up thangs
Accurate aim, well-trained, angle and range
Dismantle your frame, microphones blown into the flames
Pesci the name, Professional, perfecting the game
Im wrecking these lanes
Sharpshooter killing all day
Had these haters say

(Bridge)
The Meth Lab dudes dont play




Your reign on the top was short, like Leprechauns
As I crush so called Willies, Thugs & Rapper Dons
Get in that ass quick, fast, like Ramadan
It's that rap phenomenon
(It's that rap phenomenon)


Doo doo, doo doo do
(Phenomenon)
Doo doo do doo
(Phenomenon!)
Doo doo dooo doo do, doo doo doo doo do doo doo doo doo doo!
*grunt*


(I got more Glocks and techs than you)
I make it hot (Nigga won't even stand next to you)
Nigga touch me you better bust me
In the head
Or motherfucker's dead
Irritating like the hiccups
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis, deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfucking rap phenomenon




(That was wonderful!) Bravo! (I loved it!) Ah, it was great!
(Well, it was pretty good.) Well, it wasn't bad
(Uh, there were parts of it that weren't very good, though) It could have been a lot better. (I didn't really like it.) It was pretty terrible
(It was bad.) It was awful! (It was terrible!) Take 'em away!
(Hey, boo!) Boo!




"Well it's the Funk Docta Spock.."
"Meth-Tical.."
"Biggie.. Biggie.." (mmmhmmmmmm)


Uhh.. uhh.. uhh.. (yo c'mon Big) uhh..
Fuck that, I preach it, my nine reaches
The prestigious, cats that speak this, Willie shit
Flooded pieces, my hand releases, snatches
Smack ya cabbage, half-ass rappers, shouldn't have it
So I grab it, never run, the outcome
Is usually, a beatdown brutally, fuck who you be
Or where you're from, West or East coast, squeeze toast
Leave most in the blood they layin in, what, what?
The rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
It's more than I expected, I thought your jewels was rented
But they wasn't, so run it, cousin
I could chill, the heat doesn't
Ran up in your shell about a dozen
You never see bank like Frank White
Your hand clutchin, your chest-plate contemplate
You 'bout to die, nigga wait, keep yo' hands high


Yo.. yo yo
I don't brownnose out of town hoes
I'm up around fo' with the crowbar to the five point oh
I get bagged, I'm John Doe, suspect
You ass like prime roastin, Calvin Klein clothes
Explode the pyros when Doc guest appear
I'm out there, I bought it with George Jetson here
Your time is near, so get your body dropped off
I stopped trustin niggas since Gotti got caught
It's Bricks keep your wrist covered, or piss colored
By the waist got a gun as dark as Kris brother
I.C.U., my sheisty crew, like ice me too
I break your legs, leave your eyes slightly blue
The Doc was born with a grenade palm
I'm concurrent in your hood like a, teenage mom
Yo Biggie (what? what?) She havin my bay-bayy
If I pull out the A.K., keep your hands high


"This rule is so underrated.." -]
"Actin as if it can't happen, you're frontin" -
"Ain't no other kings in this rap thing.." -
"Biggie, a motherfuckin rap phenomenon" -



Uhh, uhh
I got a new mouth to feed, I'm due South with keys
Y'all pick seeds out y'all weed, I watch cowards bleed
Motherfucker please, it's my block with my rocks
Fuck that hip-hop, them one-two's, and you don't stops
Me and my nigga Lance, took Kim and Cee's advance
Bought ten bricks, four pounds of weed plants
From Branson, now we lampin, twelve room mansion
Bitches get naked off "Get Money", "Player's Anthem"
Don't forget, "One More Chance" and, my other hits, other shit
Niggas spit be counterfeit, robbery come actually
In and out like fuckin rapidly, pass the gat to me
Make his chest rest, where his back should be, talkin blasphemy
Blastin me, your family, rest in coffins often
Frank Wizzard, fuck you soft or fragilla
Play hard like Reggie Miller, rapper, slash dope dealer
Slash Gorilla, slash illest turned killer



Now now
Don't approach me with that rah rah shit, you out of pocket
I take these adolescents back to Spofford
Mentally my energy, is like a figure eight, on it's side
That's infinity -- too many sick niggas, nickel nines;
Bring the remedy -- when you play the field, what's the penalty
Unnecessary roughness, career endin injuries for suckers
Stuck on stupid, shoot em with a dart like Cupid
Until they got love for my music
Star Wars I'm Han Solo, with three egoes
And three charges, I got to "See-three-P.O.'s"
This is whoop-yo'-ass-day, the sequel
Eyeball blower with no equal, niggas swingin swords in the WAR
That's my people, sho' nuff, befo' I roll up
This is a hold up, hands high, reach for the sky
I rep S.I., the unpretty, word to Left Eye
New York Shitty, put they weight on it
And who better for the job than Biggie? The Notorious
Jeee-zus, "Unbelievable" rhyme that reaches
And touch individual, small frame buck and change
MC, What's-Your-Name, tuck your chain
All about the fortune, fuck the fame, labels still extortin
Kick me when I'm down, but I'm up again, scorchin
Hot -- forcin my way up in the door
To kill the bullshit like a matador
Keep your hands high (what?)






Yeah!
I wanna let allllll y'all niggas know in here tonight
That this is that Wu-Tang shit
This that shit that's gonna get you high... {*echoes*}
See when you stimulate your own mind, for one common cause
You see, who's the real motherfuckers
See what you see, is you what you see
(You nuh see it? Wu-Tang a-run tings!)
Be the original G
Rhymin on timin and in the place to be
(Run blood claat tings!)
They love see meeeeeeee!


You're a crossbreed, I'm a knowledge seed
I want ACTION, that's what I need
I never put doubt in my mind
Cause I know when I touch the mic it's the rhyme
See murder which is caused
When you fuck with the negative and positive charge
Then they came up, out my garage
With the hit that's gonna be LARGE
Tired of sittin on my fuckin ass
Niggas I know, be runnin around with mad fuckin cash
Who the FUCK wanna be an emcee
If you can't get paid, to be a fuckin emcee?
I came out my momma pussy -- I'm on welfare
Twenty-six years old -- still on welfare!
So I gotta get paid fully
Whether it's truthfully or untruthfully
With my Boston bloodthirsty posse
P-E-A-C-E



Move em in move em in
Move em out move em out
Stick it up {*whip sound*} raw hide!


Yea, gotta come back to attack
Killin niggas who said they got stacks, cause I don't give a fuck
{*inhales*} I wanna see blood, whether it's period blood
Or bustin your fuckin face, some blood!!
I'm goin out my FUCKIN mind!!
Everytime I get around devils {*breathing hard*}
Let me calm down, you niggas better start runnin
Cause I'm comin, I'm dope like fuckin heroin
Wu-Tang Bloodkin, a goblin, who come tough like lambskin
Imagine, gettin shot up with Ol Dirty insulin {*sucks air*}
You bound to catch AIDS or somethin
Not sayin I got it, but nigga if I got it you got it!!
WHAT?!? {*echoes*}


Yo, check the bulletproof fly shit, strong like thai stick
Then I'll remain to tear your frame, while I freaks it
Like some fly new sneaks and shit
Now EAT my shit, bitch tried to creep and got hit
Now regulate, and I'll be out to set up a date
Wu-Tang, is bangin like a Ron G tape
RZA pump the shit just like a shotty
Watch me run it John Gotti
Collidin on the track, like gin and watty
Check the calender, I warn any challenger
To step up {*whoosh*} feel the blast from the silencer




Comin soon to a theatre near you it be the Wu
Yeah find yourself in the square and see it's true
Actual facts to snack on and chew
My positive energy sounds peace to you
A wise man killed one horse and made glue
Wicked women puttin period blood in stew
Don't that make the stew witches brew?
I fear for the eighty-five that don't got a clue
How could he know what the fuck he never knew?
God-Cypher-Divine come to show and come to prove
A mystery god that's the work of Yacub
The Holy Ghost got you scared to death kid boo!!


Yeah, we always gotta keep it fly
Fly for you to feel, what you wants to feel
See Wu-Tang'd like to thank, all the people across the country
All the people in America, all the people outside of America
For listenin to our music
We gotta keep it fly for ya
See this ain't somethin new
That's just gonna come out of nowhere, no!!!
This is somethin OLD, and DIRTY!!
And DIRTY!!
Yeah..




RZA came and got me, this what I came to do, come on
Ring the bell so it's time to eat
Brick Dog stash weed inta AMI-seats
Bomb inside the palm
Doc rock a wifebeater with me beatin my wife ass ironed on
The front with my pump built like the Klumps
To carry it I take the spare out the trunk
I stay hungry, I ain't worked for days
That's why you see the pump when the curtains raise
Blast! Don't panic
Do I gotta explain how I tame and lock the rapgame single-handed?
Hell nah! I won't tell you son
If I find a wack ID I sell you one
Doc and Hot Nick, Inspectah
My lecture's like Hannibal Lector's
Where's the ketchup?
Don't speak on it, shut ya trap
I see ya whole crew yellow like mustardpacks
Ah woo, Doc in my own zone
You say you got the rapgames sewn, but it's sewn wrong
I ride through ya hood in a Mr. Softee truck
Then pull a mac out a box of snow cones
Yeah, ya little fucks
Gimme ya fucking money!

*Shout-outs from Raekwon and Ghostface*


Uhuh, check it
I'm hotter than a hundred degrees with my coat on
Playing with a dynamitestick, where did I go wrong?
Somebody pull the fire along when Jonny stomp
If ya lukewarm leavin ya clothes and boots torn
Pro's and con's, megabomb's and so-on's
By arid actions try MC's to get their roll on
First issue got issues
What is hip-hop to Hot Nickles?
It's like Funk Doc to snot tissues, word
Look at my hand and get the third
Finger out ya earhole like: Fuck what you hear
Now that's what I call hardcore, let's act fool
Mr. Fix-It like Handyman I pack tool
I been shitty, I'm from the bowels of the city (New York)
And just because my outfit match don't make me pretty
Baggy dungarees, dick need room to breathe
In a room full of crackers I might cut the cheese
Ain't no rules to the game, if it is we ain't playin
In your business like EPMD, "So What Cha Sayin'"
You co-signin that bullshit yo man tryin
Chaka chaka cha-ta tatat!!
Slugs flyin

*Shout-outs from Raekwon, Ghostface and Inspectah Deck*


Yo, ya
Check, the code echos from magazines to the big screen
Fo' wheel machines like ya wits scream
Kids fiend from the urban to sub-urban
Roll upon me thirstin like: Hey, hey, Mister Dream-Merchant
We roll longer than dice in a casino
Cee-lo in the 4, 5 or 6 with double 0
Behind the tinted windows I lay low
On some hydro tryin to slide from the 5-0
But now I get wild similar to Ol' Dirty
A third time felon just hit with over 30
No worries, style have em so thirsty
First degree heats are quittin on me
Cold turkey, no mercy
I bring the pain of a hundred migraines
But a thousand shoutin my name that's why I came
But first bring the cashburst, then the outburst
My surround sound pound ya ear like Jevon Kearse
I flex muscle outside I find a next hustle
Trouble with ya here and face the TEC-muscle
Even the best buckle win
I take it to the extreme
It gets ugly, but it's what a nigga do to get C.R.E.A.M
This life

*Shout-outs from Raekwon and Ghostface*




"Ayyo, this is Meth, a-k-a Johnny Blaze
Word up and this is second out the Drunken Master
Yeah, I'm fucked up right now- What?!"


"Ayyo, we gon' swing it to the Jersey side, you-know-what-I-mean?
Drunkenstyle '99, Drunken Master up in here ridin' for you and your's
You-know-what-I'm-sayin'? I got my man Redman up in here
And he about to do his thing on the freestyle shit, word up"
("Ohhhhh, I'm in this thing like this")
"So Reggie Noble, get in and do your thing
Get in where you fit in
Set it off like thiiiiiis"
("Ohhhhh.")


I'ma start it like this: niggas ride dick
Come to the D-Town, shit sick
Slap a bitch across her face
Who 'dat comin' through? Erase the taste out 'cha mouth
Then I hide out down South
Tell my Grandma I need a Glock out
She be like, 'Son, what you on the run for?'
It's the Funk Doc comin' through wit' Resevoir
Dogs type of material- Veinarial
Disease, squeeze on these weak-ass M.C.'s
Why ya bitch sweatin' me, Rock The Bells
I battle yo' ass 'til her feet is out like Chanels
And we could go on for days
Whose 'dat nigga runnin' like roaches, spray the Raid
Wit' my niggas in the D, rollin' up the Gands
Anybody wanna test Doc, put up ya hands
Pull out a nine, bust ya mind
When I click, my toungue click like synchronized nines
And I rob ya town and I get down
Pull out the four-pound, br-br-br-br-br-brown
Yes, y'all- Grab my balls
Y'all mothafuckas vacade your college dorm halls
And I stand still, kill at will
Whose that nigga peelin' back bananna peels, cocked back
The dirty rat on the street
All you weak M.C.'s don't wanna test me, want beef?!
Yes, y'all- And I bring it on back
Like O.D.B., Bring It On Back!


Uh. Yo, yo
Up in the sky, playa, who could it be?
Drunken Master, creepin' through the 3-1-3
My nigga Reggie Noble, yo, he got my back
We layin' niggas flat and blazin' up back-to-back
Sacks and when I come through mashin' and dumpin'
Niggas be like 'That's Dre The Drunken... ("Drunken Master")
...Master' 'Bout to blast you wit' the four-pound
Lay you down and escape through the Underground
Blurry like the fog, ridin' wit' my dog
Drunken Mast choke you out like L-A smog
Comin' though with that '99 freestyle
Me and Funk Doc mashin' down 7 Mile
Drunkenstyle '99, nigga- Hell yeah
Wha-wha-what?!


Drunkenstyle '99
Drunken Master
Illin' comin' down and I fuck a bitch faster
Word is bond, no jokin'
Everything I be tokin' and smokin'
Is out of this world and I take your
Girl, rob her for her Shirling coat and dope
Never sniff coke but I'm broke
Got a little change in my pocket wit' a rope ("Where's it at?")
Around my neck wit' a medallion hangin'
I'm on the bitch' big ass, twelve bangin'
Like... I flip my styles like dyke
And rob a white boy for Bajha Bike
I'm trife and your wife like it
If you throw the football, I'ma spike it
Down in your mouth and I pull the Glock out
Like... and that's hype
That type... 'll slap ya ass
Who 'dat, pull out the gun and clap ya ass?!
Just because I rap, I'm not a sucka
Grab the mic like Hulk Hogan, 'Well, ya know Brother?!'
What's this? Comin' down
Funk Doc rob the ice off your wrist
And tell you, smell you
While I locked down, I'm crazy. Locked down in Bellview
That's in New York, M.C.'s feel me
Jersey representin', come hittin'
Like you saw 2Pac wit' two Glocks
Pull out two guns and I bust it on two cops
And I ask who da best
If you don't like me, I put thirty-eight more slugs in your chest
Wit' my man Drunken Masta
Take over this town, run it out of sound
Give a fuck ("Shut it down")
And I start spittin' darts out the tongue, niggas duck!
Peace to my man Jigga-J
My man DMX. What 'cha say?
My man Meth-Tical, Def jam style
If you don't like Doc...



...you can kiss my ass!
You can kiss my ass!
Yo, you can kiss my ass!
Yo, yo, yo- it don't stop
Yo, it don't quit



(Redman)
Microphone coming down when I have to tweak ya
(Break ya) ass, blow your ass one time, peace ta
Dj Twiz, I will leave your ass blind
Cause the ruckus for all you muthafukas
Don't you know me and Method Man jam like smuckers
All you fools out there wanna test these theives
You better come down wit the buddah bless then freeze
And gimme all your loot and your weed muthafuka
You just a cheesy ass sleeve of the grass, blow your ass
Fill the blast from the past when I smoke the hash
It's that Funk Doctor Spock, got it lock
Methtical, get on the mic right now

(Method Man)
My rap guns be blazing, trails, I'm hard as nails
Society's the cage, got me locked down in hell
My mental the track from the shadows of rap
Casualties cuz my reality is strapped
Criminology pays, the sun got the rays
Wit the heat seeking missiles, AKA Johnny Blaze, Ow
Hurt so good, Ow, take it to the Ow, Methtical
Bring it to your headpiece, no Ow
What you wanna do, shit, niggas be like
That's the shit, that make you wanna get high
Now open that high shit, I be choking

(Both)
Yea, word up, 1996 in your ass, in your ass, Funkmaster Flex
Funkmaster Flex, complilation freestyle album, freestyle in your ass
In your ass, in your ass, nigga, anybody out there wanna bring it
Bring it, bring it on, bring it on

(Redman)
We got lyrics for years for all you fuking peers
Now you think muthafukas grate to you ears
That's the freestyle, proclaim your name
Who's that nigga smoking Buddah on the A train

(Method Man)
It's the Funk Doctor Spock, rock the spot, word up
Coming through, got the Glock to your headpiece, what
Release, what, tension, when I mention
Niggas gave no competition to this shit we got here
The real shit, terror to your ear, feel the fear
Coming down, now up the atmosphere, what we doing
Up your spine, move the back, recline
Say some shit that make you wanna get high

(Both)
Word up, how high muthafuka, 1996, peace
Def Squad and Wu-Tang up in this bitch, yea, 1996 shootout



Y'all ready for this?
Ha! I don't think so!
Yeah! Oh, listen to this!
We gonna come at ya!


Cypress Hill!
Yo yo yo - all my niggas say jump up, doc broke out the kennel
A dog on four paws spittin' out the window
Jump up! It ain't no need to fight
We may squeeze the pipe, you gonna bleed tonight
I eat beans and rice, shit up a storm
I walk the streets with shark fin off my arms
Doctor Dolittle, lit off the bone
My bracelet like I raised it off the farm
Home-grown, thick, dirty
My family feud dudes who pack 2's on survey
Jersey and house
Gun like an elephants snout
Pull ya ambulance out
Ya whole team'll get bombarded
Ya on target, and bombed by some unsigned artists
We leave ya hair cut like a blind barber
Cut it, and gave you a line with fine markers
I won't leave till the job is done
Till the last prick nigga take ya wallet, RUN
Doc with the shotty and we both catch a body with Cypress Hill
Yeah!

(Chorus: B-Real)
We don't give a fuck, we live it up till the day we die
You try to deal with us, but you got no blunts to get high
You won't be real with us, but ya reelin' us and you want to ride
You try to deal with us, but you got no blunts to get high


Yo, yo
Blunt smokin', half a bottle of remi open
You either holdin' or half-assed like semi-colon
I leave ya chokin' on them lollipop rhymes ya callin'
So hard, hell I crack the shell on ya candy coatin'
If the shoes fit like Alan I be too thick
Ever since you hit, yo my new chicks a new bitch
Ya know if I can't eat, ya can't sleep
Plus I'm in denial, I just can't admit defeat
My mind is my Glock, keep my third eye cocked
Bust mines off tops, leave a rapper's nerves shocked
Now who's hot and who's not
I want them rocks and that money in ya two socks
Meth the mister, if crime is an art, then let me paint a picture
I'm gone, Kodak can't even frame the riddler
Gold realin', Meth, doc, Cypress Hiller
Whoever think they fuckin' with that, lets be realer

(Chorus)


Take the back seat and smash beats
Smoke blunts through ya lungs and flips ya brain cells like athletes
Run a track meet, the rhymes on ya rap sheet
With the foot long crush bong, look your collapsing, sicko
They go on the break-off, mental breakdown and shit you wouldn't think of
I spread it to Reggie, chances are better but deadly
You wanna be friendly on the get high Bentley
You twisted up, burnt out within seconds
Cos you couldn't hang with the John Blaze methods
Bong hittin', doc spittin', shark bitten
Star stricken, Glock clickin', stop shittin'
Inhale the smoke from the master's lungs
You wanna roll up, yo I'm the fastest one (ha!)
You wanna test with the sess, well first off
That shit is funny like Kid Rock with his shirt off

(Chorus) X2



 (x2)
When I first stepped on the scene, niggas was petrified
Jet back to the lab like they were being chased by homicide
My rap flow does you right Tical
And it will never steer you wrong
And all you bitch-ass niggas in the industry
Your careers won't be lasting long


Check it, I'm the fucking man, who they mention
Noticed that other niggas rap styles is bogus
Doo-doo compared to this versatile voodoo
Blazing, the stuff that ignites stimulation
Inside ya, cause I be that hell sure provider
Providing the rhyme that be deep as the Poseidon Adventure
Niggas need to test they freaking tincture
For the sickness that be spreading with the quickness
Remedies, cousin I be doing on my enemy
Penalty, then I drink forties to they memories
Emotion, coursing through your town street vicinity
Blunt smoke in the air reveals my identity


(Tical.... tical... ti-cal, ti-cal...)
As I keep it moving, we keep it moving uh
Keep it moving, and keep it moving uh
Keep it moving baby we be moving uh
Keep it moving, we keep it huh RHARHHH


What's that rhythm, what's that sound?
Party people getting down
When it hit no doubt about
Just release, yo delf!!


My God, somebody said it's on, if it is then I'll be set
To blow a nigga up with my five fingers of death
I bring it to his whole damn fam, understand if you fronting
On any man down with the Clan, I be coming
For the headpiece you can't cope
For my brother, I bring it to the Pope, word to mother
Serial killer style from the Isles of Stat
My peoples are you with me, where you at?
Shit's getting deep in here, I mean like thick
Niggas looking all in my face like they want dick
It's about to hit the fan, hit the floor
That's all I can stands, and I can't stands no more
What is it? Niggas think they bigger
Because they got their finger on the trigger of a biscuit
They don't know I'm wicked when I start to kick it
Eat they raw sound, wash it down with a Mistic
Better yet a Snapple
Nigga want the juice but he don't want the hassle
So we're trying to overthrow the castle
Better yet the temple I'm coming to your town black down
The rental car, the pistol cocked
If you don't want to burn from the Glock
Then beware, I buck shots, meaning what?
The buck stops here, no more dough will be made
Unless it's being made by who?






Throw your hands in the sky
And wave them from side to side
And if youre ready to spark up the Meth Tical
Let me hear you say stim-uli





Blue Raspberry:
When I first stepped on the scene, niggas was petrified

Check it, I'm the fucking man who they mention
Notice, that other niggas rap styles is bogus
Doo-doo, prepare for this verse Tical voodoo
Blazing, the stuff that ignites stimulation
Inside ya, 'cause I be that house over water
Forgot in the realm that be deep as the Poseidon
Adventure, niggas need to touch they freaking picture
For the sickness, that be spreading with the quickness
Remedies, cousin I be doing on my enemies
Penalty, then I drink forties to they memories
Emotion, rushing through your down street vicinity
Blunt smoke, in the air reveals my identity

(Tical.... tical... ti-cal, ti-cal...)
As I keep it movin, we keep it movin uh
Keep it movin and keep it movin uh
Keep it movin, baby, we be movin uh
Keep it movin, we keep it huh RHARHHH

What's that rhythm what's that sound
Party people getting down
When it hit the baddest man
Just release, yo delf!!

My God, somebody said it's on, if it is then I'll be set
To blow a nigga up, with my Five Fingers of Death
I bring it to his whole damn fam, understand
If he fronting, on any man down with the Clan
I be coming, for the headpiece you can't cope for my brother
I bring it to the Pope, word to mother
Serial, killer, style from Big Isle No Stat
My peoples are you with me where you at?
Shit's getting deep in here, I mean like thick
Niggas looking all in my face like they want dick
It's about to hit the fan, hit the flo'
That's all I can stands and I can't stands no mo'
What is it? Niggas think they bigger
Because they got the finger on the trigger of a pistol
They don't know I'm wicked, when I start to kick it
With the raw sound, wash it down with a Mystic
Then I add a snapple, nigga want the juice but he don't want the hassle
Then we try to overthrow the castle
Better yet the tent when I'm coming to your town
Black man, the rental, God, the pistol
YAH! If you don't want a burn from GLOCK then beware
I buck shots, we move up, the buck stops here
No more dough will be made
Unless it's being made by hoes

What's that rhythm what's that sound
Party people getting down
When it hit the baddest man
Just breathe in, till then

And keep it moving, baby keep it moving
I plan to keep it moving, you know we keep it movin uh
And keep it moving, baby we be moving uh
And keep it moving, you know we keep it moving uh
And keep it moving, you know we keep it moving
Baby we be moving, you know we keep it moo..RARHRAH

Blue Raspberry:
When I first stepped on the scene, niggas was petrified
Jet back to the lab, like they were being chased by homicide
My rap flow does you like Tical, and it will never steer you wrong
And all you bitch-ass niggas in the industry, your careers won't be lasting long

Method Man:
Throw your hands in the sky
And wave em from side to side
And if you're ready to spark up the Meth-Tical
Let me hear you say stimuli

Should I, could I try to say
That I want you every way?
Should I, could I try to say?


Another pack to sell, another crack that got knocked in jailed
While others layin' with the daffodils
Fuck around and seen the cops was the ones busting
At your head, damn, little nigga, you ain't done nothing
Store trips turnin' into corpses
More sips of that Henny spilled, debts are costin'
Of course it's Yah-Sin again, makin' fans tremblin'
And skin 'em and, known to meditate and count Benjamins
Word to mommy or whoever maker
You've been climbin' up the stairs, I'm an elevator, tell your neighbor
That hater attitude is keepin' us down
They wanna know my secrets now
Everybody searchin' for a deeper sound


I'm reportin' from the slums right now
Another mother, someone just shot down
The way she cried was a frightening sound
Man this shit gotta stop somehow
I'm reportin' from the hood right now
Another momma, someone's just shot down
The way she cried was a frightening sound
Man this shit gotta stop somehow
It's gotta be a better way out


Staten Island is iller, off the island they feel us
Some people might not get us but they don't doubt that we're killers
The system tryna kill us cause they don't doubt we're guerrillas
He home after that body then we don't doubt he a squealer
The dealers, everybody wants nice things
The realest get murdered over money and dice games, I get it
If your trap life's a gimmick then everybody a critic
That's a nice place to visit but they ain't tryin' to live it
Raw is how I give it like UG
Cops be askin' questions like, "Who's he?"
But I ain't sellin' no loosies
Brother when you walk in that room past, you lose me
That's why we never kick it like Bruce Lee


I'm reportin' from the slums right now
Another mother, someone just shot down
The way she cried was a frightening sound
Man this shit gotta stop somehow
I'm reportin' from the hood right now
Another momma, someone's just shot down
The way she cried was a frightening sound
Man this shit gotta stop somehow
It's gotta be a better way out


Sufferin' reality, perseverin' my salary
Trapped inside the drama like lookin' at Grey's Anatomy
Thinkin' of ways to capture the plan the creator have for me
It's principles when you the one takin' care of your faculty
Test tube, baby, the meth lab, the left jab
Right hook feel like I million dollars in X tabs
Gotta be a better way, llamas with me every day
It's goin' down everywhere, I'm laughin' while they let it spray
Real niggas' mamas cry, real niggas gotta ride
Some call it revenge, but still it's a homicide
Wonder how their father feel, will real niggas shed a tear?
Or do they only shed blood? They feel like they're forever feared


I'm reportin' from the slums right now
Another mother, someone just shot down
The way she cried was a frightening sound
Man this shit gotta stop somehow
I'm reportin' from the hood right now
Another momma, someone's just shot down
The way she cried was a frightening sound
Man this shit gotta stop somehow
It's gotta be a better way out




Fuck ya'll niggas is talkin' bout? (clack clack-cla-clack clack)
Crunchy chump motherfuckas, ya'll niggas is all pussy
That's my word, ya'll know how the realest niggas is
Don't let me tell ya'll again, bitch, straight up
I put all this right there, on niggas in H.T.M.'s son
Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo


All magazines lit, fly life we live
The lingo is to let, ya'll niggas know, how niggas rep
I'm set, lightin' the purple in a new jet
Triflin' work, let's murder everything that move on the set


Goin' back to basics, shit you catch case with
Style laced with, arsonic, before you taste it
Rap matrix, gemini's is two faced it, I heard Rob Based it
"Bad boys" retire out the game just like Mase did
Dish it out and take it
To where I'm bout to go and everybody ain't gon' make it


Blow shipments out the rap shit, clap shit
Most of us attack shit, mean Benz, ballin' wit the bad chick
Take over, quick fast, violate, slap shit
And every borough, state, town, prison, map shit
Makeover hoes that blow, they attract dick
Shine on my jims, glow, on the low, slap dick
To every mean queen clean, keep it black chick
My motto, CREAM, green bottle of the phat shit




"Brothers respect mine!" - Raekwon
(Uh, uh, what, for real nigga, step the fuck off?)


Aiyo, Ice Cream, real niggas in whips
Fur coats, Gucci boots and shit, fly honey dip
Streets and clips is what we live for, rub on the floor
Ox in the jaw, rockin' the four, rugged and raw
Righteous and more, we the gliders, the outsiders
Killa Bee hivers, the big boy drivers
The conivers, the four fivers, survivors
We the livest and carry the heaters, coke is in the meters
Six to eight seaters, circle the mind readers
Pumas, Nikes, and Adidas, hip hop achievers
Love hood rats and love divas, love money, love sex
Love vets, love weed and love wrecks


All in together now, follow me the Method
Raw individual, the enemy you slept with
No love here, no tender, love and care
But M.C.'s, I'm starvin', niggas best before
For consumption, for wack assumption
You can catch a bad one or somethin'
From shotgun, you know I'm pza-pza-pumpin'
Jumpin', thumpin', get crunk and
Drunk inside the function
+Uncontrolled+ with the +Substance+
+Beneath the Surface+ there's +Redemption+
For Bobby Digital +Supreme Clientele+ convention, +Nigga Please+
+Immobilarity+ they can't breath til they +Blackout!+
I used to write and smoke L's in the crackhouse
Pull your wig like a potato then I mash out
Check your ego at the door
Better wipe your feet before you step me, or it's yourz!





Come on (come on)
Take it back (take it back)
70's style (style)
I'll do, anything
All y'all old school Studio 54ers
That's, my, word!

There's nothing in the world that I won't do
I'll give my world to you, if you want me to
I'll do, anything
That's, my, word!

O.D.'n on this one fleein, all eyes seein
Dominant supreme being, face the mental
Deep concentration break the point on a pencil
Keep my cliches out your dental, capiche?
Shit that I been through is cause for parental
Discretions no question my Westside Connections
L.A. Confidential, world don't stop
'less it's mental, Staten residentials, you wit it?
Wu-Tang, Forever and a day, 'til I'm old and decayed
I'm commited; look ma, we did it
Top of the the world, tell it to my firstborn
And my baby girl, did it my way, take the low ride
On the highway, out the sunroof, yellin
"Thank God it's Friday!" Show a nigga love
If he got my sound pull the plug, he's not underground
Call him mud, when I flood the airwaves
Household and stairways (rainy days)
Waiting for these paydays, think not of the ends
If I got twenty, my brother get ten
Now let the madness begin motherfuckers!

There's nothing in the world that I won't do
I'll give my world to you, if you want me to
I'll do, anything.. anything.. anything.. anything..
There's nothing in the world that I won't do
I'll give my world to you, if you want me to
I'll do, anything..
Yo, yo, yo!

We got love for those with love for us
Baby you can look but don't touch, I'm fried off the dust
And plus, the only thing I trust is a fund
Ain't no fun, just paranoid niggas totin guns
In apparel, keep us camouflaged in the shadows
That's where I bring this tale that you never get to tattle
Obliterate the tri-state, and the crime rate
Tell them swine niggas fly straight, you can call it fate
And if it ain't mine, call it fake, bottom line
End the case, spoonfeed the track just a taste
Of the side dish, soup of the day, I come Wright like N'Bushe
For them Dead Presidents
Fuck what you say, and he say, and she say, and they say
Vacate the premises, caught up in the melee
Sentence this song, to twenty-five years hard labor
In the system, where it takes the form of my wisdom
Respect mine, take my time and protect nine
Next on the frontline, Mr. Meth
No more no less, what you see is what your ass get
Set it off I suggest

There's nothing in the world that I won't do
I'll give my world to you, if you want me to
I'll do, anything.. anything.. anything.. anything..
There's nothing in the world that I won't do
I'll give my world to you, if you want me to
I'll do, anything.. anything.. anything..

Not a problem that I can't fix
Cause I can do it, in the mix
Not a problem that I can't fix
Cause I can do it, in the mix




It's Wu motherfuckers, Wu-Tang motherfuckers
It's Wu motherfuckers, a Wu-Tang motherfuckers
It's Wu motherfuckers, a Wu-Tang motherfuckers
It's Wu


Reunited, double LP, world excited
Struck a match to the underground, industry ignited
From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth
Wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf
Scatting off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily
Tragically, that style deteriorate rapidly
Uncompleted missions, throwing your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up if you mastered addition
Where I come from, getting visuals is habitual
You're more safe walking on hot coals in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall, formed a mural
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it was plural
Rhyming while impaired, dart hit your garment
Pierced your internal streamlined compartments
Just consider the unparalleled advantage
Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage


Bitchass niggas counterfeit the funk
I smoke the bead of the skunk, tree top of the trunk
Moonshine drunken monk, your head get shrunk
Your treasure sunk, I be fucking bitches by the chunk
My name black, you worms wanna play in my dirt
Bitch stop, my Momma serve free lunch from the church
I cum like a thousand doves
Bitch you quiet at the bus, making no fuss, I gots tough love
Unglove the noose, watch a nigga transfuse
Dirty add to the fuse, heavy at the booze
I don't walk, I get carried
Gold and platinum Frisbees on my wall, looking properly
But comely, I U.F.O. you Wright Brothers
The Indian that sold Manhattan to the white man
My grandfather, stepped up and get knocked right the fuck out
Come to the cook-out, dirty bitch at the mouth
You scared, run around like a plane about to crash


Wu-Tang motherfuckers
Wu-Tang motherfuckers
Yeah and RZA


The Riddler, funny bone tickler, freak Caligula
Bigger dick sex enigma, pistil fertilize your stigma
Stinkbox order from Pink Dot
MCs get stuck on ink blots, AirSound plug to the sinkbox
Wu-Tang Incorp. take your brain on spacewarp
Talk strange like Bjrk, great hero Jim Thorpe
How can I put it, life is like video footage
Hard to edit, directors, that never understood it
Too impulsive, my deadly corrosive dosage
Attack when you least notice through explosive postage
I don't play, the rap souffle saut for the day
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig A Leg Leg Arm Head
Spread like plague, we drink Hennessy by the keg
I got the golden egg plus the goose
Eighty proof Absolut mixed with cranberry fruit juice
Ginseng boost, I got your neck in a noose
Keep my money wrinkled, the rap star twinkle killer instinct
Sixteen bar nickel sell more copies than Kinko
Grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us
And we return like Jesus when the whole world need us


Is it appetite for destruction?
Slap a murder rap on this production
I touch something, trust nothing
Iron Lung/Twisted Metal
I see 'em ducking my dart gun, busting from every angle
Worldwide total carnage, the sickest flow
That be codenamed Agent Orange, killing you slow
It's only right you pay homage
To those that's 'bout to blow like that shit up your nose
Solid as a rock when I strike target
Verbal be screaming on you like a drill sergeant
Herbals got me where I wanna be right now
Don't know the time
Check the hour on your sundial, watch me shine
Drunk off of cheap wine
Each line be on point when I speak mine
On behalf of my crew, SUUUUUUUUUUU, Enter the Wu
36 more deadly Chambers to take you through


It's Wu motherfuckers
Wu-Tang motherfuckers

 Oh yeahhhh, ahhh, aiyy yeahh yeahhhahh aiii
 And RZA...






Three young cats strapped with gats decided to ride out one night
The in-flight drug used to induce the hindsight was dust
The moonlight was robust but they couldn't see the beauty in it
Their duty in it was to carry out another senseless killin
Senses and feelings distorted they boarded their vessel Nessel
Discreet in crotches and underneath seats they tuck heat
To complete the mission they had no decision in
No longer do they use our light and dark hues to create the vision in our towns
But now they red and blue override our brown skin
We've been conditioned to let off them rounds when we see another color rag
Or, hear another brother brag about what set he claimin
Poverty, drugs and poor education should be the target
But we won't stay gamin that
We'll kill and maim another cat like there's no shame in that
Like there's fame in that
We hang out them car windows and bust them slugs
In the name of genocide in disguise, so we don't take blame for that
But if there's honor amongst you thieves in life
Then what the fuck you hidin for?
Recognize your deed to trife and decide what the fuck you ridin for




(Beloved)
My vision gettin' clearer
I'm lookin' in the mirror
I'm sayin' to myself that's a fly nigga
Harlem is the city, got all my niggas with me
You know that they get busy, lets ride nigga
Dah, dah, daditty dah dee dah, daditty dah dee day
You niggas know I'm hot Rite
Dah, dah, daditty dah dee day, daditty dah dee day
You tryin' to take my spot Rite


All my fans say f..ck you in they fan mail
Cause I had they main girl on a hand-held
I go to the store they try to pop my fan-belt
Then I body 'em in the street like Cornbread Earl
Boy I'm that thorough, I'm like a pitbull
Windex in the pen to make it crystal
170 but in rap I'm a big dude
So yeah, I got bars like a Gym Room
Boy I'm that dirty
So tell the rap Jury
That tennis, The only way a nigga gon' serve me
My black Mac Bernie, I even mat suri
Shit I'm killin' the Mic Like Conrad Murray
Get ya weight up boy, you wan' hustle with it
Even my protein bars got muscle in it
Pop my trunk, Pop Yours nothin' in it
I'm Cool so hol' up, Wait a minute
Let's go


lets ride nigga
Dah, dah, daditty dah dee dah, daditty dah dee day
You niggas know I'm hot Rite
Dah, dah, daditty dah dee day, daditty dah dee day
You tryin' to take my spot Rite


Lux I'm Loaded 'bout ready to spit a verse
On hater's I unloaded be ready to get his hearse
I'm bout to send him notice If Harlem don't get him first
Send him down to unemployment cause homey gone get this work (rite)
Hot Benz, every honey is top ten
If she Hops in, then mo' than likely we not friends
Look I'm locked in, Hit you like Skelly, your top spin
First I pop, then I'm out like Pirelli's on stock rims
Flyest in the game, still applyin' the pain
Since Milk was Top Billin', and Lyte was ridin' the train
These paper thin villains get scraped and thrown in the flame
85% of rappers is fake and so is they chain
Now that's a no-brainer
36 in my Chamber
Now a moment of silence I throw a L up for Banga
Lyricist not a Singa
Don't ever forget its Gangsta
Ladies they get the thumbs up coppers they just get the finga
(Beloved)

Play the bench, the starters is stayin' in
My thinkin' cap on, I'm 'bout ready to raise the brim
Been bathin' in the money so, honey, the famous win
I got enough fans, ain't lookin' to make a friend
Bad news for niggas with rap moves
The facts prove I'm way up in the stat pool
If cash rules, the bread good, then you fast food
Thought I left, but I'm right on 'em like tattoos
Mirror on the wall, who's the flyest of all?
Maybe the monologue, or fancy designer clothes
Buyin' out the bar for baby behind the bar
So you can tell them niggas retire, I'm on my job
They want me as a martyr, drop the hem on a mama
R.I.P. out to Huddy and light a candle for Harlem
Bring the niggas that knew me and bitches that love me truly
100 bands in the box and bury me in my Gucci


My vision gettin' clearer, I'm lookin' in the mirror

|Intro: Treach (Method Man)|
And y'all thought it was over
(Nah nah it ain't over 'til the fat bitch sings my nigga)
We ready to Rock & Roll God damn it?
(Fuck Yeah)
Dirty Jers'/New Jerusaluem
(Shaolin)
Naughty by Nature motherfuckers
(Wu-Tang my niggas)
Grab your hat bitch
(C'mon!)

|Hook: Method Man|
Dum-dum-dum there they go (x4)

|Treach|
Gettin the realism, statin' the great prism
Journalism, the Moses writin', graffitti on the state prison
Hard to steal, last year, slash a pop hit
Hate related, he's the closest that I lost since Pac (2Pac)
Got the Glock blown, ready to Rock & Roll
Give me a shot that go up the most
Cop the blow, nock us no
Finger fuck the fair place, that's in the stairway
Gut a motherfucker, gotta die to get airplay
If I can't spray the airwaves, like a great AK
You stay where you lay babe, "fuck you" is what I dare say
Hatin' niggas cuz it ain't passion for rappin' or axin'
So sell extortion and jackin', what's happenin'?
What's that? The clappin', they'rekidnappin' Sergeants and Captains
I'll be mackin' and actin' like a nigga scratchin' for super passion
(Blap! Blap! Blap! Blap! Blap! C'mon!)

|Chorus: Treach (Method Man)|
Rotten and dazed cuz I may not be here tomorrow (eye-ee-eye, eye-ee-eye)
World feel the sorrow, click clack, blah blah blah bloaw yo
Bullets in, barrels off, urban apparel
Like I told you before, click clack, blah blah blah bloaw yo
Ready to Rock & Roll (bum bum bum bum bum) {Ready to Rock & Roll}
Ready to Rock & Roll (bum bum bum bum bum) {Ready to Rock & Roll}
Ready to Rock & Roll (bum bum bum bum bum) {Ready to Rock & Roll}

|Method Man|
M.C.'s have the right to remain silent
Everything you say can and will be held against y'all punk muh'fuckers
And Mef can only trust ya as far as I can see ya
Me need ya? That'll be the.. day, ya bustas
Son suffer, the consequences, for askin'
Competition get an ass kickin' so tremendous
I throw my draws in it
Who representin' for The Projects tennants since Day One?
Shit is gettin' deep out here, run your garments son
Like niggas when the police department come
Yes y'all, Mef y'all, stank ass an' all
I'm too off the hook it don't make no sense to call
1-900-Eat-shit, I get get my cobra cock
Might death blow, close your eye

Chorus

|Redman|
Ready to Rock & Roll, I lock your load
I blow the block some mo'
Undercover like sellin' cops some blow
Bring a pain killer, my name ring a bell
Orangutang, I throw it up like gang members
Crunk as fuck, walkin' in with the pump tucked
Punks get it nigga, we even jump sluts
How 'bout a dump truck sellin' 2 for 5
I ride with tools I made out of school supplies
I show you it's not serious for y'all
Trouble, I got a phone on my wrist to call (bubble)
You niggas know when you pissed 'em off
I turn gorilla with football equipment on
Cla-cloaw-cla-cloaw, I'm 'bout to tap ya foul
Danger, when the last Rotten Rascal out
Hang up, phone calls ain't gon' happen now
An' I'm straight facin', you niggas can't ask around

Chorus x2






Go head..


Give me all Gucci colors, my niggas get real for brothers
We idolize big lines and nines
Jumping out of big joints live, projects
Lot of objects, front if you want, you gon' die
Lex with a sawed off, Killah gonna tax him in the Waldorf
All bloodhounds, pop, show it off
Actin' like that money ain't live
Built it from the getty-up, New York City gonna fry
Aiyo, son, I take mines, rape lines
Yeah, I'm realer than Rikers who orchestrate great crimes
Jump out the Lex', lookin' zesty, real Nestle
What, picture nigga, except bless me
God, I'm high-powered, gun of the hour, crafted Flowers
Give it the blend, double it, and blow like the Towers
All ya'll need to take showers, can't take what's ours, pa..
Been sellin' crack, been sellin' crack
Been sellin' crack, livin' the black
Revealin' how we flip that, strip cats
We write rich raps
Help out the body
Me, similar to the Gotti story
I'm kinda young, son, a fly forty
The Reverend cold shittin' on shorty, did it to shorty pop
And gave him like ten in his jaw piece
Remember this sayin': "Staten Island Gun Slayers"
It's mayors, all gauges, minimum wage the raises..


...like to Rock..


Niggas be killin' me, actin' like they ain't feelin' me
Knowin' they bustin' them guns with my artillery
Usin' my words as if it's his and hers
That's that shit that make me not wanna pass the herb
The fake artist, I'm coming Razor Sharp regardless
I bump lah, sowed of liquor, light and spark
Make it crunk live, the dirty dirty try and serve me
Like black folks in scary movies: you die early
Tony Toca, Meth Tical, vida loca
Esta loca, if she think I eat the chocha
Ma, toss the, smoke ya, win free (Winfrey) like Oprah
And un-hoast that roast, your meat, for the butcher
Licky lost ya, don't even come a step closer
When I approach a track, I slam like my culture


Chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that


GZA told you it's a "Cold World", where ya heat at?..


...like to Rock..


Hots on the shit, just so we can lock horns
Throw a package in the streets, get the block warm
Something happens when we meet, hit the block strong
Get it poppin' in your face, taste the popcorn
Now that we back on track, can't lose
My back gets huge, bitches Moulin Rouge
The way I move, the Cadillac, so smooth
Battle rap improve shit, light the fuse
Bruised off the booze liquor, doozy kicker
The dynamite style, shinin' lights still flicker
Wu-Tang stickers is a nuclear reaction
Tony Touch scratch the table, RZA on the back end
Pure, the talent, yes, yours truly
The brand combination of jazz, class and beauty
Here to do my duty, up another notch
The gospel according to rap is mega watts
Agenda never stop, dead center, mega hot
Go mop it up, go cop it when it drops..


Woman, you sure like to Rock..


Haha, come on over here..




Yeah... yeah (come on ride in my rodeo, come on ride in my rodeo)
This one of another one of them nasty M-E-F joints, come on, come on
Come on (come on ride in my rodeo, come on ride in my rodeo)


To all the chicks with they asses thick
Out the whole click, she the baddest bitch
Dose-doh, round your partner, switch
Clan in Da Front, we be starting shit
No don't trip, dog, spark 'em, quick
Holla when a real nigga talkin', trick
We got grip, but we ain't spendin' shit
You and your friends, stop pretendin' trip


Let a nigga get nut pushed, better yet let a nigga get some head
I work 'em, work 'em or feed 'em, burp 'em, then jerk 'em, instead
I get my nuts pushed, on the bottom to the top of your gums
I feel your slurpin', slurpin, I'm skeetin' and squirtin' your tongue
And I got about 5 grand, but I won't be spendin' a dime
See cuz overspendin's a crime and I can't be spendin' my time
If you get your guts pushed, could be of cuz Luda and Meth
Could be of cuz we do it best, could be of cuz we screw 'em to death


Come up out of them dirty clothes (bend on over and touch them toes)
Uh-oh, we-oh, we-oh! (Come on and ride this rodeo)
(Meth & Luda we lock and load) Round your partner, now dose-doh
Uh-oh, we-oh, we-oh! (Come on and ride this rodeo)


I wonder where about five bottles of gin, models that wanna swallow
And wobble, gobble again, tell a couple of friends
I slap that ass, bitch, take a look and see what you got in
Cuz I've been schemin' and plottin', to have you breathin' and stoppin'


What we talkin' bout? Pussy poppin', car hoppin' women
See 'em watchin', clockin', pigeons
Flockin' Luda they jockin', lightin' buddha, and boots is rockin'
Nameless hoes, take 'em brainless with painted toes
Famous, she code, twerkin' pussy, hurtin', workin' that pose


They wanna raise that pussy tab, price and position
Enticin' these women, given the proper juice
Life that they livin', hope that they double deuce
Shifted ass cheeks, last week and Ludacris is backseat
Afraid so, ask son, taste them


Now watch me, dog 'em, freak 'em
Out every weekend, she puttin' APB's on my dick
I keep on bettin' and breathin', where's my pants, I'm leavin'
I'm speakin' facts, mamies creepin' and they cheatin'
They even sleepin' with mats, some be eatin' that cat
I'm teasin', indecent expose, Method be tweakin'
Keep pussies leakin' through pantyhoes, marijuana smell on my clothes
This evening, these bunnies got me on swoll, I bust and reload
Honey, break out the 'dro and give me some mo', on the rodeo






Play the fuckin' track!
Play that fuckin' track! Oh there it is
Limp Bizkit! DMX (what?)
Redman (that's right y'all) Method Man
We just keep on rollin baby
Are you ready...
Are you ready...
Are you ready?


Now move in, now move out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now
Breathe in, now breathe out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Uh!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (What!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Uh!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Tell me what you gonna do now (C'mon!)


Now I know y'all be lovin this shit right here
L-I-M-P, Bizkit is right here
People in the house put them hands in the air
Cause if you don't care, then we don't care
See, I ain't givin' a fuck, quit pressin' your luck
Untouchable, branded unfuckable
So keep me in this cage, until you run that mouth
Then I'mma have the plague, and break the fuck out
And then we'll see who's left, after one round with X
And what am I bringin' next? Just know it's Red and Meth
So where the fuck you at punk? Shut the fuck up!
And back the fuck up, while we fuck this track up!
Are you ready, are you ready, are you ready?




Oh what, y'all thought y'all wasn't gon' see me?
Check my, dangerous slang atrocious
When I let these nuts hang, focus, it's Wu Tang
What the fuck's a Hootie and the Blowfish?
I wave my Black Flag at the roaches
Who approaches, these twin, supersoakers
Who have poisonous darts for culprits
Too late to get your blow gun un-holstered
You're left buttered up and lightly toasted
So what, I drink and smoke too much
So what I cuss too much, shut the fuck up!


Now when we roll, you motherfuckers tuck in your gold
Cause for the platinum, I'm jackin' niggas up in limos
It ain't nothin, for bullets to unbutton your clothes
Description, yellow male, tissue up in his nose
You bitches, swing the vine on the baboon nuts
I'm hairy as hell, outta hell and tattooed up
I'm a dog only fuck in the bathroom, what?
In high school, I dealt only with the classroom sluts


My name is, Johnny, Donnie, Brasco
Tuck the gat low, cut your cash flow
Yell if you want money, funny
A hungry dummy snatch crumbs from me
Docs are hot, mix bodies in the mosh pit


And I'm the D.O., you lookin' at the raw invented
On Friday, I spit 35 to 40 minutes
Smell up the bathroom like Craig paw was in it
Endin' up on your back, Wu swords up in it
Anyone can match me, I crack 'em all to Guinness
Fuck how many thugs players and ballers in it
Brick City, Shaolin, better call us sinners
Boys that'll run up in your wife, maul and spill it




It just don't get no darker than that kid with the Parka
Bald head with the boots who shoots to make it spark
Now I'm a fair nigga, but ain't nann nigga
Quicker than the hair-trigga, so if you dare nigga
It'll be like your man tryin' to hold yo' brain to yo' head
But you'll be shittin' on yourself cause you, already dead
And at the funeral you won't need a casket
Leavin' just enough of him to stuff in a basket
A tisket a tasket, I really need my ass kicked
My moms never let me forget, that I'm a bastard
I ain't never been shit, and ain't gon' be shit
That's why I take shit, whenever I see shit
It's just that D shit, D's short for do what I wanna do
And that's what I'm gonna do, right here in front of you
And I'll be runnin you and your man straight up out
While y'all niggas ain't runnin' a fuckin' thing but yo' mouth




You, wanna mess with Limp Bizkit?
You can't mess with Limp Bizkit?
Because we get it on, every day and every night
See this platinum thing right here? well we doin' it all the time
So you better get some better beats and uh, get some better rhymes
You really, really, really wanna get shit started
Well people everywhere just get retarded
Get retarded, get retarded, people everywhere just get retarded!




That's right baby!
Watch out punk!
Limp Bizkit, DMX, Method Man, Redman and Swizz Beatz!
Where the fuck you at?!
Bump that shit! Bump that shit! Bump that shit! Bump that shit!
Ruff Ryders! Punk!




Coach, put me in the game
I'm for real, for them peoples tryna to put me in them chains
Whatever the topic, let's put it in the frame
We can even load it and cock it and put it in they brains
I'm saying, some rappers do it for a chain
Kill yourself, I know killers that'll do it for some change
These veterans is slipping, they ain't doing it the same
I don't slip, set a pick and put a shooter in your lane
Precise, 'bout shoot them at the range
But I ain't tryna shoot it with you rappers
I'll just shoot it at your dame
Y'all never should have threw me in the game
Found a new word for weed, that was so mean
I threw it in my name


My song banging loud on the block like arms spraying
The law hating, warring like Blacks and Caucasians
God versus Satan, I'm laying in the dark
With the Mossberg waiting, letting off first basing
Slim from the cotton club washing a scrub
Deuce high when he cruise by, spotting his love
Hold the mic like a .38 muzzle to snub
This flow, call it OJ blood on the glove
Above rap, capital Gs speak on the facts
Please believe that, meaning that I keep it a stack
He's back, he a beast on the track
The only time that I go soft is probably with your freak in the sack
Feel the bass make sure he shake, murder verse, first forty-eight
Manslaughter, nearly caught a case
I crack heads more than base
Stack bread when I orchestrate, that said y'all the bass


No matter what the weather, we be getting our cheddar
So we can have a better tomorrow
Oh, money, cars, superstars, getting ours, working hard
For a better tomorrow


I seen niggas sniff coke through a crazy straw
Come out they shirts sweating bullets with the Bobby Brown jaw
Dry mouth, grinding back and forth plus he's steaming a Newport
We all holding the torch
Few staircase murders, some burners don't blam right
Guns that kicked around the wall you better stand tight
Full of X, AKs, whiling in lobbys, bulletproof PJs
Fuck around and get spunned like the DJ
CSI traumatized by viewing the instant replay
SpongeBob niggas get scars nigga
I'm off style in any section of the hood I'll pull your car nigga


No matter what the weather, we be getting our cheddar
So we can have a better tomorrow
Oh, money, cars, superstars, getting ours, working hard
For a better tomorrow


See ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
So you rather pursue death than admit defeat
See ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
So you rather pursue death than admit defeat


I used to be so narcissistic, park the whip and spark the biscuits
Spit hollow tipped shells at the Narcs with quickness
Live to tell the tale cause only God's my witness
Been a long time, change gonna come son, I'm optimistic
I hold the steel like Ron O'Neal
Super fly, do or die, Killah Hill, Brownsville
Never ran, never will, yes I can, yes I will
Put a dot upon your knot then I drill through your grill
Like a dentist, my apprentice speaks with a vengeance
Demented scientists count bodies inside the trenches
That's judges off the benches, got inches for y'all wenches
We plant those hot seeds that grow in cold winters


No matter what the weather, we be getting our cheddar
So we can have a better tomorrow
Oh, money, cars, superstars, getting ours, working hard
For a better tomorrow


See ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
So you rather pursue death than admit defeat
See ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
So you rather pursue death than admit defeat




Sound... bombing...
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ah, uh)


I was gutter when you met me, gutter when you left me
Gutter when you came back, face it, nothin' can change that
Not romance or marriage counselin', you dropped the ball, now I'm bouncin'
Find me a room, burn up an ounce in
Waitin' for my baby to call, forgive it all
On some break up to make up shit, givin' me drawers
I adore mi amore, but every time she choose to go to war
I'm lookin' at the front door


You could keep the negative's mind, please, I get the picture
The emotional sounds was different when I first split you
Claim I brought pain to the thing like King Kong
Like villains in the Western flicks, that I was well hung
So put you up on Talib Kweli and the Village of Slum
Read the book of psalms to get the miles, sing some (come on now)
And you actin' like you don't know what I came here for
It's wrong to put our spirits your drove at the front door
Affectionate smiles, so you could front more
I should call you somethin' that walks on all fours
Cuz you got a fella heated for sure, love him or delete it, it's raw
Feelin' cheated when I'm out on tour
They catch a glimpse from beyond this globe, on the same note
Cuz in terrential downpours, I keep a rain coat
And a bottle of chamborg, to let the brain flow
Pray for sun after the rain and creep the rainbow


Oh, I try and I try to stop the
Forces that go round in my head and cloud
Thought you were the one to understand me
You turned my dark skies to light
But once again you touched my hopes to him
My soulful sing, my tears start glimmin' in the rain
All and again, all and again


I really don't know what you came here for, round and round we go
Consider your bags outside the door, round and round we go


If you don't understand where I'm from
Then my heart is tellin' me you're not the one
All the games you played and now realize
You're not the one, for me to want some baby, bye-bye
Pack your bags and get to steppin'
You gotta let it go, you need to stop trippin'
I hope you don't think I'm gon' let you back in
Cuz you'se a fool




G. Rap Giacanna, I'm not the one who's born to be dissed
So let me make this clear for you, just like stones on my wrist
Just cuz the door closed, don't mean I'm on the phone wit a chick
I'm just a cat about his B.I. and let's only get rich
Straight up politickin', so where you lay your dome and be sick
Stack cake, wit food on the plate and chrome on the six
Then we can make a little fam, just us, alone in the sticks
And I can get rid of these bricks, we gone from the strip, you know?


Today, I made up my mind, to get away
Everyday, I sit and pray, everyday, everyday






Every day, every day (round and round we go)
To get away, away, away (round and round...)




Remix, Jonell, Def Jam, Method Man, How High


All the game that you were spittin', I know that you was trippin'
Never thought to see me dippin' but I had to get missin'
I'm tired of you stressin' me, why don't you let it be
Comin around cussin' me, fuckin' wit me mentally
Goodbye, don't wanna see your face no more
So long, pack your bags want you out the door
Cause, every time that I play this ruggy
Time and time again it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain it's gonna rain it's gonna rain


There you go again flippin' on me
One minute we the shit next minute you shittin' on me
So what's the problem huh?
No wait, let me guess, gimme some space
And some place to get a load of your chest
No better yet you don't get enough attention at home
And when I'm gone I don't even think to pickup the phone
I'm dead wrong, now your fed up, packin' my stuff, fuckin' my head up
And I see it in your face right now you wish I shut up


I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!


If you don't understand where I'm comin' from
Then my heart is tellin' me you're not the one
All the games you played and now you lied
You're not the one, for me no more so baby bye bye
Pack yo' bags and get to steppin'
You got to let it go you need to stop trippin'
(I hope you don't think I'll let you back in)
Cause youse, a, fool


I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!


Don't waste, your time
Ya blew me once but not a second time
Now it's time for you, to go away
I packed your things nothing else for us to say......but...bye!!!


I was gutter when ya met me, gutter when ya left me
Gutter when ya came back face it nothin' can change that
Not romance nor romance counselin'
You drop the ball now i'm bouncin'
Find me a room burn up an ounce and
Waitin' for my baby to call foregive it all
On some break up to makeup shit givin' me draws
I dore mi amor, but everytime she choose to go to war
I'm lookin' at the front door


To-day I made up my mind - to get away
Every-day, I sit and pray, everyday, every-day
To-day I made up my mind - to get away
Every-day, I sit and pray, everyday, every-day


I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!






Huh, after all these years, what you said was true
The Shaolin and the Wu-Tang is very dangerous

Hahahahahah


It's the ODB kid, once again coming through your area
And I'm going to tell you one time, you gon' love this


I had to get the money, said it wasn't a choice
Die Hard's on the bars, Ladies lovin' the voice
Morphine flow, numbing your joints
Bomb a nigga like he number 81 from Detroit
Zombie life, World War Z
Antidote to your virus, your highness, the world on me
Capital G, cool as the dude from Dos Equis
So deadly, I don't make it rain, I snow heavy
Sick lane, Nic Cage how I ride with fire
Forever with bars, sort of like a lifer
With the son of anarchy, I be breaking bad
Walking dead, day dreaming of making a band
Dancing with the stars, Americans idol me
The mentalist with the Big Bang Theory


Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


The most duplicated, anticipated, validated
Urban legends in the books with the ones who made it
Highly celebrated, everything was work related
Current top 40 got the Wu deep in all their business
20 years Killa Bees, yeah, we hold the pennant
Monumental stance on the cover with my co-defendants
Drop her sentence, in remembrance
Construct these jewels so they can live through my descendants


Youngun, I can see your draws, pull your pants up
Can't even call yourself a man until you man up
And if you call yourself a fan you need to stand up
This ain't a party, it's a jux, keep your hands up
And I don't care who runs the city when the summer come
Your summer's done, Wu forever, and we're still number one


Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


Picture a nigga on the strip getting rich off the drug shit
Putting other niggas on, teaching em thug shit
Then they want stick 'em up, then they get slugs quick
Hood-type niggas always living that crime life
Jealous-ass grimy niggas seeing the limelight
Slimy old nigga like fucking your mans wife
Fool shouldn't use the word brother, he man dyke


Yo, I spin my web all across New York
Get it out in all types of ice, there's a sport
One chain, two chain, three chain, four
Niggas mouth's drop like the leaves in the fall
Tone got that WBC
I take off heavy in air balloons and land in the Fiji's
That's my bird and that's my word
You faggots keep fucking around and get curbed
(I came to town)


Forms circles like the rings of Saturn
Dust rocks and ice in a particular pattern
Then this fascinating picture has emerged from surface
A wonder of the young world with an urgent purpose
A wild fire engulfing every home
It's history chiseled and carved in every stone
A workshop where skills are learned
Handcrafted and drafted, written works the main concern
Urban center provided with a social structure
And a curious culture full of superconductors
Each stain is part of a scene with
Intricate geometric raps on a larger screen
Spell bounding, marvelous and it's surrounding
Viewpoints remain the same, it's all astounding
A place where the forgotten art is so powerful
A striking image is something that's so valuable


This one's the blackout! Three-fifty-seven to your mouth!


GZA, this is called Ruckus In B Minor
Rae, all those bad times is behind us
Ghost, put that mask on to remind us
Method Man, let 'em know who's New York's finest


Youngun, I can see your draws, pull your pants up
Can't even call yourself a man until you man up
And if you call yourself a fan you need to stand up
This ain't a party, it's a jux, keep your hands up
And I don't care who runs the city when the summer come
Your summer's done, Wu forever, and we're still number one


Still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


Now I'mma let all you motherfuckers know
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga
I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker!


My lines is like Peruvian coke, go ahead and try one
My recipe is A1 remarkable with my mixture
Rainman mathematician, this city slicker
The finest threads cover my frame, the cloths of royalty
Strive with an army of winners and no pretenders
(*One*) We live free and achieve more
But first we gotta win with no stalemate
The all eye seeing is victorious biz to the sound man


Armored trucks, tanks are bulletproof, been the truth
Loot the track, clear the booth, my thought ready, aim, shoot
My knowledge one twenty proof, let's tear the roof off
Let's spray, M-A-S-T-A
King I Love-Love club, pack stadium rock
I hold the mic snug, split a slug
Black ninja, mask and gloves


Still number one, still number one





All you hoes, be cryin for these bitches
All you niggas, be cryin for these hoes

Are you ready? Are you mad inside?
Got you strapped down to your seats
Outta the doorway, bullets ripped, full clip
God speed, approach follow my lead
Fire winds gust, empire crush
Full thrust, fall in the hole, roll wit the rush
Untouchable chunk of earwax and soul
Sound waves slay out the bat cave smoke
My belly-full prance dance, avalanche quote
Down slope, elegant as Fantasia
Killer whale tale inhale, black male from Asia
All out the wood works, hood shirts and wizards
No match, unhatch, the rap is rigid
In the shaft, shotty cocked, hip hop to the limit
Nightwatch, pad mark
Sparks spin a quake nuclear blast, heavy on the cash
Gimmie what it takes NOW!!

Chorus  2x
RAGE ROCK ROLL FIGHT
BRAWL FALL RUMBLLLLLLEEE!!!


The diabolic witty, dialect's darker than Gotham City
With the possibility to stop your walkin ability
God forgive me, spark enemies with pistol grips
The missile tip's impact hit you so hard, you shit through your dick
Official scripts strikes when physical hits
You physical bitch, watch for the imperial blitz, serious shit
Submit, subject to the wreck war tone, and thought poems
Liver than WWF Warzone
Walk upon them Gotti tracks, bodies collapse
Rap for lottery stacks, shatter like when pottery cracks
Logical facts from the terror dome
Spill from the guts, trail to you ?puss? from where you bust
In God you now entrust
Dog you like hound and mutts, Pound Pups get sound struck
Clown what? You'll get drowned in the cut
While crowd round up

 (x2)


A-yo, yo;
I spit bars, travelling tremendous speed measuring far
Been busting satellites circling Mars
Verbal onslaught, bring forth physical force
Of a hundred wild niggas piled in a Trojan Horse
Thought method, set it on generic mic ethic
Professional neck shit, left foes beheaded
This music, is mind control like computer chips
Been doing this for numerous years, refuse to lose it
With turbo tactics, maneuver like a trained soldier
Hall of Fame flame thrower, take game, it's game over
Ayatollah, high roller nine totter
Mind controller, 2009 time folder
My coalition, bring the demolition
Wu-blade decision, slate the competition, wit no intermission
Spitting hazardous darts, up front like Rosa Parks
Makin million men march

 (x2)


Yo, who got next? Meth got next
I chin check, all these MC's line em up god, I go Jihad
Declare holy war, it be hard to dip and dodge
Police squads trying to bogard, we rip and rob
The boulevard ain't safe for your kids, that's how it is
In the ghetto, we ain't scared to death, but scared to live
So Goldy, mosey to the spot, get that moldy
Rusty-ass .38 Special, niggas owe me
Slowly I turn, face the one and only
Naughty By Nature, I Do My Dirt All By My Lonely
Ask Pretty Tony, when I got a bitch I keeps a bitch
36 Chambers, Enter at your own risk
Take that watch off and tuck your necklace
City never sleeps, streets is restless
Rap style'll slave you, when you least expect it
Pull the plug on your respirator, leave you breathless
Wu-Tang forever and a day, better warn your boys
I deploy battleship rap, seek and destroy

Chorus 2x




Yo yo, enta, enta, enta, enta yo
It's the synical, lyrical rap individual
On my death bed I spit sick flows that's critical
I'm not a fan of this, I'm a mic vandalist
Thug therapist, my clan's too original
My slang bang to wax, words that's visual
Too digital for y'all common street criminals
Who wanna come test, lick the sweat from my genitals
We can get off the mic and get a little physical
I was born to rock since they cut my umbilical
Cord, I swing swords, behold the prolifical
Rhyme writer, hip-hop provider, prize fighter
Live wire, quick to set the mic on fire
I speak legalized dope, hitman for hire
I quote murderous notes, dope rhyme supplier
Hang glide on the mic like a stunt driver
And I won't stop rockin till I retire


Yo yo yo
When it comes to the darts, I throw em
Flamethrower, blow your section-eight home to your payphone up
Grass smoker, in the cut for the lawnmower
I water, I ride the wale that ate Jonah
Over, your faced wit the black cape over
You woke up four gorillas wit a makeover
Packin a punch, asthma pump takeover
My crew boards, and the whole plane lays over
(YO YO!) You can't talk wit the tape over
Pass the pussy, get out, date's over
Back to your gray Nova that's way slower
Redline to five on the highway shoulder
Enemies say "Doc the one to play closer"
This baboon loose off the chain choker
Hardcore, ?jacore? I hate poker
But y'all spread when my bullet's daytona

 8x
Comin through, comin through duck
Run for cover (BASS!)


Yo yo this ain't ya granddaddy music, it's hip hop
Comin through your woofer like a mute kit
Hundred-thousand watts on some bullshit
I blackout eclipse wit the semi bust a full clip (CLAP OUT!)
Touch one if any, that's my complexing conquest
Now tell that shit to the court, I plead no contest
From none of y'all, please
I potty train pissy-ass rugrat for free
Keep the cake for the family and off Sarah Lee
That's how we do, powerful, movin on ya left!
Mista who, Meth, black gorilla, beatin on his chest
I suggest, you pay yo' debt or Protect Ya Neck
I suggest, you wear a vest makin all them threats
Here's a chin check that cash and splash niggas in half
Smash rappers like hash (smoke em down to ashes)
At last it's the crew that party crashes the masses
Madness wildin out like special ed classes


Straight out the gate, meet Tony
Don of all dons, behind New York King Tut wit one arm
Banana Nut Crunch last cinnamon toast with power rose
Whips dirty, dustin my bitch, FUCK PAROLE!
Peace shout he's Wallee Timb's, wild out (wild out)
We in the spot, guns go off though
Came out his mask it was Ollie North
Oh shit, what up what up Ghost
Congratulations on your new flick
Burn it dead who max the most
Word up you got the most Clarks
Bravehearts spin this
For under come down in the pale he need minutes
Told y'all before I kick doors off the hinges
Ain't no cooler and there ain't no Guiness
Money like Barry Blue, Keanu Reeves wit bench slippers
Play the PGA Tour wit Jack Nicklaus
Statues of Mary, gas that bust mercury
Sit through the biggest storm and hand out turkey


Yeah, yeah, yeah, WHUUUA!!!
That's the way I like it


PISSY ASS RUSTY ASS NIGGAS!!
(0-7-1-0-3) 1-0-3-0-4




Visual, visual, JB
Yo, Ye, what up? Raekwon


You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened I was floating, you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dining in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, patent leather
Playing the field, trying to outslick Baretta


You see, my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going? That's what nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love


I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool, tryna be cool, what you expect me to do?
I'm just tryna find, find, find this sweet love of mine


I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love


Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said "Yo what's your occupation, crazy rhyming?"
Listen to Wu-Tang, trying suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon
Stunting in a high top Louis', shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
Next show they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rocking like this 16 years old
The hard drums and the Wally's something that caught me
I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rocking the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top, old school bumping to Cash Rules
No question we the reason why the summer's blazing
Then say, "You looking good fly coloured Asian"
Raw I give it to you, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia
Until she caught me getting numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love, sweet love of mine




Why can't I find you, love of mine?
When you're standing in front of my face
Oh why, I must be blind
How did I let you get away?


Leave it up to the most high, sitting in a ghost fly
Chilling with two of my brothers
We both live on deck grabbing 'em on set
This is how we roll in the business, she a go I'mma go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month baby girl, just call me up
Waking up resting in cold sweats
Thinking of this bitch, the videotapes, even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost, I know I'm going crazy, I can't floss
Me, my lady left my homies it's all baloney
Just like rocking the old Pony's
So when I'm chilling, I'm just lost no more feeling
I need my honey in my life get that feel me
Take your time, readjust and ya you shine
My runaway love didn't mind, come on






Oh, oh, oh, come on, come on, come on
Mutha what? Muthafucka
That's right, all day, all night
Come on, get down, yes y'all and
To the right beat and you can even dance
Or, just have a seating, seating
Yo, yo, yo


What it was, what it is, it's like I got a pistol
To my head, can I live? You never should of left Tical for dead
Never that, be careful what you wish for
Today's your day to get yours
Blowin' up the spot from the sixth floor, bent off
Come and get your on smoke on, fish funk to choke on
Go 'head, blaze a pound of that bullshit we both on
Take it the 'source', 'hip hop quotable', of course
I'm pullin' out my 'roots', to breathe in my 'black thought'
Let's be honest, I break a spirit, if she break a promise
They act just like they momma's, now what that got to do
With the price of rice in China
Or why these gold miners raise the price on they vagina
Now frankly, I'm official, New York Yankee
You can blame the radio stations that's trynna yank me
And jerk the Jabber Jaw shark bitten flow
Go 'head, test the water, my friend, stick in your toe


Rush, the colisseum, rush, the dance floor
Rush, the limosine, rush, don't let go
And jerk the Jabber Jaw shark bitten flow
Go 'head, test the water, my friend, stick in your toe
Whoa-ho-ho, let me like, solo with the flow
Whoa-ho-ho, promoter better pay me at the door
Whoa-ho-ho, what the fuck y'all think I'm flowin' for
If I move to quick, oh, you just don't know


The sound echoed through the neighborhood and vibrate
Circulate eruptions throughout the tri-state
The wise they attract to it, cuz it's magnetic
Those slow kids, stuck on the block, they don't get it
But, they don't wanna set it, track on immedietly
Quick fast, clock tick to the blast machine
The bugged out, they scatter when the lights on
We raid those local spots, til we turn the mics on
Rollin' with the talent, the beats, and rap verse
The crowd get excited, with the heat and clap first
Must of had a hot hand to go in his waist band
Set he had to lick a shot for a top notch Clan
Multiple swordsmen, blade sharp
Rip through your heart, M.C.'s, want no part
For any type of conflict, or nonsense, then we respond quick
It get thick, The Problem, goes beyond sick




Let the record show, never test my flow
Never tested positive for blow
Got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffin'
Soon as muthafuckas get dough, they act different
But not Nixon, let the pot call the kettle black, but not in my kitchen
And y'all fixin', to be on milk cartoons missing
In the Double XL, Supreme Clientele
Since then I have no birthday, my sign's not for sale
If I had a dollar, for every time M.C.'s tried to holla
Brag about dough, and pop they collar
I'd probably be a zillionaire, like, 'fuck rapping and rappers'
Cut the drama, we don't like the way y'all actin'
Eat, drink and smoke Mary, Mr. Meth's rated X
By any means necessary (come on)
It ain't easy being greasy, in the main event now
Catch me on your Pay-Per-View TV






Yeah... (oh my god-god *repeated throughout*)
Staten Island niggas, forgotten borough, the most thorough
Oh shit, haha, the tri-boro, hahahaha
Fuckas... yeah... come again, what?
It's M-E-F, bitches, say it with the Meth, niggas


When I'm on the come up, ain't no telling who gon' get done up
On the highway to heaven, with they thumb up
I'm far from a dumb fuck, I'm a mack
Just like them dumptrunks, I hold alotta weight on my back
See I'm, already pumped up, I'm ready to shine
It's Mr., cover of Blender, who ready to grind?
And I still got it, I repeat, I still got it
And any artist that trash talk, is still garbage
How critics gon' think I lost my skill
When in fact, ya'll all been programmed and lost your feel
Please believe, I'm still grimey, try me
And I remind ya'll muthafuckas why Def Jam signed me
M-E to the Tizzy, H-O to the Dizzy
To see me, it's something like pimpin', it ain't easy
It's something like pimpin', it ain't easy
To see me, it's something like pimpin', it ain't easy


Yo, I stash money like a crooked banker, casablanca
Ninety-six, crack cranker, back shot, ass spanker
Get head, then I thank her, for blessin' the God
Pull a blunt hard, for my jail niggas on the yard
Think like Master Farrad, die hard, La's God
I need currency, cash, eagles in the credit card
Co-starred in cocaine, like, couldn't get my brain right
Robbin' niggas smokin' and fuckin', in the same night
Jumpin' on the train, like, talkin' how we did it, kid
And my niggas caught a body, then me and my niggas slid
Blue coats came, we hid, inside a pyramid
Unseen, as a real Egyptian king
Asiatic, doing mathematics, guns is my bad habit
Try'nna civilize a savage, rest on, every sabit
LaSon, like my coke white as a unicorn
Word is bond, everyday got a new uniform
I want it all, never fall, fuck that, forever war
I need a mansion and my closet gotta look like a mall
It's Darkman


It's a new day, new way, new rules, new school
New pay, new cake, new crew, new fools
Fuckin' with my safe box (all you niggas get shot)
Fuckin' with my safe box (all you niggas get shot)


I got the drop on you, don't flinch
Pop niggas like John Lynch, leave niggas in they own stench
I'm a light drinker, heavy smoker
Known for duckin' show promoters
Pass the money, over, my whole crew is ex-cons
Be alarmed, when you hear the *err-urrrrr*
It's on, Silverback niggas under the stairs
When we link up, we travel in pairs
Ya'll niggas best to beware, of the most thoroughest
Cover all aspects, four corners, you can't creep up on us
I'm takin' one for the team, deal me in
And when the smoke clear, do it again
This ain't a side show, you could die slow
There's no I in team, we all ride... yo!
The master of the ceremony, this is my testament
Homicide Housing, that's what I represent


Don't get it fucked up, drapped, that'll extra grind
When I pop up with silencers, you next in line
Swift with a nine, in conflict, prefer four-five
And we Loose Linx, can't control these Animalz of mine, now
Staten Island's back on the map, while the P.L.O. fugitive's back
Using the fact, drama in these streets you gon' see it and get used to the clap
Blockbuster movie picture, doggy, preview that
Carlton Fisk flow in a Lex, gorilla Homicide Housing
Came to collect, know the sounds, just a pain in the neck




Listen young'n, I'm an O.G., see I done mastered the flow
With creeping up slow, so chill 'fore I blow three
At your windshield, come on, dog, you know me
I raised you from a young pup, I taught you how to show teeth
And growl on a nigga, style on a nigga
One minute you so cool, then foul to a nigga
Ya'll suckas is pre-schoolers, a child to a nigga
I'm the resurrection of rap, now bow to a nigga
A little old me from Staten Island's gonna get cha
And I pack a big gun, and it weighs a grip of ton
So front like you the M.C., ain't no defeating me
I set up shop on your block and plots off strategically
Maybe it's the weed in me, nah a bottle of Henny
Quick to run up on your ass and follow with semi', muthafucka






Damn, I hate it when it rain
Ever since I came in the game
Some hated on the fame
A lot of niggas done changed
And started actin' strange
Even labels turning they backs
And started backing lames
Radio is the same, whole lotta speculatin'
These mutherfuckas defacatin' on the name
Wu-Tang, if this is where the hip-hop is
Radio lyin' then, that ain't where hip-hop live
It lives in the streets, we eat to live they livin' to eat
I'm fed up, that nigga rides in 'em, givin 'em sleep
R.I.P., make me the king of all I see
And when death call I'm good I got call ID
See it was clan in the front, now they just gon' front
Like my joints is on proactive, and they just don't bump
Then niggas gon' say I lost my skill
When in fact they all been programmed
And lost they feel, fo' real


They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say


Damn, another artist chokes again
They ain't cut as close as him or even broke the skin
See how niggas ain't yo friends, when there ain't no ends
Don't care who the case offend, don't underrate my pen
I got what it takes to win, while ya'll are thinking I'm trash
Loving the taste of success and this drink in my glass
Watch 'em cosign that whack shit, give it a pass till it's gone
Quicker than Red, can't get rid of them crabs
When they're wrong, call the cops, they credibility's shot
It's time to learn, what hot really is and really is not
Off brain niggas, Meth gonna let 'em know off top
Don't get smacked on dvds, trying to show off Glocks
I can't stop cause my enemies plot, or cause the cops want me
Shackled and locked inside the penalty box
And while they waitin' for my shit to flop
They gettin' pimped like hoes
Sellin' they ass just to get my spot, come on man




Ask Miss Hill, half these critics ain't got half this skill
Often so hungry that they have to steal
If I didn't have my deal, and didn't have this mass appeal
Then I'm back up in that trap, swingin' crack it's real
And that ain't worth the time, so search and find a new nerve
And here's three words: stop working mine
It take a lot more to hurt my pride
Jerk my vibe more than media lies, cry when dirt dog die nigga
The last album wasn't feeling my style
This time my foot up in they ass but they feelin' me now
Cause Tical, he put his heart in every track he do
But somehow y'all find someway to give a whack review
It ain't all good, they writin' that I'm Hollywood
Tryin' to tell you my shit ain't ghetto and they hardly hood
Come on man, until you dudes can write some rhymes
Keep that in mind when you find yourself reciting mines






Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah (Yeah)

Radio is the same, whole lotta speculatin'
These mutherfuckas defacatin' on the name
Wu-Tang, if this is where the hip-hop is
Radio lyin' then, that ain't where hip-hop live
It lives in the streets, we eat to live they livin' to eat
I'm fed up, that nigga rides in 'em, givin 'em sleep
R.I.P., make me the king of all I see
And when death call I'm good I got call ID
See it was planned in the front, now they just gon' front
Like my joints is on proactive, and they just don't bump
Then niggas gon' say I lost my skill
When in fact they all been programmed
And lost they feel, fo' real

Chorus: 
They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say
They've got so much things to say right now (Yeah)
They got so much things to say (Yo)


Damn, another artist chokes again
They ain't cut as close as him or even broke the skin
See how niggas ain't yo friends, when there ain't no ends
Don't care who the case offend, don't underrate my pen
I got what it takes to win, while ya'll are thinking I'm trash
Loving the taste of success and this drink in my glass
Watch 'em cosign that whack shit, give it a pass till it's gone
Quicker than Red, can't get rid of them clubs
When they're wrong, call the cops, they credibility's shot
It's time to learn, what hot really is and really is not
Off brain niggas, Meth gonna let 'em know off top
Don't get smacked on dvds, trying to show off blocks
I can't stop cause my enemies plot, or cause the cops want me
Shackled and locked inside the penalty box
And while they waitin' for my shit to flop
They gettin' pimped like hoes
Sellin' they ass just to get my spot, come on man

Repeat Chorus


Ask Miss Hill, half these critics ain't got half this skill
Often so hungry that they have to steal
If I didn't have my deal, and didn't have this mass appeal
Then I'm back up in that trap, swingin' crack it's real
And that ain't worth the time, so search and find a new nerve
And here's three words: stop working mine
It take a lot more to hurt my pride
Jerk my vibe more than media lies, cry when dirt dog die nigga
The last album wasn't feeling my style
This time my foot up in they ass but they feelin' me now
Cause Tical, he put his heart in every track he do
But somehow yall find someway to give a whack review
It ain't all good, they writin' that I'm Hollywood
Tryin' to tell you my shit ain't ghetto and they hardly hood
Come on man, until you dudes can write some rhymes
Keep that in mind when you find yourself reciting mines

Repeat Chorus




Yeah!
This-this-this-this
This is an exclusive (let's go)
Mr. Meth, you're so Def, you put them other M.C.'s out to rest (that's right)
And they test (uh-huh), but they forget (yeah) how the M-E-F is so Def (let's go)


Yo, uh, come on, come on, now
Big Meth attack soon as the track come on now
Zone out, with Sean Combs and Bizzy Bone out (I see you in the club)
And by one, I'm gettin' thrown out
Mami, got her toes out, ain't one army can Blaze Johnny
Like Gwen Stefani, you know there's No Doubt
I'm trill, sick with it, it's like ill
That's the only way to explain these mic skills
On Homicide Hill, anybody asks is real
The more steel, the more bodybags to fill
Can I get, hit of that hydro, nigga
I tried to quit puffin' before, but I'm no quitter
If honey show me her buns, I'll show her my ones
If the bed rockin', keep knockin' and I'mma cum
Want some, take some, I get it crunk
Speak junk, I'll slow up your road with speed bumps


When they play this in the club (say what?)
Go and tell that nigga, bump that (say what?)
Throw your hands up, like nigga, what? (say what?)
Ya'll don't really really want that (say what?)
And for whatever muthafucka, don't like it (say what?)
Tell that sucka he can get back (say what?)
Misdemeanor and Meth in your area (say what?)
Are ya'll ready? Come on, play it back (saw what?)


You wanna front, what? Step up and get bucked
And if your feelin' lucky, duck, then press ya'll luck
Ya'll got me effed up, over tracks overreact
Once I start, like a bullet, ain't no holdin' me back
I'm all that and two mac's, ya'll fakin' jacks
When I cock back like Busta Bust and make 'em clap
Here I go again, who blow in like whirlwinds
Who kiss girlfriends, that kiss they girlfriends
Got to get it, and when I'm gone
Ya'll bury me with chrome, and tell hell I'm comin' home
I'm poison, see my skull and crossbones
Got aim like them kids in Iraq who toss stones
And I got drugs in my system, we thugs in the system
That put slugs in victims, Mr. M-E to F, bomb threat
As long as I ain't no game, there's no contest




Ticallion is phatter than your fattest chrome chain
I guess that should explain why I given the dope name
Ain't nothin' free, everything got a fee
How the fuck you got a car and ain't got a pot to pee?
I'mma grown man, so I do grown man things
Why take half, when I can have this whole damn thing?
It's Meth, baby, drop top, navy Mercedes
I'm number one like P.E. or Tracy McGrady
It's all good, everything I spit, all hood
And if ya'll gave me one wish, niggas, I wish ya'll would
Who John Blaze? Uh, when ya'll gon' learn huh
When I burn son, stick a fork in him he's done
And ladies love to play, like Ladies Love Cool J
For the right CREAM, the'll do anything you say
She Ice Cream, I'm caked up with icing
Mr. Sandman, come on, bring her a pipe dream




Let's work... come on
Def Jam! Mr. Meth, Missy, Bad Boy
Hitmen baby, let's work, come on
Let's work, come on, yeah
Uh, let's work... aiyo pass that nigga
Joe Hooker, I see you, let's work, yeah



Twenty seconds on the back time

I feel you're on the run
Never lived too long to make right
I see you're doing fine
And when I get that feeling
I can no longer slide I can no longer run (oh no no no)
And when I get that feeling
I can no longer hide for it's no longer fun (oh no no no)

Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same about you
And you can tell me your reasons
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same about you

What I am is what you want to be
Now that I'm not there
Took the tables away from you
It's turned and I don't care
And when I get that feeling
I can no longer slide I can no longer run (oh no no no)
And when I get that feeling
I can no longer hide for it's no longer fun (oh no no no)

Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same about you
And you can tell me your reasons
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same about you

I've said goodnight try to sleep tight
Oh, just dream of me
Go close your eyes cause I'll close mine
The sun will shine from time to time
Will you dream of me again

Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same about you
And you can tell me your reasons
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same about you
(repeat to fade)

Uh... musical clever
You know what time it is (Ooh-ahh, Meth Tical)
Yeah... what... (Hey, did you turn my mic down
Oh.. my headphone fell off.. damn..)


Death come to those who oppose
Knockin' at the door, holding a rose
In plain clothes, when the face ice cold
Lock your windows, still I come in when the wind blows
Come in slow, suddenly your eyes close
Then your body set through your soul, it rose
Turn into a black crow and fly into the internal night
That's when I also take flight
I turn into a great falcon
With mighty wings, when they flap, they move mountains
I leap on your back, like a wild fucking monkey
Eyes are blood shot red, with a growling tummy
Beat your fucking back out, like a gorilla
When I was tore, I figure my way, out the house of mirrors
I show up to a recording session, with no facial expression
I'm just there like I crept in
Escape through the east gate, return through the west ends
When the son said, I'm like the westerns beneath the moon light
And the crescent, Priest, I have a stance, that's strong
When I perform, I transform, into a sandstorm
Leaving one third of the land torn
I'm like mice, I react strange
I'm like a terratrane, I react crazy when the weather change
Then the father of a hurricane, handcuff pain
I whip tornados with iron chains
I make volcanos scream out my name
Niggas kill me, try'nna escape my wrath
Through death, don't you know, I'm crazy muthafucka, I hold my breath..


Flicks... sluggy... one time
For your muthafuckin' mind
Wu-Tang Forever, this is just the next chamber, baby
(Fish filet, fish filet) Ah, ah-ah-ah


We walking dogs, foot soldiers, fuck you all
Guns and roses, play the wall
The final curtain calls every day, all day
We hurtin' ya'll, project hallways is triflin'
Public Enemy, number one, still fightin'
The power, like Tyson
When nothing else work, start biting
Swallow up that weak shit, they writing
Spit it out, frustrated with the line
Hard for me to get it out
Intellectual, architect, bomb threat to a vegetable
Mr. Meth, you can get the left and right testicle
Step to the rear, Wu-Tang on arrival
Raised in the ghetto, singin' songs for survival
Nothing else matter, suspect chin niggas shatter
Clap a mad rapper, red dot beemin' on the blood clot, splatter
University, anniversary of terror
It's now, or it's never
Ain't no in betweens in the cold war
Can't hold it down, got a thousand that can hold yours
Starvin', pardon me, God, I get a charge
Like a human lighting rod, strike back with no regard
For the innocent, harder than the bricks in my tenements
Wu-Tang, forever and a day, we be killin' it


So patient, they sat there in the aisles and waited
For the testimony, hungry, for a statement from the one and only
Thirsty for the ceremony at and, true Wu die hard fans
Now look how we rock, make a freestyle drop, old school like the wop
My grandaddy used to do this dance called the slop
I keep it hip hop for ya'll, we don't stop
Got ladies by the flock, no safety on the Glock
Stop, look and listen when the semi auto's pop, your neck
Mock with the rope, who can match palm
I'm strong as a nuclear bomb, dangerous armed
Have you not prepared yourself, you've been warned
Gun shot to the informer, Killa Bee Swarm
Caught 'em on the corner of Lavonia
Reported missing, found him in the fetal position
Shot twice, armed with the rocket
Blind for the target, deaded on arrival
Suspenseful, kill or be killed, pass the rifle




Hanz on he yo beast
Meth lab we gon' feast
Mad now call him Cheech
Meth man got the keef
Street lights in the building
Wu bang for the children
You know the stat and we the best
Come meet these killers in the flesh


5 thousand dollars on the love sofa
Stealing public houses with them love coca
Still love the culture and them bud smokers
But to my soldiers that cross line, that loves over
See I ain't never wrote a raps over
A loss cost but a win free, 
Situation fishy like some bad chocha
Or y'all just tryna twist me like some bad yoga


Park hills you know what it is
Nowadays I got bills and kids
Like bills in that type of shit
These niggas busy tryna keep it lit
Homie lying on the smartphone
I'm tryna tell em need to stop holmes
This shit ain't bout eating babies
And have em have me acting crazy


I'm too hot and still fire baby
And 2pac is still alive baby
I love my family cuz they mine baby
They get to 
Whatever happen to them crack babies
Hello  smoking some crack maybe
And I don't know where you rappers getting your batch lately
Before you rappers, its a rap send in a fat lady




Its like my killers they on call dog
Do ya dirty call ya boss hog
Terminate em like a loss job
I see his death to all these fake frauds
I swear to god I'm so serious
Got me getting these guns if you curious
I said the stat and we the best
From killing out here to the west


Got labels calling cuz I rhyme slick
You, you never get the ring, you like a side chick
Ask berry crock where them pies trick
The dark knight and I'm back robin no sidekick
See I ain't lying when that lie lit
I touch a cloud, it only raise when I spit
I'm tryna tell these rappers when I spit
Update the app in yo Iphones like Iquick




Special technique, fuck that
Special technique of shadowboxing, Goddamn
The GZA, Goddamn
The GZA, Goddamn, pledge allegiance to the Hip Hop
Method, Goddamn, I pledge allegiance to the Hip Hop
Maximillion, Maximillion
Johnny Blaze
I pledge allegiance to the Hip Hop
Johnny Blaze
Maximillion, Maximillion


I breaks it down to the bone gristle
Ill speaking scud missile heat seeking
Johnny Blazing, nightmares like Wes Craven
Niggas gunning, my third eye seen it coming before it happen
You know about them fucking Staten kids, they smashing
Everything huh in any shape form or fashion
Now everybody talking bout they blasting, hmmm
Is you busting steel or is you flashing? Hmmm
Talking out your asshole
You should have learnt about the flow and peasy afro
Ticallion stallion, chinky-eye and snot-nosed
From my naps to the bunion on my big toe
I keeps it moving, know just what the fuck I'm doing
Rap insomniac, fiend to catch a nigga snoozing
Slip the cardiac arrest me, exorcist Hip Hop possess me
Crunch a nigga like a Nestle, you know my STEEZ
Burning to the third degree, sneaky ass alley cat top pedigree
The head toucher, industry party bum rusher
You dont like it? Dick up in you, fuck ya!


Allow me to demonstrate
That's right, you corny-ass
The skill of Shaolin, rap motherfuckers
The special technique, better go back and check
Of shadowboxing, your fucking stacks
Shadowboxing, cause your naps ain't nappy enough
And your beats ain't rugged enough, bitch


I slayed MCs back in the rec room era
My style broke motherfucking backs like Ken Patera
Most rap niggas came loud but unheard
Once I pulled out, round 'em off to the nearest third
Check these non-visual niggas, with tapes and a portrait
Flood the seminar trying to orbit this corporate
Industry, but what them niggas can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect Ya Neck, my sword still remain imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year round from June to June
While niggas bite immediately if not soon
Set the lynching and form the execution date
As this two thousand beyond slang suffocate
Amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
Cause RZA to charge niggas twenty Gs a session


When my mind start to clicking and the strategy
Is mastered the plot thickens
This be that Wu shit
I don't give a cotton-pickin' FUCK
About a brother tryna size a nigga up, I hold my own
Hard-hat protect your dome
Look at Mama baby boy acting like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa bee, that be holding down his honeycomb, lounging son
Wu brother number one, protect your neck
Flying guillotines here they come, bloody bastards
Hard times and killer tactics, spitting words plus
Semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle, hit the clutch
Shift the gear now, full throttle, time to bungee
To the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack and spitting lunghies
At a wack nigga dat, don't understand the fact
When it come to RZA tracks I don't know how to act
Real rap from the Stat, Killa Hill Projects
How to be exact, break it down
All in together now
Things are getting good looking better now
...And some other shit


Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
Sha-shadowboxing, the special technique of shadowboxing






Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck I'll fuck your ass up!


(Yo, hut one, hut two, hut three, hut!)
Ol' Dirty Bastard, live and uncut
Styles unbreakable, shatterproof
To the young youth, you wanna get gun? Shoot!
Blaow! How you like me now?
Don't fuck the style, ruthless wild
Do you wanna get your teeth knocked the fuck out?
Wanna get on it like that? Well, then shout!


Yo RZA, yo razor, hit me with the major
The damage, my Clan understand it be flavor
Gunnin', hummin', comin' at ya
First I'm gonna get ya, once I got ya, I gat ya
You could never capture the Method Man's stature
For rhyme and for rapture
Got niggas resignin', now master
My style? Never!
I put the fuckin' buck in the wild kid, I'm terror
Razor sharp, I sever
The head from the shoulders, I'm better than my competta
You mean competitor, whatever, let's get together


Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the tri-BLOW!


I react so thick, I'm phat, and yo
Rae came blowin' and blew off your headphones, black
Rap from, yo, Cali to Texas
Smoother than a Lexus, now's my turn to wreck this
Brothers approach and half step
But ain't heard half of it yet
And I bet you're not a fuckin' vet
So, when you see me on the real
Formin' like Voltron, remember I got deep like a Navy Seal


Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
I'll fuck your ass up!


Yo! I come with that ol' loco style from my vocal
Couldn't peep it with a pair of bi-focals
I'm no joker, play me as a joker
Be on you like a house on fire, smoke ya
Crews be actin' like they gangs, anyway
Be like, "Warriors, come out and play-ay!"
Burn me, I get into shit, I let it out like diarrhea
Got burnt once, but that was only gonorrhea
Dirty, I keep shit stains in my drawers
So I can get fizza-funky for ya
Murder, taste the flame of the Wu-Tang
Rah! Here comes the Tiger vs. Crane
I'll be like wild with my style
Punk, you play me, chump, you get jumped
Wu is comin' through at a theater near you
And get funk like a shoe, what!



Yeah yeah
Where my Shaolin peoples at?
Stapleton, the craziest, y'all know what time it is
Wild wild West
Now born, Killa Hill, poor to the rich man
Jungle Nilz, let's get money y'all


It be the Cess and Hennessey that make me act like this
I'm wild hit em up projects style never plead the fifth
Regardless, to the charges, chickenheads will be at court
Fightin and slicin each other to see who lies at my fort
Who woulda thought, little Shy Big Willie
Ninety-six we rollin dutches, nine-trey it was Phillies
First of the month be like Christmas to dealers
Hundred dollar sales come through the school zone area
Children at play keep the heat on the low
Little kids getting hit, projects flooded with po'
Now shorty's rockin, Versace and Donna Karan
Playin the Miss Mob Queen role knowin hon the cousin Sharon
I live the glamorous life, girl
To go from limos with Don Perignon, rich hotels


M.E.T.H.O.D. Man Sample:
"Wild, the Shaolin Style is all in me
Child, the whole damn isle is callin me"


Facing two-five to life incarcerated activated
Stressed behind a cell with no way to escape it
Holdin on, true to ock steel tryin to appeal
Be landed without a bail so let the commisary reveal
I feel it's time, for me to let this sparklin' wine
Wet my throat rockin the trenchcoat, flashin to get mine
Not hesitant, cause the Henny keeps me bent
Just tryin to make a cent, diggin pockets down to the lint
Regardless of all the charges the D's want me for
Warrant after warrant, so I avoid the law
Stapleton on the rise, twenty-seven where it lies
From day one until they none don't take it as no surprise




I'm havin suicidal thoughts cause I'm screwed up in the game
But today's thang, is to hold it down and maintain
I got thirty days until I get remanded for this gun charge
Still I'm livin large, joint hard up in the mode and
Long sexin, fishin for pre-model
I'm young black rich and dangerous, livin like I won the lotto
So nough of wine sex and dutches
Them kids know who us is
GP Wu, hundred-twenty-seven hustlers
Runnin from D's when they try to bust us
Fly crimes and gats, mainly black cops, them faggots love us
And my district attorneys wanna send me to jail
I told em, "People wanna kill me, that's why I had the nine milli
I bust em dead and not to injure
Remember what I quote
Before you, enter my center

To disinfect it you don't know me or my effin Method

Stapleton, the Wild West Park Hill
Port Richmond, Now Born, Jungle Nils
One mo' gaen - hit me with that SHIT they be smokin
Got Cali niggas loc'n, New York niggas open
John Jay phenomenon, the mega-bomb
Transformed into firearm (pow) like Megatron
You get stepped on and shit upon, I'm still calm

Y'all niggas make room for daddy, for real

We got love for those that got love for us
(Show your lust; your best bet is to roll with us)
Now go to your room (hang it up)

"Who's the knucklehead wantin respect?" -- Ghostface
{sample repeats in background of Street's intro}


Yo, yo; Never doubt the Life
(EHHHH! YO!) Yo
Who the fuck are you to criticize me?
Yo, I slap, yo, I slap dick ta ya wifey
Yo (respect, that's my word)


Another Wu tradition, Street vision, listen
All my life I've been poverty stricken
Always took what's mines, never was given
A second chance just to rap sheet a bad decision
You can't knock the hustle or the life that I'm livin
Quick to stick the clip in, blow you out position
Street juridictions, nigga, no restriction
Concrete composition for emcee's in submission
Special edition crash course mission
Push through like the task force and crush all competition
See you from a distance, dry snitchin, whisperin
Greet your man posted up like two little bitches
When you get the heart, step live or catch stitches
Or find yourself with Del, sleepin with the fishes
I got no love for fans that's fake ass niggas
I can't stand the bid when it's all in my business
Wu-Tang Forever and a day, don't get it twisted
I get lifted, I just shoot somethin from hot buscuit
These street kids, we can't lost, we terrorize you district
Leave no finger prints and no survivin witness


Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
(Yo, yo Math!)
It's them kids from the otherside "Shaolin" Worldwide
Street Life, Homocide, nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide, boo, we P.L.O
Fo' sho', if it don't flow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it don't blow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it ain't dough, gotta go
Some didn't listen 'til my gun went BLOW!


Yo, thoughts sharper than a Japanese Kitana
Ninja coma, pirahnas crack teeth on my armor
Scadalous, I ran contra-bomber, stalker like rebels of Rwanda
Death before dishonor, snake charmer, persona of one who makes drama
Godfather 4 type saga, tuckin a revolver in my Parker
Bombin unprepared for departure, might talk but strike harder
Fear the bow of the silent archer
Sure shotter, pass the rock to your starter
Poison darter, news photographers document the horror
While I bounce Shaunda with Tiwana and I from blue Honda
Honorable scholar, rockwilder, rip mic's for top dollar
Your highnes, the crowd hollar
Got your head rock, feel the brain trauma
Crowd sponser, hotter than Bahama steam saunas
The Rebel of opera, popped off the choclate and the ?gosha?
Monster truck crush you imposters


Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
It's them kids from the otherside "Shaolin" Worldwide
I.N.S., Homocide, nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide, boo, we P.L.O
Fo' sho', if it don't flow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it don't blow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it ain't dough, gotta go
Some didn't listen 'til my gun went BLOW!


I'm the four mic emcee with five mic potential
Overlooked cuz y'all can't understand what I been thru
You ain't got to love me, or even pretend to
Actin like the street, they ain't got no street credentials
Crack villians, raps be killin instrumentals
The caps pealin and slap a feelin out ya dental
Underground, sound, for ghetto residentials
Up shit's creek lookin for some more shit to get into
Got the Clan jewels as I continue
To serve you everythin on that's on the menu
With Chef John Jacob
Remember Sunz Of Man told you Wake Up?
My nigga smell the coffee, I'm too hardcore to kill softly
Come to free the mind and get the bullshit up off me
The Jedi, only use The Force if ya force me
Shaolin What? Don't get it fucked up and cross me
Rappers gettin stuck for actin stuck up and flossy
Say it ain't so! Bust the callico
Rap from the Island called Stat', here we go


Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
It's them kids from the otherside "Shaolin" Worldwide
Method Man, Homocide, nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide, boo, we P.L.O
Fo' sho', if it don't flow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it don't blow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it ain't dough, gotta go
Some didn't listen 'til my gun went BLOW!

What, yeah, I ain't playin' around
No more, man, used to have for you and shit
What, wanna stab me in my back, and all that
Yeah, word, you ain't got to say nothin' to me
When you see me in the world, nigga
What, yeah, yo, yea, yo


I knew it come down to this, you let this rap shit
Come between us, now you smellin' your piss
Showed you love on the strength of click, little bitch
Wanna switch, ride on the next nigga's dick?
Time to show you how real it can get, real quick
We can battle for your bitch or that ice on your wrist
We can do this for any price, your life's at risk
If you shit five mil, still wouldn't cop that shit
I respect no M.C. who claim they sick
With your gangsta anticts, what part of the game is this?
Ignorant simplest, life after death is a myth
Never shit where you sleep, never walk where you piss
Don't forget I was Street, before this rap game shit
Nowadays, rap niggas, be dying in they whips
Fuck a rhyme, take this back to sellin' dimes on the strip
Never in your lifetime, would you rock like this


I knew it come down to this
We used to be all right, now it's shoot on sight
(Shoot on sight, nigga)
I knew it come down to this
You fucked up homey, you switched up on me
(Switched up, homey)
I knew it come down to this
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
(You better have that chrome)
I knew it come down to this
Down to this, down to this (come on Streetlife)


I knew it come down to this, I figure I'll
Warn you first, before I let you swallow my fist
I got gorillas in the myst, with banana clips
Ready to peel when I feel you slip
I don't care how much shotties you shot, how many bodies you got
You rub me wrong, then your body will drop
I'm from Homicide Housing, where we murder the cops
Just for browsing, walk in the beat on my block
You got some nerves, changing my words
But I'm on to you fake ass nigga, you heard?
This is grown man business, stay in your place
I got big big guns, that will erase your face
I see you eyein' me, eyein' you, bite your tongue
Cuz if you speak them fight words, muthafucka, you done
I live the life, and everything come with a price
I'm only tellin' you once, I ain't sayin' *two gun shots*






Yo my nigga Jamel Simmons what the deal nigga?
(Gold D, Dig Dast what's goin down, what's goin down)
{Aight, what's goin on, what's goin on
What's the deal pa, where you headed son?}
(Yo I'm bout to go to the studio and lay smash hit
Wit my Uncle Run, boy)
{Word?} Ain't he a Reverend now, collectin plates
At churches and shit?
(He's spittin flames right now baby
He at the top of his game, right now
I'm tellin, I'm show you, watch
Youknowhatimean? He's a born again, hooligan)
Uh-huh


I'm red rum, Reverend Run, brother son, earthquakin
Industry shakin, you kiddin me? We money makin
Your money fake son, I'll call you clay 'cause you get's Play-Doh
Jamel and Joey Simmons holdin millions on the lay low
Platinum hailos, hero heads high from hydro
Hit the dime on the combo, she try to diss my rhyme flow
She ain't know we only glamorous like Phat Farm fashion
Simmons name sinamous wit this cash
It's our passion... What!?


Yo basically I'm here to rename rap, it ain't rap no more
Call it Simmons Incorporated, since '74
Lotta money in this fam, think about it
Me wit Run-D. M. C., and him over at Def Jam
Well damn, how the hell you think we livin?
How you think it feel to be a Simmons
Imagine Christmas and Thanksgiving
People wanna know why I ain't on my brother's label
If I did this whole rap game be unstable
Went over to Arista wit Mr. Davis, for the change of neighbors
It's only fair that we share those naked papers
You can tell a cat serious about rap and it ain't luck
If 20 years after his first single, his name's stuck
From '74 to '99, did novice to king, wit a million
Mc's waitin in line
Keep a barrel on this album if my man's and them rise


Now speed it up, uh


Run really make ya wanna drop, drop
Now wanna make ya go live, live
Now wanna make ya go live, live
Now hold up


Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
John-John Phenomenon, deadly but calm
Word to my born, dead by dawn
Got the right to bear arm, ring the alarm!
Another sound boy dyin, hot irons
Slugs flyin out the hardware appliance
Baby mamma cryin, sobbin and grievin
You was at aws wit them kids till they made it even
Let down ya guard, yes you did, now you barely breathin
To unaware, open season on a duck, we don't give a what
Yo best best to give it up
Sho indeed, let's Run D's mc's, they phony
Some hump free, they mad bogey
Saddle up ya horse, if the sunset mosey
Jam Master Jay deserve a trophy for this track, right?
Futuristic G past type, if that's yo girlfriend
She wasn't last night punk, little boy
Stylin mad chump, ain't no wins here
This sport's extreme, know what I mean?
Gettin royalty, +Down With the King+!!!


Crack, crack, cracks in the cradle
Cracks, in the cradle
Cracks in the cradle, cokes in the spoon
Little Boy Blue higher than the moon
Will he, will he want a weapons, will he wanted the wound
I come to school and lay down the rules
Two, two, two channel empty guzzle, brake gallons of drop
Shorty wit the forty, once sport in the dark
Co-co-corner, black as a goner
Didn't really wanna call my momma in Savannah


I spit dynamite ignite turn off lights
Recite, spit poetry type, get my squad physically hype
Get a hundred blast from Funkmaster, crush ya life
+Blast+ Time to go now, show these fake rappers the way to go down
Down With The Kings, like Smokey down wit Motown
Who wanna come and see, come and test me
Take about a million mc's to wet me
For Run-D. M. C. I let shells fly, freein the five
Wit the red eye, niggas talkin to much
Tape 'em up, leave 'em hog tied


You thinkin about it way to hard, how to get down wit the Gods
Kenny Cash, the Bronx cat, but it'll ride wit gats
Peep chicks huggin the sacks, yours scratchin the back
I'mma shark in a shack, y'all cats is feedin the fish
Now hate and feed wit clips, nigga that leave you ripped
And I'm leavin 'em dry, shit's crushed wit bleadin lips
Bet I, leave these chips, and a C. L. K
After I hang plaques in the spot wit Run, D and Jay






Get the fuck up
Simon says, "Get the fuck up"
Throw your hands in the sky (Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo)
Queens is in the back sipping 'gnac, y'all, what's up?
Girls, rub on your titties
Yeah, fuck it, I said it rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool that act shitty
In the midst of the calm, the witty


Yo, shut the fuck up
Luck said, "Shut the fuck up"
Bitches in the back like crack, get it cut up
I speak on behalf of them broads you call stuck up
Act like a man and get cocked, smacked the fuck up
Pull the truck up, Luck, you know the name
Ass out in the bleachers stay shitting on the game
I suppose what you're spitting is flames, cowards
Knew your crew was vaginal, I could smell the douche powder
Summer's Eve, I drop degrees chill
Come four by four, lose one like Dru Hill
Stay fly till you get airsick, now that's ill
Two choices, either squeeze or peel, now that's real


What the fuck's going on here? Just a minute now, hold up
Sinister wit hit the time I diminish him, finish him, roll up
When I'm in a cinematography state of mind
My rap trip, rip, flip, clip, say the rhyme
Shit, I spectacular run, hit spit bitches vernacular
Miraculous rhyme flow, back track to the Immaculate
Binaca blast nigga that's fast, son, I'll out-box you
Ladies rub the ta-tas, bras, titties and knockers on the floor
Oww! Fellas, pull your cock out
On the verge to splurge verbs for third-round knock-out
Uh, I bust a rhyme that dust frustrated rappers
Dust crush competition, lights out like the Clapper
The mic ripper, whip a nigga like a slave
Separate him from him from his fam
He don't know how to behave now
Drag his ass, bag dun for his loot
Figure me to give a nigga-y twenty-one gun salute
That's seven shots for 2Pac, seven for Biggie Smalls
Seven for Freaky Tah up in your neighborhood malls
How's that? Fat action packed rap remain tame
Pharoahe fuckin' Monch, ain't a damn thing changed


Yo, yo, get the fuck up
Funk Doctor Spock said, "Get the fuck up"
I got a bitch named Nina and I tuck her
I leave a nigga hanging like your mom's muffler
Snuff her, then my boys follow up
Respect like The Fonz, you see the collar up (Ayeeee)
I spit out a bullet, load the barrel up
I kamikaze your town off a Arab bus
Karat cut, yeah mami, pull over
I bend your pussy like for years I knew yoga
I'm too smoked up, I can't remember me
Off Hennessy, that's why I carry Mini-Me
I need fifty feet when my performance starts
I push an armored car with law and hearts
Nineteen inches, I'm not on the charts
Doc turning dark off a warning shot
Drive off and pop, six in your hood
Fuck the limelight, we rhyme tight, plus snatch the goods
Yeah, yeah, my nigga, one rhyme and you fold over
I'm hot-headed 'cause I walk with cold shoulders


Yeah, get the fuck up
Simon says, "Get the fuck up"
Throw ya hands in the sky (Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo)
Jersey in the back, jacking cars, now what's up?
Girls, rub on your titties (Yeah)
That's right, I said it, rub on your titties
Brick City gritty committee pity the fool that act shitty
In the midst of the calm, the witty


Yo, yo, get the fuck up
Yo, yeah, I said it, "Get the fuck up"
Walk through Shaolin after dark, you get stuck up
Seek and destroy, baddest boy when I'm puffed up
You know my name and Pharoahe Monch, why we came, what?
We off the chain, plus we plotting on the game, what?
Know your role, by the way, tuck your gold
And you and your mic can ease on down the road
Assholes are like opinions, everybody got to have one
Shooting in the sky trying to blast sun
Zero to sixty in a second, pull a fast one
Fifty cent flashin', they hate us with a passion
Mashin', still fresh in three-day old fashion
You're plaid, I'm stripes, together we be clashin'
Here's a Tunnel banger
Wu-Tang death penalty, the gas chamber
This gon' hurt me more than it hurts you
Slap you like the doctor the day your momma birthed you
Just so you can feel me the same way I'ma feel this world when it kill me
Even if time stands still, I'mma still be
Underground and filthy, gotta have our way like the Milky
Innocent until I'm proven guilty
Never got caught in the game of tag
Momma never kept a boyfriend with kids this bad
No justice, raider ruckus
Underground 'til we under ground
But y'all first, motherfuckers


My thugs, throw up your set
And shorties rub on your breasts
Get the fuck up out of that dress, I palm tits
You herbs get flipped like Jeeps on mountain cliffs
I'll rip through your chest, hollow-point talon tips
Double-S, double the threat, double your bet
Double up on that cash if you decide to invest
You sound like B.I.G., you sound like Jay, you sound like D
And I bet when I go plat, you'll sound like me
Shabaam Sahdeeq, injure your fleet, instant delete
Y'all crabs are weak, frail like a fiend's physique
I stay on the street, stay on the beat, stay with the heat
Stay sticking fools like you for the rocks that gleam
So toss that link, dummy, should've insured that link
Straight to Canal, appraise that link, then pawn that link
You froze up, Sahdeeq says, "Shut the fuck up"
Punk niggas get gun-butt up and tied up


Busta Rhymes is like Hacksaw Jim Duggan
Been thuggin', lovin' the way we flood jewels for nothin'
Lay it over, another ambush and take over
Yo, we don't only get money, we cut the coke and cook the shake over
You better guard your head right, especially if it's late at night
Or find your picture of your autopsy up on the website
Yo, if you ever violate my space
Fuck a fat lip, I'll leave you with a fucking fat face, nigga
Busta Rhymes the handsome, I'll hold you for ransom and some
Like the ghost of a haunted house, I'll forever live in a mansion
Bitches, snitches coming out and you know who's showing it
Like when the British civil servants pass secrets to the Soviets
Y'all niggas is seamless blends of seamless friends
Live on about (?) on a bunch of seamless ends
Colossal, me and my nigga Pharoahe Monch-o
The head honchos, getting this money like Leonardo (Do-do-do-do)
Enough substance in the roughness
Now watch it come around in an amazing large abundance
Now let me clear the smoke screen you blow, fiend
Live nigga shit that'll rebuild your whole self-esteem
Pledge allegiance to the flag of united live niggas of America
Let us control and own the fucking area
Wilding in your whip until you crash the whole truck up
And if you know what's good for you, nigga
You better get the fuck up




Yo, behind those mahogany walls
Indoor pools with steel doors, flipping eggs over in my silk drawers
While I'm charging my cell, sparking the L
Baby mother reading my mail, just that they switched seats
To another jail, and his banger is old fire
He's locked up with them dudes from the fucking Wire
That's when I passed her the bone, started to cough
And flossed all through the house, robe on, ruger out
Homebuyers see the sign, yeah ya'll, I'm moving out
In front of the crib, niggas flipped, I had to shoot it out
Thirty G, living room sets, porcelain plates
With big giant wall units, even the front grass
Saw your boy doing it, Tone Stark he'll never fall
I even put work in, under the floor
In the box with the ox, and my skeleton jaw
Tell 'em soldiers I'm in the bush if the President call


Get 'em, the'll be nothing but smooth sailing
When the heat shot, now your crew's bailing
I refuse to bow down, refuse to lay down
Go five and turn, to let the biz, all I found


Man I thought we told ya'll niggas before, Wu-Tang is for the children
P.O.'s violate your dirty urine
These dealers in the lobby of my building, ice grilling
I don't catch cold to catch feelings
I put in that work, then catch millions
If that don't work, back to stealing
Snatch me a purse, and stack reel in
Meth, I'm that dealing, millionaire, slash chameleon
I mastered the juks, one of my niggas masta, killing
Spray shots, clap civilians at the dinner table
All for the love of crack dealing
Once again the fatal, blind guillotine, for nickels
Paper rob me able, my woman is all prenatal
I got mouths to feed, nigga, and I'm the hand that rocks the cradle
Just like Hova, but I ain't trying to 'roc' the label
I'm a soldier, I stay on job, Lee Iacocca
Honey's wanna fuck and the industry fucks 'em over




I got my Ghostface on, cuz I'm a Killah
I live the Streetlife, why, I'm that nigga
Label me a beast, call me U-Godzilla
When I rumble in the jungle, I go gorilla
Step on the set, Inspectah Deck you
Dead in your face, straight RZArect you
You highly mistaken, I'm hotter than Satan
Catch me in the kitchen with blood on Chef apron
I'm known to, Cap a Don, big gun in my palm
I'm like my arm is gone, plus I Masta the Kill
Give you something, you can really feel
Got many Methods to kill a Man, if it's real, you real
The world's worse like Dirt McGirt
Fuck a bitch raw dog, then dig in her purse
Yeah that boy's a Genius, I stay fresh like I'm straight out the cleaners
I walk hard like a criminal, holding my penis





OUTSIDE HARLEM'S PARADISE

The ESU team is shackling Luke for arrest.

COP: All right, here's the plan. Triple-cuff him. Alpha team, you take point positions in the convoy. Bravo team will bring up the rear. Remember, we're clear to engage, so if he so much as looks at you funny, light him up.

COP: Copy that. You hear that, freak? I got something special for you.

LUKE: This isn't necessary.

COP: Yeah, it is.

Misty is looking on from her ambulance. She gets up and starts walking towards Luke.

PARAMEDIC: No. You need to let us finish. Ms. Knight...Ms. Knight!

MISTY: It's Detective Knight, and I'm fine. (to the ESU guy) I need a moment with Cage.

ESU GUY: Misty, we have special orders.

MISTY: Mario, come on. I was just held hostage. I just need a minute with him.

ESU GUY: All right. We'll be right here. We got your back.

COP: Clear!

MISTY (ostentatiously): You going down. It's about damn time. Cottonmouth, Officer Albini, what just popped off in there? ...Look, your friend is in the wind. They've got public enemy number one in handcuffs for the whole world to see so they're not looking for anybody else. Every officer in your detail has those modified Judas bullets. I wouldn't try anything if I were you...before I got to the precinct.
You're not that crazy, are you?

LUKE: Always.

MISTY: Take his ass to jail.

COP: Come on.

COP: All right, let's go. We're rolling.

They load Luke into the truck and drive away. The two cops in the front seat discuss him.

COP 1: Three sets of cuffs? Isn't that overkill?

COP 2: The camera's on. We need to look like we're in control.

COP 1: It's a shit detail. You'd think ESU would be in the back with those guns pointed at him.

COP 2: We've got the same guns and bullets they do.

COP 1: You know, my wife says it's the end of days, people like him popping up.

COP 2: They've been saying that since Eve bit the apple. Cage? He's evolution.

COP 1: Whatever he is, it's just scary. Makes me feel small. Insignificant.

COP 2: Insecure? You know what they say. Once you go black, you never go back. At least that's what your wife keeps telling me.

COP 1: I was fast asleep when she came home. Your daughter already wore me out.

In the back of the van, Luke easily breaks his shackles.

COP 2: Just sit tight.

COP 1: God damn it. Homeless lady. Can't they move her out of the way?

COP 1 (To the woman, over megaphone): You are in the path of a police convoy. Clear the road immediately.

Luke breaks out of the van and runs.

COP 1 (over megaphone): Cage must not escape. Fire at will!

The cops chase Luke through alleys. Luke comes to a dead end and slams into a side door. He slips through the building and ocmes out on the other side. He sees a police car drive past him and relaxes, but then hears the sound of a shotgun behind him.

COP 2: Young cops always wanna chase somebody. Me? I'd rather be where they're already going. They told us these Judas bullets can kill someone like you. You don't want to die? Don't run.

LUKE: I'd rather die than go back to prison.

COP 2: Live free or die? You wanna get all New Hampshire about this shit? Fine with me. Cop killers don't survive these streets.

LUKE: I didn't kill a cop. My problem isn't with you or yours. It's much bigger than that.

COP 2: Some people are calling you a hero for what you did. Connie's, Pop's...

LUKE: I'm no hero. But I do need to take out the person responsible for all this.

COP 2: You don't recognize me, do you?

LUKE: I've seen you at Pop's before.

COP 2: Pop cut my hair for 12 years. He didn't think he was a hero, either. He was just trying to do some right after years of wrong....I hope I'm right about you. More people rooting for you than you think.

The cop lowers his gun.

LUKE: What are you gonna tell your people?

COP 2: The truth. I had you in my sights, but you outran me. I'm getting old...Luke? You better catch that slippery son of a bitch.

Luke turns and leaves.

OPENING THEME

DIAMONDBACK'S WAREHOUSE

THEMBI WALLACE (newscast): Moments after the tumultuous events at Harlem's Paradise, fugitive and alleged cop killer Luke Cage was brought out in handcuffs. And now the city's most...

TURK: Hey, I'm glad you called me, Willis. Luke Cage is on the run. They got Shades in bracelets, but they're gonna be onto you before long, brother. Best believe that. Getting ghost and liquidizing your cash, that was the right move.

STRYKER: I wouldn't touch any of that. People don't test me more than once.

TURK: I overstand. What you need me for?

STRYKER: I understand you're a man of discretion and taste with numerous connections willing to pay full price for my wares. I can still collect from the shadows.

Zip comes in, wearing a pair of sunglasses.

ZIP: Bad news, Diamondback.

STRYKER: Take those off!

ZIP: I went to your crib. The files you had are gone.

Stryker walks over to Zip and grabs his throat, choking him and pushing him to the ground. He holds him there for a moment before he starts to laugh and lets him go.

STRYKER: I had you, didn't I? I couldn't resist. I like you, Zip. You've got ambition. It'll take you far as long as you stay in your place. The first of the 48 laws of power. Never outshine the master. That was the mistake Shades made. He questioned me. He doubted me. He tried to reach too far. He was on some Icarus shit. Do you know who that is?

ZIP:  Yeah, he had a verse with Kendrick.  Right?

TURK: No Icarus was the boy who flew too close to the sun with fake wings.

ZIP: Shades is no problem. He's still in custody.

STRYKER: Not for long.

ZIP: You gonna blow the joint up?

STRYKER: No, he's going to be bailed out.

ZIP: The hell for? That don't make no sense!

STRYKER: See? The questioning. That's how it starts...I'm gonna have an opening. You gonna step up?

ZIP: I'm down to do whatever you need. No problem.

STRYKER: Good boy. So are you down?

TURK: I'm down. As long as the business is business, I'm good with it. Till then, I'm out of here, man.

ZIP: Show Turk out, Zip.

TURK: Romeo would roll over in his grave, the way you hop-skipping with these cats nowadays. He was a man on these streets. You's a boy.

ZIP: What the hell are you talking about? You're down here in his pocket, same as me.

TURK: I'm doing business with him, yes. But I ain't his boy. And I definitely ain't his bitch.

Turk leaves, and Zip walks back to Stryker.

ZIP: These old-ass niggas talkin' about shit they don't even know about. So what's in the box?

STRYKER: One of the seven deadly sins, my boy which I plan to unleash on dear old Carl.

ZIP: Which one?

STRYKER: Wrath.

COLON'S GYM

ERNESTO (in Spanish): This Diamondback needs to be dealt with.

ADVISER (in Spanish): Ernesto is right, Domingo. This is the perfect time to do it. We've got the muscle. Plus, with the Cuban, Jamaican, Dominican and Haitian leaders dead, we can control the drugs, guns, all of it and walk out like kings.

DOMINGO (in English): I was there when he took them all out. Right next door. We got the drugs. We got that money. But with the guns, we can control everything. Here, the islands, further south...We'd be unstoppable. Hmm?

ERNESTO (in Spanish) So what are you saying?

DOMINGO: We take him out. We go after what's ours. Let's go find Diamondback.

THE STATIONHOUSE

Shades is standing for his mugshot. Misty watches him through the window.

OFFICER: Turn and face the camera.

RIDLEY: You're supposed to be in the hospital. Push yourself too hard too soon and you could make it worse, you know.

MISTY: I appreciate your concern.

RIDLEY: No, you don't. I need you at 100%.

MISTY: I need to prove Luke Cage is innocent.

RIDLEY: Well, the hostages have all been consistent that Luke Cage never held them at gunpoint.

MISTY: He was set up. You know it, Priscilla. Half this damn department knows it. We need to be going after Willis Stryker.

RIDLEY: Well, then why is Luke Cage running?

MISTY: He's a black man being chased by the cops oh, with special bullets. Accused of killing a cop, and you're asking why he's running? Come on.

RIDLEY: Look at how relaxed Hernan "Shades" Alvarez is. He knows he's not going anywhere anytime soon, so he's resting up. He knows he's guilty. See this perp? Look how his foot is bouncing. Nervous. No wonder his street name is Sugar. I don't even have to say a word, and here come the waterworks. He's probably innocent or less guilty than whoever he's about to give up.

MISTY: That's a detectives' wives' tale. You can't prove guilt or innocence by that.

RIDLEY: Oh, but you can...because Luke gave you his word.

MISTY: Luke...

RIDLEY: Right now, his actions are speaking louder than his words.

MISTY: Luke Cage saved my life.

RIDLEY: I don't dispute that we should be bringing in Diamondback, but to get to the truth, we need to bring them both in.

MISTY: Okay, well, let me lead the charge. Make sure Luke is brought in safely.

RIDLEY: He threw away his chance when he jumped out that damn van. Now they will shoot him on sight with the mayor's blessing.

MISTY: You know what? At least let me take a crack at Shades. He's in deep with all the players. He doesn't scare me.

RIDLEY: Detective...

MISTY: I can handle him.

RIDLEY: You just got shot. I need you to go home, get some rest. I'll interview Shades.

THE RUINED HARLEM'S PARADISE

MARIAH: My grandmother loved Harlem's Paradise. She took care of all the small details. She loved it. From the murals the glasswork, all the way down to the table linens. No fine point was overlooked. This was her legacy. My family's in tatters, and it's all because of Diamondback. Shit! Uh, I know, I know I need to get out in front of this. Release a statement about Damon Boone and how much I respected him.

ALEX: That is not what I was gonna say.

MARIAH: Well, yeah, just Please, no lectures.

ALEX: This is just a thing. Things can be rebuilt, and when you do, you rebuild it as your legacy. Not just the clubs. I want to be a part of that...Here's what I think. Controlling the narrative is everything. We can't have any loose threads. So anyone who might have overheard anything you said to Diamondback or Shades in here is a threat.

MARIAH: You're absolutely correct.

ALEX: How may I be of service?

MARIAH: I wouldn't want you to do anything untoward.

ALEX: Never.

MARIAH: Okay.

THE STREETS OF HARLEM

Luke is skulking around in daylight, in his bullet-riddled hoodie.He hides from a police car, then sees two men pull on balaclavas and enter a bodega.

LUKE: I don't have time for this.

Inside the bodega, one robber is holding a gun on the owner and Method Man while the other empties the register.

ROBBER 1: Don't move. He'll blow your head off. He's crazy like that. Don't try no shit.

The robber suddenly recognizes Method Man. He pulls up his mask

ROBBER 1: My bad, Meth. I grew up on that Wu-Tang shit. But you know how it is.

METHOD MAN: Are you serious? Are you really trying to have a conversation right now?

ROBBER 1: I'm just tryin'...I'm just sayin'...You're the man, yo.

ROBBER 2: Pull your mask down! You supposed to be watchin' the damn door, Bryce!

BRYCE: What I say about using my government name, Michael?

Luke walks in

BRYCE: Damn, homie. You look like you went through a cheese grater. Oh, snap, you Luke...

Luke smacks Bryce hard enough to knock him into a display. Michael panics and shoots at Luke several times.

MICHAEL: I ain't mean that.

LUKE: Give me your phone. The phone, fool.

MICHAEL: Yo, my bad, man. You know, I just got a little nervous and shit when you threw my mans across the...

Luke flicks Michael in the head and knocks him out.

METHOD MAN: It's you. Yeah, it's you.

LUKE: No, man, it's you. Yo, man, "P.L.O. Style" was my joint back in the day. Sweet Christmas. Yeah, man, one second.

Luke makes a phone call.

LUKE: Hey, it's me...Yeah, they'll be looking for me. I'll lay in the cut. I'll see you in a few.

Luke puts the phone away, looks to Method Man.

LUKE: You a double XL?

METHOD MAN: Way ahead of you, homie.

They trade hoodies. Luke takes a minute to destroy the robbers' gun.

LUKE: Call the cops.

BODEGA OWNER: I know a lot of people who would pay you for this kind of protection.

LUKE: They can keep their money.

METHOD MAN: Salute...You ever see anything like that before?

BODEGA OWNER: Harlem, baby. Harlem.

THE STATIONHOUSE

Misty is walking down the hall. Her phone rings.

MISTY: Hello?

CANDACE: Detective Knight?

MISTY: Candace?

CANDACE: Yeah.

MISTY: What number are you calling me from?

CANDACE: A prepaid phone I picked up from CVS. I need to see you.

MISTY: Come into the precinct.

CANDACE: No. No. You saw how quickly Mariah sent that lawyer and got me out of there.

MISTY: You didn't wanna talk to me before. What makes you trust me now?

CANDACE: Because Luke Cage does. He saved my life. And you saw right through me. You want the truth, right?

MISTY: Where are you?

CANDACE: Look, if you can't help...

MISTY: Candace.

CANDACE: Tell me a place, and I will be there.

INTERROGATION ROOM

RIDLEY: You should be at Rikers right now, but I held you because I think you have something to say.

SHADES: Lawyer.

RIDLEY: I know your record, Mr. Alvarez. Came up in Harlem, rolled around with Cottonmouth in the late '90s, spent some time at Spofford, Sing Sing, then you made it to the big time, went to Seagate.

SHADES: Lawyer.

RIDLEY: Cornell Stokes is dead, but you're still alive. And I've never seen an arraignment happen so quickly. Two million dollar bail and someone paid it in cash. Who's your new sponsor? Is it Willis Stryker?

SHADES: Law...yer.

RIDLEY: You were part of a hostage situation, Hernan. Even if your lawyer does get you out you won't be walking away from that. That's multiple kidnapping and weapons charges. How does 25 years to life sound to you? Minimum.

SHADES: Are you serious?

RIDLEY: Yep.

SHADES: Okay. Okay. I I was in the club. I saw what happened. I know who did it.

RIDLEY: Okay. We can protect you, but I need a name to verify. Who was it? Was it Stryker?

SHADES: He goes by...lawyer. You need me to spell it?

Shades laughs Ridley out the door.

THE WATERSIDE

CANDACE: You call this safe?

MISTY: We're hiding in plain sight. I've got you...For now. Lie to me again, Candace, I walk away from here, and you are on your own.

CANDACE: It's not bullshit.

MISTY: We'll see. How did you even get out of Harlem's Paradise without being stopped?

CANDACE: They were so busy trying to arrest Luke, I just walked away.

MISTY: So what is it? What do you need to tell me that's so important?

CANDACE: I was at the club the night Cottonmouth died.

MISTY: I already know that.

CANDACE: I mean right after.

Misty deliberately takes out her phone and holds it up so Candace can see her touch the "record" button.

CANDACE: Mariah killed him.

Misty pictures herself in Harlem's Paradise as Shades and Mariah cover up the crime.

SHADES (flashback):The trash bag is for the clothes you're wearing now. Every stitch goes in. Jewelry, too. Someone from Spurlock's will incinerate them....The secret to any good lie is it has to run parallel to the truth....

MISTY: How do you know this?

CANDACE:  I heard them talking about it.

SHADES (flashback): ...do what I say...

CANDACE: The guy who always wears sunglasses, he was there. It was his idea to say Luke Cage killed Cottonmouth. I was so scared. I snuck out of there, back to the lockers.
And, um, I was trying to calm myself down. When I went upstairs, the guy with the glasses offered me $50,000 to tell a story. So I told one.

MISTY: Why are you coming clean now?

CANDACE: 'Cause I can't live with this. Especially after Luke saving my life. If you can guarantee my safety, I will testify about everything I just told you.

Misty stops recording and puts her phone away.

Mariah scares me more than Cottonmouth. I asked her if she thought Luke did it, mostly to see if I could trust her. To see if she would tell me the truth. She looked me right in my eye and said "You never know what anyone is capable of." It was the way she said it. She...she would kill me if she knew I was speaking to you, I truly believe that. Thank you for helping me.

MISTY: I'm gonna nail Mariah Dillard's ass to the wall. Who else knows that you're here?

CANDACE: Just my friend Leslie.

MISTY: Don't call anyone else, not even Leslie. As a matter of fact, give me your phone. Come on.

CANDACE: Okay.

Misty hands her a new burner.

MISTY: Now, I picked this up on the way, just in case. It's already got my number programed in there, so if I call or text, you know it's me.

CANDACE: Is your arm okay?

MISTY:  My trigger finger is just fine.
Come on, let's go.

CANDACE: Where?

MISTY: Soledad's. Her daughter Claire is the one who treated your ankle at Harlem's Paradise. She'll be there, too. I'm gonna take you there myself.

Nearby, Alex watches them from a car.

SWAY'S STUDIO

METHOD MAN: No lie. Bullets was flying everywhere and shit.

HEATHER B:You trying to tell me that those are bullet holes? Man, Meth, I love you, but get out of here. I don't believe that.

METHOD MAN: HB, I thought the same thing until shorty pulled the biscuit and let two off on Cage and they bounced off. Bullets ricochetin' and shit. Look, I'm telling y'all the truth. I see y'all over there, y'all don't believe it.
Trust me, it's the truth. And after he smacked fire out these dudes, he left the hoodie, told me and Gomez to call the police...You know I ain't calling no po-po...Then he bounced.

SWAY: Say word.

METHOD MAN: Word, Sway. I'm telling you. He even balled the dude's gun up like some old homework.

HEATHER B: But my thing is, though, if he innocent, so what he running for?

METHOD MAN: Bulletproof always gonna come second to being black. HB, you should know that. You from Jers. Jers!

SWAY: Wow! Sound like he stunted on you right there.

HEATHER B: He did stunt. It was a stunt. It was a stunt. Why you gotta stunt on me?

METHOD MAN: No, I mean, seriously. Seriously, though, what I'm just saying, like, if that was me, and I was on the run...Why even get involved? But he did. And those dudes was nervous, so anything could've happened. As far as I'm concerned, Luke Cage saved my life, man.

SWAY: That's what's up, man. You know what, that don't sound like no cop killer to me.

METHOD MAN: For real, for real. You know, there's somethin' powerful about seeing a black man that's bulletproof and unafraid. Come on, y'all. You know? Streets got mad love for Cage. I got mad love for Cage, man, and and he one of ours.

SWAY: But you know what? We got mad love for you, too.

HEATHER B: No doubt.

SWAY: You one of ours, man. You know, the show's almost over, man. You gonna spit for us?

METHOD MAN: Of course.

SWAY: Oh, man! He 'bout to spit! Citizens, you are in for a treat. One of the best to pick up the mic, the one and only Method Man!

METHOD MAN: Hey, yo, Sway. You all ready? I'mma dedicate this one to the hardest individual on the street right now. Luke Cage, you already know. "Bulletproof Love" your way, brother.

During this song we see a montage of cops trying to track down Luke Cage, stopping black men with bullet-riddled hoodies. However, the whole of Harlem has started to wear them. Gomez the bodega owner is selling them to a huge crowd.

Let's get it.
Listen.
Man, it is what it is
Can't understand a man if you ain't lived what he lived
Roaches in the crib, ain't got no food up in the fridge
Plus the crime running rampant and it's screwing up the kids
Sway, admit, what kind of paradise is this?
I just want my 40 acres and some carats on the wrist
But these snakes is trying to gather in the pit
When you get a cottonmouth, plucking ashes off the clip
Off the rip, now a challenger exists
And he bulletproof, shoot, what kind of caliber is this?
Got thugs in the store with the barrel on your lips
Saying, "empty out the drawer" before he pound you with the grip
Lord, who to call when no one obeys the law
And there ain't no Iron Man that can come and save us all?
Power to the people and Luke Cage the cause
And the cops got it wrong, we don't think Cage involved
Look, dog, a hero, never had one
Already took Malcolm and Martin, this is the last one
I beg your pardon, somebody pulling a fast one
Now we got a hero for hire and he a black one
And bullet-hole hoodies is the fashion
We in Harlem's Paradise, tell the Captain
That I'm about to trade the mic for a Magnum
Give up my life for Trayvon to have one


Yeah, 'cause this is bulletproof love
And you already know what a bulletproof does
So you can take it from a bulletproof thug
The hood got his back, dog, bulletproof love
The blood thicker than mud
And who am I to judge if you get a gun in the club?
'Cause you already know what a bulletproof does
When the hood got your back, dog, bulletproof love


Yeah, shoutout to Pop. RIP, my brother. The streets is crazy nowadays. People say we don't need another hero, but now we got one whether you like it or not. Luke Cage, please believe it, sir. The streets got your back. You already bulletproof love, baby
The streets is crazy right now, you know what I'm sayin'? People say we don't need another hero, but now we got one. Whether you like it or not, Luke Cage, please believe it, sir, the streets got your back. You're already bulletproof love, baby!

SWAY: Yeah! That was dope. You got it right here on Sway's Universe. The homie, Method Man, HB, and the bulletproof thug, Luke Cage.
Law enforcement is in a frenzy looking for Luke Cage.

THE BARBERSHOP

THEMBI WALLACE NEWSCAST: There have been numerous false sightings, with some people wearing hoodies with holes as a sign of solidarity with an outlaw some people still perceive to be a hero.

SWAY: Sway in the Morning. What's on your mind, citizen?

CALLER: Yo, I remember when Larry Davis was on the run back in the day. Cops came at him 'cause they were just as corrupt, dangerous and jacked up as he was. I don't think we're getting the full story on Luke Cage yet, for real.

Fish is listening to Sway and watching Thembi on the news at the Barbershop.

SWAY: I wouldn't put it past the government, man. Um, you know, we're gonna be searching for the answers for you, and once we get the facts, we're gonna put it right here on Sway's Universe, all right? Thanks for your call, citizen. We got another person on the line...

Fish changes the station to jazz. Plainclothes officers rush in to raid the shop.

OFFICERS: Now! Come on! All right.

FISH: Oh, come on, man. You know he's not here.

Smith walks over to Fish's chessboard.

SMITH: I understand playing against the computer, but, um, how do you beat yourself?

FISH: Chess is a game of anticipation. If you know every single possible move, you can anticipate your adversary's next move before he does.

SMITH: Oh. That's deep. If we find out you've been hiding him, there'll be hell to pay.

FISH: Yeah, well, just don't break the hinges on that door on your way out. I just got it fixed.

The cops drive away. Luke watches them go and comes into the shop.

FISH: That was a close shave.

LUKE: Bad pun.

FISH: What the hell did you even come back for, man?

LUKE: I had to. For Harlem. Take care of Diamondback before he made it bad for everybody.

FISH: Well, forget Harlem. Forget your brother! You're on the road in a brand new car and a woman that fine? And you're bulletproof. You'd have never seen my black ass again. I'd rob the occasional bank and never look back. You got every cop in the city looking for you, brother. Negroes writing Luke Cage ballads and shit. So what's the plan?

LUKE: To box in all the players.

FISH: Well, Shades is in jail. Mariah's out, but she ain't exactly on your side. Now you could tail both of 'em, but no telling how long that'll take for them to lead you to your prey. What about Misty?

LUKE:  No, she's got her hands full already. She's trying to clear my name inside the precinct and bring me in at the same time. We gotta be careful with her.

FISH: That leaves you one other option. Someone else to find Diamondback. Here. Turk.

Fish gets up and goes to the wall phone.

LUKE: Turk may be a pawn, but he's not dumb. If he thinks he's being set up, he'll disappear.

FISH: You let me worry about that. Hey, Turk, it's Bobby. Listen, I might be able to get my hands on about 30 pairs of Jordans. They're the vintage Air Jordan 5s.
Let's just say they fell off the back of a truck...Okay, when?

INTERROGATION ROOM

Ridley walks in with an unfamiliar woman.

SHADES: Who's this?

RIDLEY: First name "Law," last name "Yer." Must be pretty damn connected to get a lawyer and not even know who she is.

SHADES: Membership has its privileges.

In the hall, Misty bumps into Shades on his way out.

MISTY: He sprung you? You think this is funny, don't you? You got this all figured out, huh?

SHADES: No. Actually, I don't.

UNDER A BRIDGE

Zip, Shades, and some minions get out of a car.

SHADES: When did Diamondback bring in new hires?

ZIP: Well, after the club, he had to change things up. Recruit some new faces.

They all walk into an abandoned factory.

ZIP: I bet while you were inside, cops tried to do some recruiting of their own.

SHADES: Don't ever question my loyalty.

They all step into a old service elevator.

SHADES: The man upstairs?

ZIP:  You are just full of questions. Matter of fact...

Zip wraps a cord around Shades' neck to strangle him. The other minions wait impassively. Shades struggles until he grabs a minion's gun and starts shooting, taking out the minions before even breaking free from Zip. He turns on Zip last, holding the gun on him.

SHADES: Let's go to the penthouse.

THE ROOF

ZIP: I was just following orders!

SHADES: You're a goddamn puppet. Who gave you the order? Who?

ZIP: Diamondback! You stopped playing your position. Asked too many questions. Diamondback said you needed to be dealt with.

SHADES: Romeo would be ashamed of you. You're such a disappointment.

ZIP: You're the second person who told me that today. I'm my own man, Shades.

SHADES: Tell him yourself.

Shades shoots Zip in the head. He finds the sunglasses in Zip's pocket.

SHADES: Nice...Sorry, Romeo He had to go.

MARIAH'S BROWNSTONE

MARIAH: It's a good thing her friend Leslie knew where she was. I'm glad you found the park. So where is she now?

ALEX: She left with Detective Knight. Traffic got thick and I lost them. I'm sorry. I'm not used to doing anything like this.

MARIAH: We'll find her again. Just knowing that she can't be trusted is helpful. You did a good job, Alex. Hey, you're my rock! Later.

Mariah's phone rings. She puts in an earbud before she answers to speak on her headset.

MARIAH: What do you want?

STRYKER (over the phone): That's no way to speak to a business partner.

MARIAH: After what you did to my club, do you really think I'm gonna shuck and jive with you?

STRYKER (over the phone): You might wanna check your attitude. If you're not of any use to me, then you're not useful to anyone. Shades would tell you, if he was still alive.

MARIAH: What the hell are you talking about?

STRYKER (over the phone): I had to let him go.
So now, I'm giving you the chance to tell me where you stand. I've taken Shades and Damon Boone off the table so you can grow. I'd hate for us to part, too.

MARIAH: I wasn't particularly fond of Shades and the death of Damon Boone, although unnecessary, was appreciated. But you need to know this. I'm out of the political game. I'm focusing on Harlem's Paradise. Using it for a a power base for community relations.

Instead of answering over the phone, Styker comes into the room.

STRYKER: That's a smart move. But you've made some dumb ones also. You should never talk about murder on an open line.

He drops a duffel bag in front of her.

STRYKER: Open it. Seed money for your New Harlem Renaissance project and refurbishing the club. My apologies.

MARIAH: It's a very generous donation but nothing in this world is free.

STRYKER: You're right. My only condition is loyalty. Stick with me and Harlem will be remade in your own image. We'll be doing this for years to come.

MARIAH: Harlem is already in my image. You staying?

STRYKER: Once I'm finished with Carl, I'll evaporate. But don't worry. You'll still feel the occasional cool breeze. Sweet dreams, Mariah.

THE STREETS OF HARLEM

Turk is walking down the street. Luke grabs him and pulls him into an alley.

LUKE: You ratted out Chico. You got Pop killed.

TURK: Man, the writing was on the wall. Somebody would have seen him. Might as well be me. How was I supposed to know Tone was gonna shoot up the shop? Whole damn world know Pop's was Switzerland. Forever.

LUKE: I should crush you.

TURK: You won't, though. You need me.

LUKE: Where's Diamondback?

TURK: I don't know.

Luke picks Turk up and holds him high in the air, then throws him into a dumpster and starts to crush it around Turk's body.

LUKE: You still stalling?

TURK: All right! All right! He's at a warehouse by the Harlem River. Near 145th, all right? I gave you what you wanted! Now let me out!

LUKE: Sit tight, Mr. Barrett. Trash pickup is tomorrow. You can breathe just fine. There's food in there, too.

TURK: You can't leave me in here! There's baby diapers in here, man! Hey! Come on!

DIAMONDBACK'S WAREHOUSE

Domingo and his minions are walking through the abandoned warehouse.

DOMINGO: Looks like you downgraded. I liked the club better.

STRYKER: I'm a man who needs his space.

DOMINGO: Space is a good thing. Especially when you come to kill a man.

STRYKER: Whoa, whoa.

Domingo and his guys pull their guns on the seemingly lone Stryker. Stryker's men emerge from the shadows, equally armed.

DOMINGO: Someone did your boy Zip and his two homies. That's not Cage's style so I'm guessing Shades didn't appreciate you bailing him out.

STRYKER: You know when a rattlesnake is at its most dangerous, Domingo? When it's cornered.

Stryker pulls out his guns and starts shooting. There is a long shootout.

DOMINGO: I'm gonna rip your head off!

Eventually Stryker escapes the melee and goes into another room. He opens a crate and a red glow illuminates his face.

STRYKER: "And behold a pale horse and he that sat upon him, his name was Death."

MARIAH'S BROWNSTONE

Mariah is counting Stryker's cash and drinking. She gets up and opens a gold box in her living room that has the pearl-handled gun that Cottonmouth used to kill Uncle Pete. Shades comes into the room.

SHADES: You really need a security system. You waiting for me?

MARIAH: No.

SHADES: I bet he told you I was dead. Diamondback got to you, didn't he?

MARIAH: No, he didn't.

SHADES: What are you doing with a gun? It's not you.

MARIAH: Shut up.

SHADES: I have something for you. Figured you'd want this.

He holds out the bottle she used to hit Cottonmouth over the head when she killed him.

SHADES: Your prints, Cornell's blood.

MARIAH: Then you'll have nothing to blackmail me with.

SHADES: I don't need it. We're in this together now.

MARIAH: You and I have come a long way. You know, sometimes you have to reach across the aisle to get things done.

SHADES: You're talking about Luke Cage? It's incredible how much you and I think alike. We're at war. And right now, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

MARIAH: Maybe. But it might not take. You did beat his ass and give him his powers. And Cornell's flunky killed Pop. You think he really is gonna jump? Just jump on our bandwagon?

SHADES: Absolutely. 'Cause we have something that he wants more than anything.

He pulls an official looking manila envelope out of his bag.

His old life. A chance to clear his name. Right here.

MARIAH: If we send Luke after Diamondback and they kill each other all of our problems are swept away. No matter who wins.

SHADES: Even better.

DIAMONDBACK'S WAREHOUSE

Luke breaks the metal door down and sees the results of the firefight. The warehouse is filled with dead bodies. He finds Domingo Colon, who isn't quite dead yet.

DOMINGO: I should've known you'd turn up.

LUKE: What the hell happened here?

DOMINGO: Diamondback.

Luke hears beeping. He follows it to that side room and finds Stryker's crate. It has a bomb inside with a countdown at 45 seconds.

LUKE: Sweet sister.

Cut to Luke running out of the warehouse carrying Domingo.

LUKE: Slow. Take it easy. What did he use? How did Diamondback do that?

DOMINGO: Something I've never seen before. Even you can't stop him.

Domingo dies.

THE STATIONHOUSE

The shot of Domingo's death becomes a crime scene photo on Misty's wall.

MISTY: These just came in.

BAILEY: Elephant punches all over again.

MISTY: Mmm-hmm.

BAILEY:That's gotta be Cage, right?

Misty's cell phone rings.

MISTY: Hello?

LUKE (over the phone): Hey, it's me. You guys find Domingo?

MISTY: Yeah.

LUKE: Meet me.

MISTY: Where?

She quickly gathers her things and leaves.

THE STREETS OF HARLEM

Misty stops in front of the grated window of an abandoned building. Luke is inside, talking to her through the window.

MISTY: Should I thank you for this?

LUKE: All credit goes to Diamondback.

MISTY: I don't suppose we'll find his body. We found Zip's, though, and two other thugs in an old building. Shot up. Right after they picked up your other boy.

LUKE: Shades. Don't you ever get tired of people getting out?

MISTY: Yes. Look, it's not safe for you to be here. If you don't find Diamondback...

LUKE: Then he wins, and my life is forever a living hell.

MISTY: Is there anything I can do?

LUKE: See what else Turk knows. He's in a Dumpster in an alley on 123rd. Near Mount Olivet and the shop.

MISTY: A dumpster?

OUTSIDE MOUNT OLIVET CHURCH

Mariah and Shades are sitting in a car.

MARIAH: Even if we handle Diamondback he's not gonna forgive us for framing him for Cornell's death.

SHADES: We could hurdle that easy. The only people who know what really happened in the club are you and me.

MARIAH: I'll regret that night for the rest of my life.

SHADES: You did what you had to do. You shouldn't regret that.

MARIAH: What were you even doing at the club that night?

SHADES: I was going there to kill him. You beat me to it.

MARIAH: Cornell never needed my political money. And he was never going to pay it back. He just wanted me in all the way.

SHADES: So what are you saying?

MARIAH: He saw things in me that I avoided my whole life. Now I am becoming that person he always saw and I always denied.

SHADES: You ready?

MARIAH: I stay ready, baby.

They climb out of the car and walk into

THE BARBERSHOP

FISH: I should've kept my coat on. Hell just froze over.

MARIAH: Where's Luke Cage?

LUKE: I'm right here.

SHADES:We have a problem.

LUKE: So do I. I can't decide which one of you I'm gonna knock out first. Where's Diamondback?

SHADES: I don't know. The parley between the three of us is more important.

LUKE: You have the nerve to use that term? Right here? Where Pop died? Cough up Diamondback's location, or I'll stomp you like we were back at Seagate.

FISH: Luke, be cool, brother.

MARIAH: Whoa, whoa. No one needs to stomp anyone. Pops made this place Switzerland for a reason. Cage, we have a mutual enemy, and the only way to bring him down is for us all to come together.

LUKE: There's no way I'm helping you.

MARIAH: We came to offer you a truce. In exchange for helping you find Diamondback, you drop your beef with us.

LUKE: You both framed me for murder. There's nothing you can offer me that's going to make me let that go.

SHADES: How about your freedom? Right here is everything you need to prove that Diamondback framed Carl Lucas.

LUKE: Even if Carl Lucas is exonerated Luke Cage is now wanted for the murder of Cottonmouth.

MARIAH: I'll tell them the truth. Diamondback killed Cornell and Damon Boone. You'll go free.

Misty emerges from the back room.

SHADES:What the hell is this?

MISTY: Mariah Dillard, you're under arrest for the murder of Cornell Stokes.

LUKE: I thought you said you were going after Turk?

MISTY: I've been tracking you since you called. I wasn't going to let you just ghost me again.

LUKE: Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shades, back off! Misty, stand down. We're working this out.

MISTY: Oh, so you workin' with them now?

LUKE: He knows where Diamondback is.

SHADES: I didn't say that.

MISTY: Well, whatever you know, Hernan, you should share it with the whole class.

SHADES: I ain't telling you shit.

Something drops to the ground right outside the shop.

LUKE: Grenade!

Everyone drops to the ground (with Luke between them and the door) to cover their heads. The grenade goes off, blowing out all the windows of the shop. In the chaos Misty drops her phone and Shades picks it up. Stryker comes in wearing a green suit and helmet.

FISH: What the hell? What type of Jean Paul Gaultier shit is this? What are you, a pimp stormtrooper?

STRYKER: No, I'm the angel of death.

SHADES (aside to Mariah): You told him to meet us here?

MARIAH: No.

STRYKER: Damn! Look at Hernan the cockroach. Your mama should have named you Pedro.

Shades lifts his gun and fires at Stryker. The bullets ricochet off of his suit.

MARIAH: Shades!

FISH: God damn it! I just fixed this place up all perfect and shit! Y'all can't take this outside?

LUKE & STRYKER: No.

FISH: All right, just just sayin'.

LUKE (to Misty): Don't let Mariah get away.

MISTY: I won't. Kick his ass, Luke.

STRYKER: You know I'm gonna kill 'em all later, right?

LUKE: You have to get past me first.

STRYKER: Oh, I don't go past. I go through.

They both yell and charge each other before the screen goes black.




Yeah... one-two, one-two, it's Big M-E-F
The phenom from Vietnam, fresh out of rehab, yo
On my way the weedspot, haha, what's good?
Fuck that, what's hood? Staten Island Advance
Big up to my man Magic down in MIA, what up cuzo?


Knock-knock, who is it, ah shitted
Hot peas and butter, come and get it
Somebody done fucked up, now
Meth spit it, I comes with it
Quick to tell these critics, eat a did-ick
Somebody done fucked up, now
Y'all done did it, done stepped in it
Now run and tell them niggas who the realest
Somebody done fucked up, now
Can you dig it, you'll never stop the kid up in the fitted
Live with it, somebody done fucked up


Look, I'm cutting corners on these clowns, marijuana and pounds
Found with Staten Island niggas that run up on you with rounds
Take a drag, pass it around, guess who back in your town
And the crowd vict', with Officer Brown patting him down
Shit's thick, thick as harmony grits, cuz with some thugs
Ain't no, harmony bitch, them niggas probably snitch
Y'all be the judge, look what happened to Cocheese
What happens when your co-d's is talking to police, you dig?
Half a cig, let me fuck with ya wig, although you loving the style
They're ain't a pedophile could fuck with the kid
Now that I'm back up on my, feet, take it back to the streets
In the GM with your BM, in the passenger seat
Riding hood, by my hood, ain't no hike in the wood
Life is good, it's so good, live it twice if I could
Man, it's me, once again it's that Wu-Tang
Crushing the shit that you bring, you know how we do things




Yo, pulling my shoes up, scuffing my Timbs, back to when?
Puffing again, who stunting, cops fucking with them
Feeling the blow, goosebumping the skin, and on the scale
Of nothing to ten, a ten, man, it's nothing to him
See you can tell by how I'm clutching my pen, like Mae Weather touching her chin
She stunting, going up in her friend
Tell the label give me something to spin, and every light got a price
You want a slice, but we ain't cutting you in
Man, these fiends know my past work, held a monkey until they back hurt
Money talking, wonder what that's worth
And MCF, mean Cash First shit, picture the kid
On the beach in Hawaii, minus the grass skirt
Blast first, ask questions last
Black herse, nigga, stretch yo ass, y'all niggas know what this is
It's New Yitty, this ain't just a fad
It's M-E-F, and I ain't Biggie, but I'm just as Bad, Boy




Yeah, Big M-E-F, Staten Island Advance, motherfuckers
Word up, don't ever count me out, just count me the fuck in
I'll be back for more...

Sinatra, the pop the Jackson 5 recordings
Uptown Saturday, "Cotton Came to Harlem"
Ringmaster circus was, Bailey and Barnum
Crack a Coca-Cola, summer heat was my boredom

Mayweather fight night homie, Im still you best bet
Im like the homie 2 chains onme
Protect your neck, neck
Opposites attract, I got you standing opposite, the mack
Cops pursuing, now I am swallowing the crack
This aint your role model on the track, simple fact
This is call of duty, watch my gun nozzle through the map map

Thats the reason why my father kept the rifle plus a bible on his lap
Hallelujah, I am playing my position, karma sutra
And anybody play me out position ima shoot ya

 Uhh
 Deadly melody part two
 That's my word!
It ain't safe no more... bitch!


Yo, yo
Brain gets punctured and drained through the nasal
Hour of assassination be upon you
Movin with the tiger strike, bound, gagged and shot
Red the head in, dapple light centered
East remains hot with police
But I keep a lease for my, four-fifth automatic
Extended clip rewind, bust mine
Anytime you reveal your snakeish ways and actions
Observe the magnetic attraction


And it's time for some grid...


...iron rap, action-packed grudge match
Tough act to follow, hard copy novel
Throw you off the Verrazano
We swimmin with these sharks, yo I rate bodyguard
Stamp my initial in your birthmark
P.L.O., bust like a calico, tally ho
Black expo, Tecs in afros, we back yo
It's Dolemite, crash your windpipe, with the mic device
Fatal strike, daily mic fights, shoot out the street lights


Sight beyond sight, late night, city light
Tight like a virgin, mergin with my A-Alikes
Splurgin, dirty to the grain, no detergent
Filthy, innocent until I'm proven guilty
Submergin, deeper in the lecture I'm servin
Truth or consequences, life or death sentence
I'm hurtin, your person, I'm certain, it's curtains

Chorus: Method Man

It ain't nuttin like hip-hop music
You like it cause you choose it
Most DJ's won't refuse it
A lot of sucker MC's misuse it
Don't think that Wu can't lose it
Too much to gain to abuse it
The name of the game is rapture
This one is complete, it captures bass


Yo, I bring chaos to blocks like the riots in Watts
Rapid fire shots ripple through Kevlar, 9 Glocks
Technique of rhyme pop machine gun ammo
Sporadic flow buckled a foe, intro to outro
Calico, throw verse, but slide my dough first
I make thousands in the club with no shirts, go bezerk
From the Shao' borough, whylin out on the furlow
Commando, styles thorough, solo inferno
It burns slow, thermonuclear degrees
Heads are underseas down to the youngest seeds
Wannabes clone, they light like summer breeze
Hundred G's for the Garden, them fans stampede
For the top cats, hit the mic like the iron-palm blast
Equipped to perform the task
S-I-N-Y, and what, head or gut
The head rush, will cause your cerebellum to bust


We be the world's most fabulous
Hazardous, to fuck with these ravenous
Killers get you stuck to the wall like wooden cabinets
Extravagant, je-wel drop a helicopter high
Up into the sky, lines philosiphize, I got stocks to buy
Watch my pockets rise, to the bottom bust confide in God
In Sin I trust, the villianous, criminal minded killers rust
I intend to build and fortify in men
Mastermind rhymin, navigate the globe then retire quick


Aiyyo fluid rap bend through it black, buluga black Ac'
Tackle that, ghetto tabernackles throw it in your lap
Slang A-K, national, geographical
Mathematical, slide up in your work casual
Nike Air Dog, who wear it all, plus down to brawl
All a thousand with a bloody hair, flammable
Rap mayors, who clap Himalayas pinky fingers
Ever glacer, lacer, hand laser touches grail bomb blazers
Sly-workin, network bezerk, mad hurtin
Killer whales, fucking up sales, crash Bloomingdales
Masqevendo, John Lennon tenor break, mad descendo
Fuck y'all niggas carve my ice through your Benz window

*door creaking open*
*gunshots followed by a car alarm*

Chorus


Uhh.. Spazz-Ola.. (Spazz-Ola)
S-I-N-Y 10304
Lock your doors
Crack your jaws
Drop your drawers
It's all day everyday with this rap souflee




Stay dip, cute bitch out in Delaware, moving our bricks
So hard, stupid big stones from Miss Stella ear
She just turn 35, we in the spot on Martin Luther King Drive
Whole team getting high, on phones
We learned different codes of pig Latin
So the jakes dont follow our trail with sick patterns
And the crib is jig, Jennifer convertible love seat
Thats worth forty Gs from Madrid
In Spain, sipping cherry Cosmos and things
Stella, finish the glass, showing niggas her rings
I said bitch, I aint impressed with that
Why the fuck is every briefcase short by at least ten stacks
We had a mil' in each bag, theres eighty grand missing
You pop up with a new Jag', with a bad system
I done sent your ass to Hawaii and Waikiki
When your man needed bail, youll come see me
Rob me? Thats how we do? You pretty slick muthafucka
You must think Im a sucker
Matter fact, you gon' suck this dick, how bout that for a change
Let me see whats really on your brain
She said Starkey, you violating me, stop it'
I saved up for this shit, you playing me like a hostage
Out of all people, I wheeled you around, when you got shot
Be the closest one too you, and may I rot
In hell, yo Starks, chill, I dont think she that stupid
Since '90, '95, she came through, kid
Two million in six weeks, cover six space
Just to think of those towns alone, we brought a big steak


But it still dont change the job
Aiyo, Tone, who this silly bitch trynna rob
Niggas been getting money, since pushing a Saeb
In the spot writing rhymes, never heard of a blog
Is it that coincidental? That the same rental
Be out in Virginia and DC, before she come see me
Im ready, put this hammer in her face in 3D
I know thats your home girl, but fuck it, on GP
And I dont like her brother, either, he probably put her up to it
Give me the word and I go empty his fluid
Shady? I been bagging up since 1980
Me and Ghost been tight, since Fred met Grady, lady
So what you telling me? My account is off?
Oh you must really motherfucking think we that damn soft


Hold on, yo, Sheek, what you gon' do? Cut her whole hand off?
Put a pillow over her face, and let the four bang off?
Or we can get the gat taping so the ho cant talk
Before we get the whole story cut this whole thing short
I dont think thats wise at all, whatever honey do with her money, dog
Thats not my problem, why is it yours?
Wu-Block, you riding for mine, Im riding for yours
Thats the motto if you talking bout homicide, my lord
Its survival, homey, you aint never lied, my lord
But the Pretty Toney baby aint never lied before
Thats a hundred lucci, word to Bully, I smoke too many loosies
I know her history, if something fishy, must be the coochie
It aint no mystery, your finger itchy, if she a groupie
Once you go up, once you go down, lets keep it Gucci
You take her head, I take all the jewelry from all these moolies
Get all your goonies, and we can meet up for Call of Duty
Aint nothing funny like Paul Mooney, this fatal beauty
Got some explaining to do, hold up, I thought you knew me
Better than that, we know the cheddar was tapped
You getting bread in the trap, why get in bed with them rats
My son is missing some racks, and Louch is fitting to snap
She need to come up with answers, instead of fixing her mack
Makeup, just give the facts, straight up, and just the facts
If you did it, we gon' bury you with it, and thats that




This goes out
To all the big head niggas
And all them big head bitches
You know my steez-o

Yo, yo, yo, yo
Deadly melodic, robotic steez-o blur your optic
So you can't see the topic, condition combo
Blaze bring the heat to your Mourning like Alonzo
Head honcho like Eastwood, gun in my pancho
Another bad desperado, trapped inbetween
The hills and the El Dorados, but you can't do that
Welcome to the Wheel of Fortune where Pat don't Sajak
Bring it to these cats often, the biggest payback
Is when I condemn men, to purgatory
Stick a pen, do em in, eight million stories
In the naked Mr. Method, Blade Runner
Blood stain on my track record, top gunner


You know it's sick now, just a little bit, aw shit
Can't quit now, hard as a brick, what's this
Make em get down, head where I fit, more grip
Hold this shit down, she don't know you better school her
("Step in the Arena" sample scratched)
Step by Step, inch by inch, piece by piece, bit by bit
Step by Step, inch by inch, piece by piece, bit by bit


Check my Extinction Agenda, mind bender
No retreat no surrender, head trauma
Death before dishonor, sword and golden armor
Undetected stealth bomber, blow the session
With Immaculate Conception, hit yo' section
With my Def Squad connection, the Green-Eyed Bandit
E Double up dammit, Iron Lung
Flow taste like a knuckle sandwich, now you know
It's time that I take advantage, take command yo
Cops caught me red-handed
Blood On the Dance Floor
Or was it Michael Jackson
Fuck it, time for some action
Check my Re-Runs an see What's Happening


You know it's sick now, just a little bit, aw shit
Can't quit now, hard as a brick, what's this
Make em get down, head where I fit, more grip
Hold this shit down, she don't know you better school her

Step by Step, inch by inch, piece by piece, bit by bit
Step by Step, inch by inch, piece by piece, bit by bit
[You know it's sick now, just a little bit, aw shit
Can't quit now, hard as a brick, what's this
Make em get down, head where I fit, more grip
Hold this shit down, she don't know you better school her


Before she get her back blown
Jealous men don't understand and get clapped on, now I'm reloadin
Automate and keep it goin, right and exact
Runnin track like I'm Jesse Owens, catch em wit my rap slogan
Jack Frost, leave em frozen
Bust flows and never lay text/latex without my Trojan
Hand writtin ass whippin, I keep spittin
At any head-on collision, throw dart wit precision
And split decision, tell your old folk
And your children what I'm dealin
Good times, and hood rhymes from the villain
Till I see you at the ooh-building motherfuckers


You know it's sick now, just a little bit, aw shit
Can't quit now, hard as a brick, what's this

This one, is dedicated to my big head niggas
And all them big head bitches
All them big head bitches




Ooh-wee... mmmmmmmm, yeah...


See I was raised out on these mean streets
I'm from the projects, right, where poverty and hell meet
I'm searching everyday to find a better way, I've got a
Hustle still to get my pay before I hit bottom
Now some might say that I'm already there
But who are they to judge or question what I do, son
So I don't care
Tired of eating cheese sandwiches with no meat
Tired of watching all the players from the same seat
So it's a life of crime, some might sing or rhyme
To escape the ghetto before the flatline
Choices to make, what am I gonna do?
Got to use my talents, they gonna pull me through


Now with success, I become a target
They wanna set me up
I guess more money equals more problems
They wanna get me, wanna hit me, strip me of my riches
They wanna cut me up in pieces, leave me deep in ditches


And I can't take it.... but I'm gonna make it...
Yeah... oh... I'm gonna make it... yeah... ohhhhhh
Fight to stay alive


I was raised out on these mean streets
You know where poverty and hell meet
Brothers get jail and life's for sale, cheap
Since momma held me, in her arms, to tell me
That it's a cold world, I done held heat
And held myself down, lot of bodies and shells found
And niggas into taking everything, that ain't nailed down
We fell down, ain't hard to tell now
I ain't trying to see the cell now
Or see momma put her house up for bail now
So I'mma give all I got, to try and get that gwop
Nigga I'm hot with this hustle, go 'head and get the cops
I use my talent to get more figures
Unlike these little corner store niggas
Go change your drawers, niggas


Now with success and I've become a target
They wanna set me up, take me hostage
Or take me down some notches
They wanna hit me, wanna stick me, get me for my riches
They wanna diss me, want a clip me, leave me stiff in ditches

[Hook: Gerald Alston (Method Man)
And I can't take it, no, no, but I'm gonna make it...
(This ain't no game, my life ain't nothing to play with)
Yeah... I'm gonna make it... oooh...
(Face it, money is power and I'mma make it)
I'm gonna make it... oooh...


Yeah, I'm gon' survive, yo, yo, a-yo
N.Y. City, gritty blocks, little love, plenty cops
Few rise, many drop, True Lies, semis cocked
Fishscale, already rocked, heavy shots, that we drop
New guys on every block, blue eyes and red dots
Pregnant mothers, broke fathers, more money, more problems
So hungry, won't starve 'em, work hard and so pardon
I got mouths to feed, I got pounds of weed
I need some more, another store, another house, indeed
An X amount of G, the reason pounds'll squeeze
And strip you naked, basic, trying to make it out the P's
Don't ever doubt a G, and have me spazz like
'Face with the K, and my nose all powdery
It ain't about the streets, it's 'bout the beast within
That won't give in to 'lice, down to bleed, G


Now with success and I've become a target
They wanna set me up, take me hostage
Or take me down some notches
They wanna hit me, wanna stick me, get me for my riches
They wanna diss me, wanna clip me leave me stiff in ditches

[Hook: Gerald Alston (RZA)
And I can't take it (yeah), no, no, but I'm gonna make it...
(Yeah, yea, turn the beat up a little right here)
Yeah... I'm gonna make it... oooh...
(Yo, yo, yo, yeah, yo, just, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)


A-yo, RZA, Meth, GZA, Deck
Ghost and Chef be cashing checks
Killa, Cap be snapping necks
Street and 'Zilla flash the tech
Sacrifice a savage life
If he trying to bag my ice
Tag a price on merchandise
Tell me, is it worth ya life?


No... it's a cold, cold, cold world
You can't be playing games with my life
I've gotta fight to survive, fight to stay alive


A-yo, metal pipes ignite, sparking fire, light the darkness night
Trying to stick me for my riches, now y'all bitches taking flight
Major business, raise the digits, tried to strike me for my life
Slice and dice, men or mice, GZA tell 'em what it's like


A-yo, money making, people flaking, Cash Rules, fuck the bacon
Earth's quaking, head is aching, bank stop, dice shaking
Times are hard, so are jobs, scheming niggas wanna rob
Use a hoe to slob ya knob, hit you with unruly mobs
Stab you in the back and smile, watch you bleed for a while
Hating on the agile, steal ya name and bite ya style
Hold you for a ransom note, Goliath cutting David's throat
Grab ya vest, abandon boat and leave you out at sea to float


Now with success and I've become a target
They wanna set me up, I guess more money equals more problems
They wanna hit me, wanna stick me, get me for my riches
They wanna diss me, want clip me, leave me stiff in ditches


And I can't take it.... no, no... but I'm gonna make it...
Yeah... oh... I'm gonna make it... ooh... yeah...
It's a cold, cold, cold world
I got my hand on my gun, they got a brother on the run
Yeah... it's a cold, cold, cold world
You can't be playing games with my life
I've gotta fight to survive, fight to stay alive
This ain't a game, this is my life
Keep pushing me to the edge, I'm gonna push back
And you won't like that, it's guaranteed you won't like that
When ya laid down, laid flat...




Oh yeah, coming through with my Shaolin crew
Two cent for a case, gimme St. Ide's brew
In the midst of broken bottles and crushed up cans
Methtical's in a jam, oh how dry I am


With St. Ides in my system
Crack another I'm blessed, let's go get the next one
And get over, the object is to stay sober
Lay on the sofa, better yet, dial my chauffeur


Call me the Wallabee Champ, sretched out, could never be son
Ricochet daily hit the deli for a cold one
Naturally blessed, yes, my rap is like a laser beam
That blows in the bushes, St. Ide's fill the canteen


Crack the bottle of the St. Ide's, sipping to those
Who don't realize that drinking ain't only to be drunk
You can't drive, keep my peoples alive
And if the Saint don't know you from a can of paint


It was hot on the spot so I jetted up the block
I saw Ak with an Ide's, I could tell by the dot
On the back he be building, not that charcoal filtered
Ice cold bottle tilted, to my cup he spilt it
Ahh St. Ides



(Intro)
There can be only one
Swisha house
Ashanti
Pall Wall what it do
Murder Inc

(Paul Wall)
It's the Houston hard hitter out the seven one three
It's the people's champ, Paul Wall yeah that's me
Come take a ride with the player out the Lone Star State
I'm just a hustler on the grind known for getting that cake
I came up from the bottom now I reside on the top
I used to run away from cops but now its Benzes I cop
I used to pump stuff on the block like Yao Ming on the paint
But now I pimp the parking lot drivin slow and sippin drink
With Ashanti on my side as I glide like Clyde
Ain't nothin less than with twenty-fours on my side
It's just something about the way I tip fours and grip grain
And got the boppers on the sideline going insane
I got them on it, my macking game is out of control
But I don't know if it's my looks or my big bank roll
I'm tweny-four years old with a mouth all gold
My game's cold and the story's been told, it's Paul Wall baby

(Ashanti)
See I dunno why (why) I'm feeling just the way I do (do)
It's been a long time (time), I thought that I was over you
But now you coming around again, I be remembering what you said
I just can't take it, and I don't wanna go back (oh no)

(Hook - Ashanti)
What is a girl to do if she still on it? (Yes)
And she done been there before with you, and now she don't want it (Yes)
It's been time and time again, I just wish this thing would end, tell me
What is a girl to do if she still on it?

(Ashanti)
Whenever we talked (talked), it feels like we had something strong (strong)
And knowing it's wrong (wrong), we tried to do this thing before
But when you coming real close to me, bringing back all the memories
I just can't fake it (fake it), but I don't wanna go back (Oh no)

(Hook)

(Method Man)
Ah, yea
Auntie Ashanti is a problem, the track here's a problem
The best thing rocking since that Cotton came to Harlem
Meth darling, I'm like that Hershey with the almond
And I don't beg for nothing but your pardon
They start and I finshed, my animals is starving for dentist
Straight up menace, y'all don't get involved in my business
Look eyewitness, spotted like a blemish all gimmicks
I'm 5950 authentic
Tilted with that NY on it, there's money to be made and I want it
See my palm been itching for the longest
But scratch that paper like NASDAQ we laugh at like
Roll the dice, get the cash back, I'm nice
Plus I got the juice so I go well wit ice
Been drug tested three times failed it twice
Ashanti you doing it big, don't hurt 'em auntie
Matter fact you killing 'em girl, you murder mami
Yea, yea



Hahahaha
Yea
This little something for your eardrums
Paul Wall, Swisha House
Method Man, Wu-Tang
Ashanti, the one and only princess
Hahahahaha yea

Part time call the nigga lovely but that ain't nuttin'
Before I die, I'm a leave the world with something
To remember me by the real stimuli
For you frontin' ass out rappers to capture
I rip the world apart like a natural disaster
I keep it live, something born in 85
Through the love of my 3rd eye got me thinking
Maybe you and I should get together for whatever
You never in your long-legged life had it better
Uh you got it now, we be loungin', Tical

Im from the killa killa hill, we keep it real consistent
For that dollar dollar bill, we will murder you in an instant
Fuck what your name is, youll be non-existent
If you ever try to show any form of resistance
Im strong in the hood. Im in a good position
When I walk they salute, when I talk they all listen
You acting the part like you in an audition
Where shoot outs in the parks is a daily tradition
This is modern warfare, we play with live ammunition
Shot you through your third eye, will change your whole disposition
The body never lie, call me the mortician
Every death has a story to tell, so pay attention
Premonitions on my life, slip the banana clip in
Never put your hat on the bed. Im a little superstitious
Got my black suit on, they say I am acting suspicious
Big gun in my palm, look like my arm is missing

 (x2)
Ayo one MC two MC
When my gun out, everybody goes down
Word on the street, these boys get butter
Fuck with me, nigga, cause this straight gutta


Got my black suit on, we get malicious
Hanz On checking in for the squad, he on his pivot
Got them big guns, make em disappear, call em wizards
Will oblige, till you meet your demise, this shit is physics
Mr. Barka newest gee on the block, he is the shizit
Suffer Mossberg wounds to ya frame, you move a smidgen
Hanz rollin with the man he the Meth, pay you a visit
Prerequisite have them all in the dirt. They all can get it
Used to percolate the crack in the pot, until it dried
Now I am occupying spots on your block, that shit is aye
And when we popping off the gun at your top, we make it pie
You better take another look at your seeds, and holla bye
Yo as far as mafuckas concerned, yo this is it

Block nigga shine like a 5D shutta

Scoop of French vanilla brought a duce duce with her

Like them boys from Cypress Hill said (how I could just kill a man)


Ayo one MC two MC

Fuck with me, nigga, cause this straight gutta




Yoooooooooo, sick ass niggas
Sick ass bitches, all the welcome
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah, come on, come on, come on
We don't need nooooooo, no cop patrol


I wish a nigga would, come through the hood, like Street won't
Jump out the woods, and snatch your goods
If you don't know by now, you should
Still actin' like you can't die tonight, you could
Still doubtin' the kid, like Street won't push back ya wig
Just for thinkin', it's not what it is
Shit, Shaolin, we back again, rap for yen
Streetlife, that nigga that'll tap your chin
Come get some, step to it, let's see
Where ya heart's at, let's do it
I hear you talkin', but take caution, before crossin'
The Street, before you end up layin' in a coffin
Don't sleep, you rap cats is physically weak
I don't care how much spins your records get in a week
Big Street, still beat you down with the heat
So umm, watch the words you speak, I roll deep


This is Street Education, tune in
(Rule one, watch them niggas close to you)
This is Street Education, tune in
(Rule two, make sure you do what you suppose to do)
This is Street Education, tune in
(Rule three, fuck the world, spit that shit)
This is Street Education, tune in
Adjust your radio station, let's begin


Who's playin' king of New York, y'all gangstas? Hold that thought
I'mma show you how we hold down the fort, I'm from a Shaolin resort
We don't ball, we catch bodies for sport
Put our high light on the news report
Muthafucka ya name, run up on you, and blast your frame
For that little piece of ice on your chain
Don't look at me strange -- like you don't know what this is
I know you feel the gun touchin' your rib, it's those Shaolin Kids


And we ain't scared to death, or scared to live
Put twenty two shots in your crib


The Stat, we at it again, put another ten shot through ya Benz
Leave you rollin' through the block, on your rims
We ain't gots to pretend, me and you, we ain't gots to be friends
So when you 'em


Be on needles and pins


This where the drama begins
I'm tellin' you pa, I'm out for revenge
Like a nigga tried to murder my kin, I won't bend




Adjust your radio station
Let's begin....
Adjust your radio station




Uh, and it goes like this
Uh uh uh uh, it goes like that
Now let me tell you who I am
Up early in the morning, dressed in black
Who dat? *echoes*


Yo yo
Marvel this theatrical, drama on stage
Broadway classical, led men to rage
Like currents, the beat change and now a flow is strange
You in the arctic wit wolves that viciously main
Thugs that roam clubs, in the dark wit fireworks that spark
Saltwater vibrations comin from sharks
Blood-thirsty kids bite just as well as I write
You're like secretaries who can't type, you're no use
Broke down vessels who want a boost, there's no jokes
Quick fast you, get stumped cuz you played, your organ pump
Kool-Aid, from Indiana wit the Jones of a Lost Crusade
Hip-hop done hit the church, choir girls rockin mini skirts
The b-side kept plenty hurt
Push like the shovels in snow storms
And stack piles of foul, the shit you must GROW ON! *echoes*

Chorus  4x
Uh and it goes like this
Uh uh uh uh, it goes like that


Pay no attention to the evil they speak
You caught the beef wit the equal eye, poisonous beats from underneath
Crack the concrete wit two left feet
Head on my meat
Ain't no games here we playin for keeps (WE PLAY FOR KEEPS!)
Introducing, the crowd seducing man on the street
Penitentiaries is either half-dead or too sweet
Back to basic, condition-al god, plus I can take it
Wagin war within the matrix, it's hard to see
Touch, hear, smell or even taste it, take your places
We runnin in these human races, bucking naked
Back-slappin kid yappin, actin villian catchin feelin like we cap peelin
As if we killin every brick in every project building
From Cabrini Green to Tildens, sincerely yours
Mista Meth and Maximilion (da millions, da millions)
(Ka ka ka ka ka ka ka KAAA!) (da millions ha!)

Chorus 5x


Uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh
Wu-Tang Killa Bees on the swarm (WE PLAY FOR KEEPS!)
(WE PLAY FOR KEEPS!)
Wu-Tang Killa Bees on the swarm
And it goes like this




Aight? Check it out (FUCK DAT!)
Word, niggas smoke too fuckin' much man
(Check it out y'all, check it check it out)


We can all get by if we want now
Get a fat piece of the pie if we want
Motherfuckers gettin' mad high when they want now
I will survive, recognize it be Tical


What up, ock?  Niggas is strapped, ready for war
On the ill block, things just ain't peace no more
Fuck it - if you ain't with me then forget me
Niggas tried to stick me, retaliation, no hesitation shifty (bitch)
Creepin' niggas in the dark, triggers with no heart
Rippin' ass apart, I be swimmin' with the sharks now (yeah)
Stay out my water or it's manslaughter
Kid, you oughta start reachin' for that nickle-plated auto-
Matic (f'real) my thoughts get sporadic (uh)
Loaded raps bustin' mad shots to ya attic (woo!)
They say this hazardous flow's a hazard
Straight from Hazzard County with a bounty on his head
And it said: "Wanted Dead or Alive"
I swear by the whites of they eyes
To never take a dive I will survive




Eeep opp, epp awpp, baaaaaaa
Here we go, start


Shit's gonna happen if niggas start actin'
Like they want problems. You want 'em? You got 'em
Rap contact, is writin' this exact-
Ly, the way it should, be, attack
Killer Beeeees on the swarm
Alaikum as-salaam, drops bombs like Qur'an
The ism helps to stimulate my pugilism
I bust rhymes like jism
Impregnate the rhythm with the wisdom
Decipher, the stee, I be hyper
I dwindle the style, that rekindle like old flamesss
Sssssssaliva, check the wicked flows I delyvah
Oops, I mean delivers like the Hudson River
Styles be trite, trife like a thief in the night
I be that sneaky-ass nigga bustin' nuts in yo wife
Blasted, buggin' off Bacardi and acid
Flippin' on the mic, it's a classic




Daddy's home, your daddy's home to stay


Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo same time same channel
Nasty vandals too hot to fucking handle
Bring the ruckus to all you knotty head fuckas
Shit's like Hammer Time, niggas can't touch us


Straight up and down Wu-Tang forever
Come tougher than DJ ?'s leather
Make a better tomorrow
Condition your atmosphere, air like feathers
The fire come, transmit vire come
The higher sire come, we burn your wire
Wu-Tang be number one...


Four years ago a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was Meth and it went this way

Yo, we took a test to become an MC
All the withers in the crowd got amazed at me
God threw me inside his Cadillac
The chaffuer drove off and we never came back

Meth cut the record down to the bone
And now I rock solid chrome microphones
Now we signing autographs, with cheers and laughs
Champagne, caviar, and bubblebaths, but see...

That's the life that I lead, you sucka MC, we G-O-D
Take that and move back, or catch a heartattack
Because there's nothing in the world the gods could ever lack

I chill at the party in my b-boy stance
Walk, cap low, 45 in my pants
Fly like a dove, that come from up above
My nigga's Iron Lung but you can stay one love

It's just a one two three a three a two one
Throw your blunts in the air for the god Iron Lung
Blow them right in your face with the bass
You messed up, come in first place, the real rap taste

First come, first serve basis
Coolin out boo, take you to the def places
One of a kind for you people's delight
And to you sucker MC, you know it ain't right
Bet you bite all your life, cheat on your wife
Run in a gun fight with nuthin but a knife
Bangin with your boy, slingin with the crew
And everybody know what you've been through
It's the one two three three two one
Throw your blunts in the air for your dunn Iron Lung
Smoke in your place with the highs and the bass
Come in first place in the real rap race
Go uptown, buy a bag of brown
You sucker MC, a sad face clown
Gettin OD ready to rock crowds steady
You drive a big car get your gas from Getti


I'm ODB in the place to be
Didn't go to St. John's University
In the streets of Brooklyn I aquired the knowledge
A Law of Mathematics that's higher than college
I'm fly on skins that I gets in Queens
She love filthy swine and my collard greens
I'm dressed to kill, you know our style
Cause niggas don't know that Dirty Dogg fly

If you wanna see me baby come, you know Dirty Dog is number one


I wrote this song about the (?)
You gotta know where to start when the beats play





Daddy's home, your daddy's home to stay


Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo same time same channel
Nasty vandals too hot to fucking handle
Bring the ruckus to all you knotty head fuckas
Shit's like Hammer Time, niggas can't touch us


Straight up and down Wu-Tang forever
Come tougher than DJ Run's leather
Make a better tomorrow
Condition your atmosphere, air like feathers
The fire come, transmit vire come
The higher sire come, we burn your wire
Wu-Tang be number one...

Smoke in your place with the highs and the bass
Come in first place in the real rap race
Go uptown, buy a bag of brown
You sucker MC, a sad face clown
Gettin OD ready to rock crowds steady
You drive a big car get your gas from Getti


I'm ODB in the place to be
Didn't go to St. John's University
In the streets of Brooklyn I aquired the knowledge
Allah Mathematics that's higher than college
I'm fly on skins that I gets in Queens
She love filthy swine and my collard greens
I'm dressed to kill, you know our style
Cause niggas don't know that Dirty Dogg fly

If you wanna see me baby come, you know Dirty Dog is number one
X2

I wrote this song about the (?)
You gotta know where to start when the beats play
X2

Dino the dart specialist
Knahmean?
Golden Arms, yo
Meth-Tical, John John do your thing thing
What? Check it


The all eye seein, heavenly divine
The truth brings out, the temper in my spine
A Hill sound again, feelin symptoms that bit me
I feel for you victims, with everything up in me (uh-huh)
A head ringa, stuffed in sidewalls of frenzy
Back the fuck up, cause I'm stimmi off the Remi
A semi bloodshot eye, donkey dick of nuts
Every cut, I split and try and felt the guts (what?)
Nigga what, earthquakin speech, woofer hissin
The razor faced victims, WHEW, that's what kissed em
Appropriate precaution, surroundin, certain it curtains
I'm dumbfounded, I'm poundin, the pavement
For mental enslavement, I'm cravin, a misbehavin savior
America the grave for gun wavers (what?)
The wave runners, what the blood seed again
Make you wonder, about the thunder underneath the skin (hmm)
The sapphire rhymes slap fire out your minds
With right timin, bite with vampire rhymes


Hmm, I spy, with my crooked eye
Full metal street soldiers, born to die
Put em up yeah fuck yeah, when it's Hammertime
Niggas can't be touched here, the true and livin
Night vision unseen, like Gene
When I hack men The Unforgiven, left in prison
In the Wu-Tang dirty dungeon, now you succumbin
To my twelve part dirty dozens, flabbergasted
By tracks that be True Mastered, opposites attract
Beef plus they ass backwards, stick yourself
Til I'm felt, this ass whoopin, is bein dealt
Like hot beans-and-butter nigga, I got the belt
What the deal huh? Swing low, sweet chariot
I walk the Underground Railroad, with Harriett
Just a slave to the rhythm - victims I'm like alien
About to put that shit up in em, I Can't Live
Without My Radio, a 100 Miles and Runnin
T2 Judgment day comin, nobody's safe
When I reminisce about Case, still hit the staircase
When the coppers give chase, I give em finger
The only hip-hop singer, to tell America
To kiss his Killer Bee stinger, nothin can save ya
From this major misbehavior, heavy hands
Layin corners in the elevator, guard your grill


I speculate, get my darts straight, don't exaggerate
Dictate, do it with the Papermate, set the plate
Set the bait, checkmate, fuckin with cha mental state
Double take, meditate, earthquake, VGL contemplate
Big boys integrate; catch you at the sess skate
Army tank, high rank, got the bank
Got the shank talk the talk walk the walk from New York
To Up North to downstate to L.A., to all day
To cliches to instant replays, to all the DJ's
To BJ's in the PJ's, equality days
With money like legs I plant eggs, Pele roundhead
The dog bred, snakes runnin from red, catch dead
Raekwon is on, take your uniform, we perform
Shit like gangs in Now Born, check for new Don
Fuck a Yukon, you been warned, we the realest
We never were conned, duffed out and knowledge born

Suspect chin niggas, no win niggas
Send niggas back to go, try again niggas
All hail me, the good the bag the ugily
The money's around your way, lovely
Where for art thou Meth-tical god-child
I pack a smile like crocodile profile
Can't hold it down? oh the shit gon' hit the fan now
Spin around let your whole crown man down, man down


I live by the street code never old
Never love a ho, never flash the dough
Cause you never know who friend or foe
Got block control solid gold thought
Before the blow lets stroll through the ghetto
Habitat with no parole
Never snitch switch which
Keep a fresh pair of kicks
Split the tongue snatch the weed
In case the cops wanna strip search
Think first prepare for the worst
When you do dirt
Remember there's a million other niggas with the same thirst


No doubt dummy out
Bets pull the money out
Niggas walk a funny route
This is what its all about?
Young guns and dum-dums
Slum bums and sons
Askin' niggas where they come from
Get him for his one, um
Sunshine, its crunch time
Stranded on the front line
Ducking from the one-time
Niggas on the run, where the cameras can't come, ha
Make this one the anthem
Ring around the rosie
Pocket full of Grants, uh


Just because you wild in the club you ain't thug
Sport gloves and gold mugs you ain't thug
Tattoos and hard screws don't make you thug
Sucker for love catch a slug, nigga


Suspect chin niggas, no win niggas
Send niggas back to go, try again niggas
Shotgun slammin' in your chestpeice, blaow
Shotgun slammin' in your chestpeice, blaow


Carry your eyes and avoid spots
Cellblocks rap blow you for your slide(?)
Time what you got's mine
We can take it to the yellow lines and we can pull nine
Whether the rhyme or the crime Ima still shine
Heavy on the street talk cut your life support short
Never had no love for you so there is no love lost
Strictly enforced by the street stories get double crossed
Hands off I run with the torch


They got me fed up from the head up
Put up or shut up
On stage in them shiny get-up
These niggas is funny
Energizer bunny actors
They hustle backwards
Son I think they gay rappers
Say word, drop some stature
Dog splash ya, party crash ya
The spell casta
Heard the same before and after its over
Flood get your brain end the game, done its over
End of the line out of time bitch its over
On the wrong street with no heat he was sober
We soldiers somebody should've told ya




With the W burning through your flesh
Verbally possesed never second guess
Blow minds like David Koresh
Fuck a vest you need a gun to protect your assets
Deep in the aztecs break out before the sun set
Street wars gimme yours crime is what I live for
Got rhymes galore next time its at the wu store
If you sleep late, next date is at the cest gate
All you sober mcs, I leave y'all niggas half-baked


Microphone is in a choke hold
Losin' control bringing drama by the boatload
It takes drama
In the pillage now of cappadonna
My split persona hit their village and their baby mama
Y'all niggas playing with this money while we stay hungry
And kept it pudgy it won't make me have to crash, dummy
Before its over
You should keep your chain tucked in
And should never run your mouth with a suspect chin
Now lay it down








Excuse me gorgeous..


Just maxing, looking for hoes, y'know, relaxing
Met this redbone Jasmine, midtown Manhattan
Shot a verb, that tranked her nerves, calm words
Massaged the mentals, made her pussycat purr
Sweet Love you look miraculous, brown-eyed passionate
High cheek-boned, Tommy Girl cologne you smashing it
Jump in, take a spin, destination Staten
I have you home by ten, shorty started laughing
She replied, "Street, you ever ride while you drive?"
I looked puzzled, and said, "Nah baby why?"
She pressed up, grabbed my dick, threw her dress up
Cocked her legs, cold fucked my head up
Now I'm deep in it, flying past the speed limit
Out of control, still whipping it, steadily hitting it
Deep stroking, one hand on the wheel, blunt smoking
Loving how it feel, sweet Love you got me open, what?


Love is love Love, love is love Love
Love is love Love, love is love Love
We connected like a train from the first ordeal
I stepped to her with the passion as I kept things real
But like, sex was on my mind like, cum was in my pants
I flashed my fronts on her, like if I had a chance
She said, "Ain't you Cappadonna from the Wu-Tang Clan?"
I said, "Yeah, mad gear plus the small white band
Sweet Love, I want your pussy can I be your man?
Stripped to the bare essentials let me fuck you if I can
Sweet Love, from your nipples to your pussy nub"
Sweet Love, love is Love, love is love Love


It's a full moon, we in the bedroom, thoughts consumed
By the passion, slow jam tunes and body action
My finger's on the clit splashing, your pussy lips
Got you spazzing, love juices, marinating
In your satins, sexy ass, I gets em like my old dad
I love my women bad, with just a little touch of class
You'se the Star by far, look at you ma
Shake your thang-thang girlfriend, you Shay Shay La Fah!
Whattup, went to beat it up, I'm not the one to eat it up
But the type to hit it raw dawg and seed it up
We talk without sayin nuttin', you told me if I came through
You'd gimme som'thin', now we locking ass
Pulling hair and talking trash, how you like it
Slow or fast? She said, "I like it when it last"
No doubt, you got the best trout there can be
Not an everyday, average, Chicken of the Sea
Candidate for H.I.V, you'd rather deal with monogamy
Queen to be held, Black Mahogany
You're 'bout to bust damn it, sugar walls coming down
Now you can't stand it, you've been touched
That's when I felt the blood rush
Getting closer and closer with every thrust, take me there
Volcano's about to erupt, I love you much
Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts



In order to keep the broad You're gonna have to not do it to her body You got to do it to her mind man




Im that OG, some of yall know me
I used to cop greens from 4G, nickels, dimes and ozs
Im like Thors brother, so low key
I might swing a hammer, provoke me
Put a shooter where Ko - be
Tell ya like somebody done told me
Never trust nobody who owe me and any wife is a trophy
If Meth the mortician, you know that shovel is on me
To put em in the earth, I do my dirt all by my lonely


Im all about the Benjis
But that bring jealousy and envy
Dont trust niggas, they smile it seems friendly
Ill be damned if I pass up
Its for bricks when I mask up and run down
On em to get my cash up
Cash Verrazano J Reeds is getting lined up
Sam Rothstein when I lean slump with the 9 tucked
Come and take a trip to the dark side
Fuck around with pigs, they gonna find your body hog-tied
No guys saying they neutral but playing both sides
Homicide housing young cartel with dope tides
Your boy aint playing a little
Have em engraving a tombstone with your name in the middle


Fugitive on the run, felony warrants
The police, kicking doors, question all the informants
Carlo, feeling like the wars on and Im running through Hell
Blunt in my mouth, gasoline draws on
Vocals, got a laser beam, no other option for you
Die or embrace the team, offers that you cant refuse
Handz On music, motherfucker, yeah say it with me
Now get your smart phone hater and take a picture with me
Consigliere, no phones, Jimmy whisper to me
Ride til I win the war, Cops put a clip in me
Carlos, got killers on the payroll, Killers on the lay-low
Killers that will kill when I say so


Theres a war going on outside, nobodies safe from
I gotta get this money now, we gon take some
A politicing with these clowns, bout to shake something
Im gonna hit em with the pounds, thatll break something
Yall better run and get your boots time tight black
Yall fornicating with this money, get your life rap
Straight music, motherfucker cause its like that
I come and hit em in the dark, call it nightcap
And I be fucking with the starks, he my ace boon
Dont let us catch you in these parts or we gon' bake rooms
And yo them cats you running with, yo they some fake goons
Im bout to sweep em in the finals, gonna shake brooms
The situations getting chunky, tension mad thick
Like you could cut it with a knife, cloak and dag shit
Hanz baby, PLO on some Arab shit
My killahs coming with them cannons, bout to blast shit


Streetlife chip off the old block, the hard rock
Apply pressure to your neck til your heart stops
Got em all lean like codeine, microphone fiend
Im an addict, Im addicted to rap cream
New day is dawning but Im stuck in my old ways
Gave you fair warning, Im reloading, okay?
I aint gotta say its on, pop up at your front door
Early morning, guns drawn, like ding dong


Cash, I get it up, my niggas, I cant get enough
Wont stop rocking til Im sitting up on Diddy bucks
A semi tuckin, witty fucker, picture getting city stuck
This city buck is sick of flipper, motherfuckin city bus
Big whip, coasting, throat stroking, slow motion
Slow groove, so smooth, old school, Billy Ocean
Caribbean Queen, mean body, Dereon jeans
Cherry bomb, the way she blow me, she like  dreams
Enough with the petty con schemes, I need Enron cream
Short minute before I end up with that Benz on lean



 Yeh.. Erick Sermon.. EPMD.. check it

Verse 1: 
Erick and Parrish Millenium Ducats
Hold me down, hold me down (*echoes*)..

We keeps cool, no need for static, I strap tools

Yo P!
Time to rock, the sound I got, it reigns hot
Makin necks snap back, like a slingshot
E hustle, and muscle my way in
Then tussle for days in, on my own with guns blazin
Not for the fun of it, just for those who want me to run it
Then leave them like -- who done it?
Sucka duck, I do what I feel right now
When I spit the illest shit, cats be like, "Wow!"
YO! I get looks when I'm in the place
That's that nigga, makin you +Smile+ with Scarface

My style dirty underground, or Ukraine po'
When it hits you, pain pumps Kool-Aid, through the vein and shit
Snatch the trap then I Dash like Damon did
Doc, walk _Thin Red Lines_ to shell shock
Hairlock with fuckin broads in nail shops
Hydro? Got more bags than bellhops
Two thousand Benz on my eight by ten PICTURE
Papichu', slayin crews in ICU

Rollin down like dice in Yahtzee fool!

With ten kids with hammers, hooked to a camper!
Yo next up

 Yo yo, get on the mic for the Symphony


Youth on the move, payin them dues, nuttin to lose
Huh, street kids, broken and bruised, eyein yo' jewels
Huh, bad news bearin' they souls through rhyme and blues
"Hardcore!" To make them brothers act fool
Hands on the steel, flip you heads over heel *sniff*
Smell the daffodils from the lyric overkill *sniff*
Feelin like the mack inside a Cadillac Seville *screech*
Too ill, on cuts, the Barber of Seville - fi-ga-ro!
The sky is fallin - GERONIMO!

In Japan they call me Ichiban
Wu-Tang Clan, numba won!

 BASTARD!
 Get on the mic and rock the Symphony


Mrs. Stop Drop and Roll, rocks top the told
Hot, even though dames is froze
Pop close range at foes, and blaze them hoes
Leave em with they brains exposed, and stains on clothes
Y'all better change your flows, hear how Luck spittin?
Stay drunk-pissed in the S-Type, stay whippin *screech*
When the guns spittin, duck or get hittin
It's written, we in the game but ball different
Point game like Jordan, y'all play the role of Pippen

MAN LISTEN, stop your cryin and your bitchin
Like E and P's last CD, you're out of business

Welcome to the fish fry where niggas get burnt to a crisp
Jump out the pot, "Yeah yo I got this"
Long armor, construction's on, I'm pro-drama
Catch me in the wildest beefs, I bring bombers
Bearded like Talibans, booted, my black ninjas
'll come through, tuxedos on with the gold llamas
Priceless like emeralds, check out the ski mask
King Tut's nephew gave it to me for three bags
Of heron, Don Baron, sniff a bag of blow
Fifth out, runnin' up in Saks with the ill army
Shake feds, play dead, yo check out what Rae said
Lay on ya hands, let the Branson break bread
High energy, all my niggas a kin to me
Regardless how it go down I still get ten a ki
Beware of my enemies, y'all remember me
Nikes with the low goose on and I've been a beast
Wilding in my headphones, red in my stones
Good ganja out, if I die fill up my headstones
With water, dough, acid and gold classics
All my niggas who pump, the spirit'll jump out and grab shit
Max with the laser on 'em, staircase caskets (caskets)
Broke bugged thugs in the hallway maxing (maxing)

 + (movie sample)
Still them 1-6-Ooh niggas, straight up (whoa, hold up, hold up)


The nozzle aim rip through ya frame for pocket change
Fiend for the Rush Hour 4 then pop a vein
Thousand dollar corks pop, pause or get off top
Used to be a general, just lost your spot
Animal House, two grand'll handle ya mouth
Beast mode with the G-Code cancel 'em out
Son, I've seen Hell, fell into the palms of Satan arms
Don that I am made 'em bow in the face of God
Graveyard Shifting, different day, the same thing
The name ring then the chain swing and dames cling
Money green, Maury kicks, whips and new fitteds
(It was all a dream) Advocated by the few who do live it
Bloomberg make a nigga cop the Mausberg
Shorty ain't a shorty, he a shooter like Wahlberg
Old man told me, "Don't be blind to deception
Only strive for perfection homey, ya mind is a weapon"


Relax, you got ya muscles tight, relax

Before you even had a name, you was screaming "Wu-Tang"
(We gon' take it back with this)
When we was running on the block, you was under ya pops, remember
(We gon' take it back with this... let's go)


Armor truck money, Shazam bangles, play the throne like
Julius Caesar, gorilla mob, slash, Killah's gaurd
Fake passports and visas, all of my goons
They be carrying spoons because boom he had a massive seizure
Hot chocolate lovers, guns is published
Detroit bitches out of town be dying to fuck us
This is real talk, shank lullabyes
Ben Franks, we like Jet Blue we stay hella high
Curl on the dumbell L, we can't even S-P-E-L-L
MTV or TRL's
Supreme novelists, we rank superior, guarding the post
Down low in the 'jects, got it locked in ya area
Ain't tryna hurry up
We like rebel niggas powdered up wilding in the streets of Liberia
No matter the crime, I'm beating the case
If I'm a wrong, a chair hit a judge right in his face
Shitting shanks out, come to court dates
Mittens on shines with blood Wally's that's the color of wine


Talk to me, my criminal mystique
Kick back the boards, six thousand a week
Pay homage, what the don beat, you're a minor threat
I see ya sweat roll down ya cheek
And ya soft and sweet, ya talk is pork
Get murdered in New York when I enforce the heat
And the cost ain't cheap, my advice is priceless
Bring back the life that ya thought was lifeless
The way of the gun, son, who the nicest?
S.K., no stun gun, smooth devices
Time crisis, I played the game, low lifers
In a brawl, ripped the phones out the walls in Rikers
Vipers in the infirmary rooms with slicers
Shiesters with hate in their blood might bite ya
Fuck that bitch if yo wife don't write ya
Cancel her, buy another one just like her
Pipers in the bucket of ice taste righteous
Today's mathematics when we build in cyphers
The baby automatic kill like Air Force strikers
I'm still Asiatic when I spill the hypeness


The dark, and this place will come here
That's right!







Spinning the b-b-beats for the streets
It's the Bomb Squad DJ
We getting you crunk right now
Get down or lay down
Take it like a motha fuckin' man


He's Mr. Take The Heat, Mr. Baby Rub My Feet
Mr. Don't Be Hanging Late In Streets
Mr. Bring Home The Bacon, Mr. You Ain't Hear Enough
Mr. Pack Your Shit, Mr. Do It To Me Rough
Mr. Please, Drop Me At My Job
Mr. Please, I Need A Hundred Dollars To Borrow
Mr. Please, Can I Use Your Car
If any man can do all this, he got to be a bad boy


Fast women and fast cars
A razor blade instead of a tongue, my game sharp
We major leaguers, minor leaguers, get out the park
Bitches, that wanna back talk, get out and walk
I'm too cold, like Iceberg Slim
Ya'll see, I'm caked up with icing
Rolling on dubs, thug for lifing, never trifling
And I ain't never met a piece of pussy I ain't liking
I'm too piping, hot, front, you get got, kid
Don't get too close, because you might get shot




Okay, come out and play
Ya'll clowns Need to get down, or get out the way
I'm a live round, shot to your head by Doc Dre
Ain't too long, ya'll gon' live on consignment and not pay
This is everyday, life of the kid, fuck who it is
I'm gon' live like a true bad boy, and do it big
And I could take it, it's just as good as I get
And ya'll ain't gotta ask, dead rapper your ass, kid
Who anti-everything, ya'll niggas is for
Who eat up everything on his plate, then eat yours
Ain't got no table manners at all, I'm off the wall
Like I'm MJ, jerking myself, scream at your frog
And bitches wanna give us the drawers, cuz who we are
The same bitch'll sugared your tank and key your car
The life of a player and pimp, who every dollar, tax exempt
Pussy paying the rent, now who I'm is?




Oh I'm a bad boy, fast cars, hot women
The lifestyle, accustomed to winning
Bitch, your chrome is spinning, tinted windows
But still, you're jailed from the head bopping gangsta lean
You'se a bad boy, champagne, diamond studded events
Red carpet rollout, pulling up in a Bent'
And the crowd, they taking pictures
It's hard to tell, if a flash went off
Or you was blinded by the riches




Smoking, choking up in this bitch
Mr Meth, DJ Lethal collaboration
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it goes like this, check it out, check it out
Yo, yo, yo


Guess who's coming to dinner, put up or shut up
Sit on your ego, when I'm fed up, should of never ended
The missintentions of a Meth Man
I'm sorta like a CEO from Def Jam, minus the 'yes men'
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
I spit things, pop out my neck like shark gill
Live evil, DJ Lethal if you will
My kin's in the kitchen, I got for the kill
I'm like that, beyond "thunderdome", Mad Max
Like I'm pissed off, busting on a urinery track
Infection, it burns, anyone that step in my direction
Time to count your money, and your blessings


They like it, when he talk dirty like that
They like it, when he talk dirty like that
Opposites attract, time to face facts
When you bite me, I bite back
Now everybody wanna talk about, hip hop, hop music
Talk about, hip hop, hop music
Talk about, hip hop, hop music
Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop music


It's that state of the art, shit, business man
Formerly known as the artist
If ya'll ain't with me, then forget me
Cuz if I go broke, nothing gon' fix me
Except crispy, hundred dollar bills and fifties
Here's the main course, indeed, bringing it often
The starving for attention M.C.'s, stomachs is talking
About these New York'ns, witty
Who that got appettite for hot scorching plates
Make Little Annie Orphan
Sorta like Kurt Cobain, blowin' his brains
With these lyrics, and funk that 'smells like teen spirit'
Lookin' high, but hold up, look in they eye
And you see crook, coming from that Crooked Letter I




Now gag yourself wit the spoon
Tical 0: Dj Lethal, this coming soon
Jo Lethal, I'd rather play the odds, fuck equals
Besides, that's the sugar soften tooth to the people
All my people, up til now, you heard it all
And ya'll trying to shit on my lawn, curb your dog
Know just where to find him, at four twenty, son
But the Meth ain't gon' hit ya til 4:21
Now that's game, can't call it, can't complain
Just do the damn thing, like Nike shoe campaign
Yeah, boo, I hit you with a backstage pass
As long as you know, you giving up some backstage(ass)

Blood money mercenaries, think you can muscle Wu?
It's a foot race, who can out-hustle who?
Hip hop junkie flunky, monkey see, monkey do
Great minds connect like mobster rings
Sit back, let me do my, Sinatra thing
I'm in the Hip Hop Hall of Fame, on the wall is the plaques
Old ball and chain, I named her Madam X
She love big cannons, sex unprotected
You better respect it, kid, we 'bout to set trip
You get ya neck ripped, eyeballs are scoping
I don't sell crack, I sell dopium
Catch him at the podium, nah, he moving too fast
Professor X, behind the bulletproof glass
You need a Wu pass, a bag of that high
Easy with the flicks, baby, I'm camera shy

Get that money, God, keep your sword sharp (1-2-3-4)


We might have to 8 Diagram one of y'all MC's
We grind everyday and we hustle for cheese
Got our face on the front of CD's, we off the hook
W.T.C. y'all soft and shook
Y'all not built like the Cuban Linx Clan that get CREAM
And back heads down every time we sing
Give us a hundred grand for a show, let us rock
For more money, more chicks, more private stock


They call me Streetlife, slap the taste
Out ya mug, know ya place, you ain't thug, fix ya face
Throw a slug, catch a case
Meanwhile, beat trial, back on that cash cow
Getting CREAM, however, a street brother know how
Point blank, I'm pulling rank, calling shot, I got bank
Pass the rock, my hand's hot, hit 'em with the showshotter
Peace to my ala mater, Wu-Tang block scholars
Never settle for less, promoters pay us top dollar

The Clan'll talk, Calabama niggas all'll quit
Talking that short dick shit, we was s'posed to be cool
Only the clue's on the other end of the stick
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Over-crowded police blood bamboo bimbo
Chickenhead skeezer crackrock hoodrat
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Barney here is down to a feeding dreadlock
Armpit like two Buckwheat's in a headlock
Macy Gray's hair between your leg lock
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Ya mother's so cross-eyed, when she cry tears roll down her back
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
{*coughs*} This shit is strong, god damn, what you got in there?
Over-crowded police blood bamboo bimbo
Chickenhead skeezer crackhead hoodrat
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Ya mother's so cross-eyed, when she cry tears roll down her back
Calabama niggas all'll quit
Talking that short dick shit
Speak up, no loud speaker but I'm speaking loud
Venacular ass kicking, truth got there in crowd
Shit, they call me the lethal lip
The linguistic, full metal jacket of venacular ballistic
Shooting out at the mouth without Chap or Blistec
Here's a mothafucka, I didn't flunk diaper rash
I'm verbally toxic, metal-piercing, forked, hollow point tongue
Dum dum, pow, shot from gattling gums
Hooked on phonics, packing a vicious vocabulary
Malicious, with malice and mayhem
Fuck a dictionary, give me the mic and I'll slay
Them and literally poetic symptoms
Pissing me the fuck off, missing me with that shit
I stick a venacular foot so far up in ya ass
You won't be able to pass verbal gas
So far in ya ass that one of my knees will rise so far above ya head
And you drown of a poetic ass kicking
Leaving lyrical lacerations on your lungs, from a verbal hangnail
That hung on my big toe, as I flow upward
Kicking yo on ya eardrum, you wanna hear some?
Tap dance on ya tonsils, leaving kiwi shoe polish on ya breath
Cavity in ya best rhyme, and I'm the access on the rest
Call me the proverbial verbal menacing dentist
With the drill, I got lyrical skills
I could perform oral root canals
It's unwise to fuck with me
Kick ya wisdom teeth down ya throat
Leaving you to choke
On where it hurts, unspoken vocals
Tying down ya vocal cord and windpipe tight
With toe jamming and ya mothafucking hemmoroids
Fuck the dumb shit...




Whooooo! Yo yo yo, yo yo
Huh.. {*inhales*}..
Yo VANGLORIOUS
This is protected, by the Red

 and TICAL
 Slap it down
 Way out of bounds
 Throw in the towels
 'fore we gun down


Yo, flipmodes, toilet bowls explode
When Doc, come drop a shitload
Grip fo's, mushrooms, did those
Dee pistol-whip hoes, a bitch owes
Money, bro I stick a zip code
Tiptoed, before Doc hit skid row
Thirsty? Sniffin out a pig nose
My Benz built with wings and 6-0's
My flows is, North Pole cold
My hands got areas to fit snow
Doc, mixin hoes and disco's
My dogs, let em walk with ripped clothes
Shows, niggas pack six rows
We're losin him! His heart won't get pulse
Crack your backs off a ten percent dose
Lip closed? I can hum and shit gold

Chorus: Redman

 Tear the roof off the mother (repeat 8X)
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Back up, don't make me shoot y'all
You don't, want to fuck with us, you don't


I gets down, rip sound, with this stick style
Pist-al, lick round, get off my dick now
Get crabbed, hostile, you kids is all sound timid
Scared to get in it, these dogs is Rockwild'
Unchained, untamed, you know my name
Act strange, pack flame, it's not a game
Just ill flows, that kills shows, you can feel yo
Kickin in you do', like a steel toe, for real doe
Y'all gon' learn, I spit germs
When you come short on Big Worm, you get burned
Punks don't get turned, they get done, and get sun
Come get some, the last vict-im, lie in a ditch
Now who wanna fuck with Hot Nikk'
Niggas chew gum with they ass and pop shit
Me and Funk Doc get, toxic
A bowl of rice and some chopsticks
Go make your Wu, just imposters

Chorus


Try to O.K. Corral with Doc and Meth Tical
Bar saloon fight, without weapons out (YEE-HAH!!)
Strech marks, like belly on Kevin ?Lous?
One yard to score, only second down
Hoes play wifey, wanna settle down
Tryin to lock cash? Bitch better bounce
Boyfriend jump in, Meth shut him down
Pound to echo loud, bout seven miles
Doc, Dirty Jersey hunt em down
Uncut, rhymes won't even fit the file
Baddest man out the bunch, pick him out
Drunk with a gun, miss you hit the crowd
Snitches, someone kiss to stitch your mouth
Wilder then winos on liquor droughts
Mrs. Howell, Mary-Ann, dig em out
Ginger watch, with the gun in Skipper mouth
Love Da Ruckus, and love to dish it out
Pre-washed MC's, start rinsin out
Get your whole camp put on the missin file
Pushin twelve out, bumpin digital

Chorus


We Just-Ice, men or mice, ain't nuttin nice
(Fuck your life) Your type just too light to fight
We move right, on Fright Night, when niggas bite
We bust pipe, 'pon does that suck tight
We alright, you all hype and all tripe
In the Source with half mic, you half liked
And half dead, blasted on flatbed
I'm past dead, eyes red, the hash head
Burn somethin, earn somethin and learn somethin
Take my turn frontin, Def Jam ain't heard nuttin yet
Suspect, ruffnecks, book em Dano
You get bust-ed, never leave home without my mustard
Trust this, out for justice, clown
And caught on Judgement Day, call Joe Brown
Take MC's to town if they starbound
Ashes to ashes, they all fall down
Master you bastards with hazardous tactics
Semi-automatic full rap metal jacket
Blasted in plastic your brain on the mattrress
All you kids is ass-backwards and vice-a versa

Chorus


Come on, yo tear the roof off
Nigga, yo tear the roof off
Back up, don't make me shoot y'all
You don't, want to fuck with us, you don't
Huh..
Yo, you don't want to fuck with us, you don't
Yo, you don't want to fuck with us, you don't




Uh huh, No I.D

Come on, come on, come on, come on, yeah, yeah, yo, yo, yo


Now that I got you in the mood, it's way past time ya shook dude
Cause I'm the best thing since cooked food
Holler at your frog, I'll be at the lily pad near the log
And let me drop it off in them drawers
Baby doll, hood ? with sugar walls
That talk back to ya like, nigga you shoulda called
Word, the kid got a thing for big curves
Might find him down on Sesame Street with big birds
Big pimpin', all dames is all game
So fine with her beautiful mind, she all brain
A head docter, get it poppin' like Reddenbacher
Chicks call me gravel pit dick, the bed rocker
Big John Studda, motherfuck who fuck mother
Gots you covered like Magnum XL rubber
Easy does ya, but we never love her
Ya down for the get down girls, go work at Dubya's ohhhh

Hey ladies, oh baby, ya all crazy

From sun down to sun up, I stay on the bone
Like I'm creeping on the come up, get it, got it, I'm gone
Now I got hun, riding shotgun
Windows halfway down, cause she a hot one
Love it when them chicks pop shit, and pop gum
My team cuttin' but we ain't cuppin', finger fuckin' everything cluckin'
Baby I'm frostbitten iceberg slim into black women
When Three's Company ask pigeon who Jack trippin'
Man listen, money slippin, it's honey dippin'
And if she come up missin', don't worry she went pimpin'
Ya gotta be, down with the cause before ya come
Down with the drawers, how many of y'all down with menage

Know you got good sex for me, tell me what comes next for me
Give me one reason to stop teasin', cause I
Know you got good sex for me, tell me what comes next for me

I know of those promises, of love and affection (come on, steady good ma)
There's something about you, that's got me going (uh huh, uh huh)
But is it worth not knowing if you're gonna be around (now, now)


Who the fuck is your daddy, and who your king girl
Are you unhappily married, don't see no ring girl
Soul sister, can't get ya to hell with ya
At the players ball, Cinderella lost her Chanel slipper
Now that's flavor neighbor, shake what ya momma gave ya
Twist, stick and move like Layla, call you maana later
I love the misbehavior, no minor, miss ya major
No finer chick can ?
God bless the bitch that made ya

Now go back to doing whatchu was doin, when you was doin' it, gone

Gimme one reason, gimme one reason, gimme one reason
Gimme one reason, gimme one reason, tell me what comes next for me




Homicide Housing... the Animalz here


Yo, I'm staying seldom when I sleep, I don't believe in dreams
I'm dead off in New York, so I believe in beams
And since the self reservation first, I'mma be blazing first
If not, what the fuck I'm suppose to leave my seed
Heavy coke across the ferry boat, to feed my fiends
Steady to off and quote a note, so I could lead my team
Park militant, deputy colonel, Park killing it
Civilians be stuck on my Island, we call 'em Gilligan
To got, pop Don for sure, Sean John valor
Regular-regular, Glock palm armed for war
Slama drama, keep the llama in the line of my croth
The bottom line is that I'm a problem of course
It's all problems, I'mma probably cost
The way my gun, battle your fort, standing ovations
Plus I clap at your mans in rotation, demanding donations
Then go to hand-to-hand on occassion
I ain't going, nowhere, it's like I'm stamped to the pavement
For my House Gang grant a vacation


My Loose Linx is off the chain, all my dogs bite
Rabies rip off they fangs, that's what New York like
Riders exposure, we live composers
It's Loose Linx, Staten Island, livest soldiers
Niggas in here, high and sober, looking at me wilding
Pushing through the crowds, you know I'm out to get over
It's a Loose Linx invasion, your man Carlton Fisk paper chasing
Reeping for gangsters in Green Haven
Who seen paper, networked for something major
Fuck behind the wall, being used for slave labor
It's Homicide Housing, I'm your next door neighbor
Now feel me and my prisoner's song, a deadly melody


Yo, my style's vulgar, push the new steel blue rover
Sting like king cobra, slap box your Hova
Timbo's I drag 'em, dime birds I bag 'em
Allen Key face on an automatic magnum
For real thugs, keep a gun, mask and glove
It's the Darkman, I come to make you taste your blood
Take a breather, unlace my Jordans, fuck a diva
Inhale like a Sing-Sing prisoner, puffin' cheeba
My team catch bricks, like passes to wide receivers
I used to have a name plate belt, with a Caesar
Now I got a mack, with braids, and a Visa
Writing rhymes, drinkin' Valentine, on my leisure
Your wifey, I please her, adultery style
Fuck her raw, while smoke come from poultry pounds, it's Darkman


Parental, discreation, advised (vised)
We interrupt your regular scheduled program for something live (live)
(Ya'll better realize, ya'll better realize
Television telling lies to your vision, yo)


Yo, ask BET how I'm living, I'm penny pinching
Fuck focus, I'm perfect twenty-twenty vision
From the first to the ninth inning, you gotta love the way I'm winning
Like NBA players love white women
Face facts, in rap, ain't nobody iller, face facts
Yup, your boy's back and I want my Killa tape back
You can trust it, one fact, gorilla made raps
Nothing to fuck it, with or without a RZA made track
I bring the ruckus, to those, snitchers die slow
Bitches, suck dick for dough, killas get low
Dealers cut bricks of blow, Method kicks flows
Picks my hoes, with the same hand that picks my nose
Tell me, who that nigga in the airport, son?
With a half of O.Z. inside his Air Force Ones, smell me
What's that shit you smoking, Tical


Yo, yo, I'm the dope man, come through ya block
Swinging coke money, keep a Desert tucked in my coat, man
For stick-up niggas, who be thinking I'm a joke, man
Come test ya boy and get that ass smoked, man
It's not a game when I told ya I cop like sixteens
And I'm constantly on the run, ducking from d's
Running behind, bushes and trees, I can't even sneeze
And they force me to semi up the rebel with ease
I found myself on my knees, praising for Allah's forgiveness
Cuz deep down I know I'm on that man shit-list
I move when the wind shift, catch me on your eastern perimeter
Politic deals with the Senator
Nine shot's enter ya, that'll be the end for ya
Close ranger, I don't need no muthafuckin' infere'
I'm Staten Island's emperor, I'm bout to add degrees to the temperature
And if you get shot, then it was meant for ya






Man he must of bumped his motherfucking head or something
Yo
Yo M.C.'s out there, you betta stand clear
It's Funk Doc M.E.TH on da world premiere
From New Jerz straight talk, america's best
Co' Island Staten Island is where I'm at
Y'all amateurs act like hoes affendin us
We're special eders go on tours on banana bus
D. O. same m.o., drive through bricks
Chicken shotty, that ass make me lie to my bitch
Word to god doc throw more lines then fishin rod
No stars, we're supergod non recouperb-alls (yo)
Buttons is pressed to remove the press
Press a bullshit, my index press a full clip (YO)
Set up cones when I'm firing chrom
I hittin ladies to old men in retirement homes
Dail 9-1-1 runnin gun in the street dungeon
Earth, moon and stars checkin out what the sun done
Suspects change clothes
Before I leave the heat, I put two in rain grove for my range rove
Hot to death, cops is vex
I push a buck 60 if they try to block the lex
Drive by on the baja
Snatch the cartier watch I
Boucnce laughing off like clue "HAHA"
Doc is like poppy, supplying you gram
So breaka breaka while I turn it to the Shoalin Man


Foreva underground
Nigga duck the mic when we come around
Control hammer like the mighty Thor
Bringin thunda down
Now you're in store for predator
Like refugees I come to settle score
Half-baked metaphor, that taste even better raw
Hardcore holy war
Hits from the resevoir, southpaw saboteur
Land sharks get they chin checked when I jabba jaw
Time to walk my labrodor
Livin out my dreams, at the same time shatter yours
Code red fill 'em full of lead
Greatful Dead live from Hempstead
Tiger Kung Fu know the ledge
Check the full fledged knucklehead
Clam bread, livin on the edge used to be the best
Jack Frost sniffin at your nose, get your Sudafed
Rap Cheech and Chong, me and Red official budda head
Off track like O.T.B., I'm too black
I'm like Zoro, I mark a Wu, sign your back, motherfucka

Chorus:
(It ain't even a question) This side niggas too hardcore
(It ain't even a question) That side niggas too hardcore
(It ain't even a question) In the middle niggas too hardcore
So what cha, what cha, what cha, want (What cha want?)

(It ain't even a question) Def Squad niggas too hardcore
(It ain't even a question) Wu Tang niggas too hardcore
(It ain't even a question) Def Jam nigga too hardcore
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up) So what cha, what cha, what cha, want?


Yo stomp wit the big dogs
Sick dog lurkin (Roof Roof)
Doc bradshaw, behind ball plant and steel curtains
Denver Bronco fan, Glock squirtin
Brick city, stering wheel hurtin
Prepare y'all fast car for lane mergin
Hasta manana, y'all crash like Diana cock block into gramma
Got cock in Atlanta, rockin P.P.P. Bandanas
While we fuck 'em on camera
It's too late to plant bate for my click to fall
We dodge boobie-traps and pitfalls and thick fog
When I tee, LA ride, "It's y'alls"
Website couldnn't find a site wit macintosh
On John Walsh
America's Most, aim for spots to put more in a terrier coat


Uh huh, we speak for the unheard
Caught in the matrix
Sound from the subbasement, "Spread the word"
Like uncureables from dirty bird, beyond basic
John Woo these fake niggas, give 'em replacements
The thrilla of park hilla
Bubonic plague any M.C., that swear he illa
Inject the dufus wit the lupus
Yukmouth rhymes that leave him toothless
My filled fly and filled groupless
Observe the record, livin out my name, rep it
Study man and all his methods
And through his ethic, learn to expect the unexpected
One step ahead I, return like Jedi
Three hours behind your punk ass, catchin a red eye
First class but cooler than coach, murder he wrote
On the wall of the bathroom stalls shittin these quotes
"Fuck you all"
Scaredy cat kid, duckin these dogs
You don't like us, then we don't like y'all. Lick The Balls!
Be easy, speak easy
This one be off the heazzzaaaayyy
Like my pubic hair, black and greazzzzzaaayyyy

Who mind weaker, the house or the house speaker
And where would Nas and Jay-Z be without ether?
Which one you think want that repeat, i doubt either
How many people still wann see it
Tical neither
I might get blood on the wife beater but i dont need to
Beat up a diva then call the brother a child beater
My brothers keeper but stunt and ill be my brothers reaper
I call tha heater mosquito, your baby mama Zika
Follow the leader plus ima breathe the respect on it
This called classic so ima need ya'll to step on it
You see your song ain't really on til Meth on it
My next opponent gon have a 'Protect Ya Neck' moment
Core, hey man this track is cold as below zero
Ay dios mio tell mi amigo si hace frio
But i ain't bilingual, just understand that Method Man
Is more of an anagram like Live Evil




I don't want the horns, blowing..
I don't want the strings to play a melody...
(yeah, it's hip hop, it's hip hop
The mic needs to be a little bit more crystal)
I don't want to hear the good time is coming..
Don't want to hear the voices in back of me...
(youknowhatI'msaying? Cuz I'm bout to go in)
I'm not gonna hear it! I don't want the drummer..


Awwwww, Meth Tical, yo, you stepped on my corns and shit
Got the charm lit, bomb wrist, what type of arm is this?
I seen you at the Grammy's with a triple Bar Mitz'
Can I kick it? (Hell No!)
That's why she got hair in her elbows and she real slow
And uh, every two weeks she gotta see her P.O
She's a disgrace to signs, she fuck it up for Leos
Method Man (Toney Starks) the most important M.C. in the whole wide world
Is you and you hardly even know it, know it, know it..


Watch me shock the world, move the masses like a landslide
It's a lyrical stickup, everybody's (hands high)
See the bigger, picture, I'm out for the grand prize
I'm not a role player, seor, I'm the franchise


Aiyo, with Trife sweatin', every bullet is life threatenin'
And you could get a chest full of slugs in a slight second
Yo, my nine milli' pistol's really official
So you can Analyze That like DeNiro and Billy Crystal


Aiyo, it's Ghost with the sky blue kufi, smashin' groupies
Leavin' them fiend out, like New Jack's Pookie
Every line is like ninety nine dimes
Shrine Auditorium rap, aquarium's in my wall in the back


Now that you know my name, niggas know my game
If you feel me, then you know my pain
I seen you rap dudes done stole my slang, try'nna hold my fame
Ain't even strong enough to hold my thang
Wanna flow, fuck with me though, baby, I'mma try'nna see dough
My squad got them caught in the yard screamin' for C.O
Every time we blow, it raise the prize on the padrico
Ya'll niggas shoot your guns like Shaq shootin' a free throw


Spark the fluid, hop out and park the Buick
I got fiends blowin' C.R.E.A.M. like Martha Stewart
We on that up north jail shit, harder than steel chips
Ya'll niggas better bail quick, before you inhale clips


Ya'll better get low, before I let the Tec blow
Streetlife, I'mma try'nna get more dollars than Creflo
The whole hood echoes, every time my nine let go
Get out of line or steal your life like a klepto


When Biggie died, they came out with Biggie fries
Big biscuits got me over, in the streets wide
Prada gloves, layin' for thugs, prayin'
Drop a bronco buster, G-37 on the rap patient


I'mma be the shit this summer in that H2 Hummer now
Mami gotta Goya bean ass ay caramba, now
Eh boy el loco, oh no, I ain't Yoko
My hoes, I keep 'em lookin' good, right, but no dough

Put this shit back in order, do it like the crack days
Stack up, you little niggas back up, your raps suck
I demolish a maggot, faggot lines, nigga, you'se a savage
But don't never compare me to your wack times
I'll smash your hood up, yeah, anybody you call
I straight mash out, for cash nigga, put up
The Embassy's calling, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

In the city, raise that rent up, y'all niggas gonna give me, baby
Yeah, what, fucker, we stomp niggas out like XUV's
Then fuck ya girl in the but-ut
Nine rap playboys, see me in the Playboy Mansion
With the playboys on, I play rid-ough

Disrespect fam, yo ass gon' get smoked
We got real money, seven figure deal money
I'm in the Samuel Jackson, Time to Kill money


Yeah, we got them anthems, we handsome and raw
All day, cops harass, but we laugh at the law
And a fiend got my stash, I blast through your door
I caught her with the four, his dame was frozen
She loves sniffing coke til her veins is bulging
You punk motherfucker, your ribs is frail
I've been eating calamari, getting big in jail


Nigga, we glide when we ride, don't choke when we smoke


I got that sidedish super today, eye candy
With the sweetest love, one bite, your tooth'll decay
I'm moving units like I'm moving the yae, and like they say
In this business, you either in it, bitch, or you in the way
Sky's the limit, I ain't come here to play, or come to shit where I lay
Who in that six blunt, clipping his tray
Sippin' some Ice Water, dipping with Rae
Tipping these tricks, dripping for pay
And knowing half them bitches is gay
T.M.I. blowing tree in sky, we on the job
So be abvised, that wack niggas, needing apply
S.I., represent til we die, this track is pitching to fry
Enter the Dragon, I be spitting that fire
Keep ya balls off, so calling you dogs off
Cuz word to these jeans, hanging off of my ass, I never fall off
The sensei, with this pen I slay
Pick up a queen in Miami, then get M.I.A., John Blaze, bitch





* Dhani Harrison & John Frusciante play guitars


Shh, shh, shh, shh, Wu, Wu, Tang, Tang


The joy the flowers bring me
The pain still has me sinking
All while my heart gently weeps
Your smile has got me shrinking
The tears in your eyes are twinkling
Because the heart gently weeps


Snowy night, fiends basin', A Raisin in the Sun was amazing
The joint on the dresser, a gauge went off
Jumped up, fish tank, it fell, and they stuck
They shot her cousin LaVon, he owed a buck
Willie was awful, pulled out the ratchet, let off two
Grits fell on his leg, Kiana ripped the cold bowl
He violent, an Island nigga with the talent
Of six killas who just came home, from straight whylin
Robbin everything in Macy's, Lacy, short haircut
With long arms who fuck niggas, got four babies
Yvette jabbed her, slapped her wig off, ran in the crib
She did the dumb shit, my nigga then clapped her
Lester, smoked Chester sister Vest, I heard it was a mess
They ripped the apple out her throat, blessed her
Hungry hyenas from Medina, all "A-trainers"
Who got reluct', think fast and blast from Beamers


Yeah, yo
I brought my bitch out to Pathmark, she's pushin the cart
Headed to aisle four, damn I got milk on my Clark's
That's what I get, not focusin from hittin that bark
My mouth dried, need plenty water quick, I feel like a shark
In the aisle bustin them paper towels and wipin my Wally's down
I stood up to face a barrel, he's holdin a shiny pound
It's him, he want revenge, I murdered his Uncle Tim
I sold him a bag of dope, his wife came and copped again
{*singing*} That bitch is crazyyyyy
And uh, she brought her babyyyyy
She knew I had the murderous smack
It killed her man though
Now I got his fuckin' nephew grippin' his gat
You's a bitch - {*singing*} you better kill meeeee
You know you're bootyyyyyy
You pulled your toolie, out on meeeee... motherfucker
First thought was to snatch the ratchet
Said fuck it and fuckin grabbed it
I ducked, he bucked twice, this nigga was fuckin laughin
I wrestled him to the ground, tustle, scuffle, constantly kicked him
He wouldn't let go the joint, so I fuckin bit him
Shots was whizzin, hittin Clorox bottles
Customers screamin, then the faggot ran out of hollows
I had to show him what it's all about
Next thing you read in the paper, "A man who came to kill gets knocked out"


I don't know whyyy-hy-hyyyy, nobody told you
Man's not supposed to cry...
Though we're just babies, and it's so crazy
How tears of joy bring so much life


Yo, ayo, yo, yo
You on your way to the store nigga grab me a Dutch
I'm mad as fuck, my dude
My count was short when I was baggin it up
Now I need liquor, nigga pass me a cup
What's up with Officer Brown?
The other day he tried to shackle me up
He killed Kase and now he hasslin us
This motherfucker got balls
Even the gall to try and pattin me up
Time to re-up, let these niggas know we back on the block
With three hundred off a G-pack, crack in the spot


I don't know whyyy-hy-hyyyy, nobody told you
Man's not supposed to cry...
Though we're just babies, and it's so crazy
How tears of joy bring so much life


The joy the flowers bring me
The pain still has me sinking
All while my heart gently weeps
Your smile has got me shrinking
The tears in your eyes are twinkling
Because the heart gently weeps






I'll give you three seconds to come out wit' your hands up, one, two
This is my own private domicile
I will not be harassed, motherfucker!


Welcome to the meth lab, listen, it's time to cook
Not confessions of a video vixen, we by the book
Start the fire, I can tell what you thinkin' just by a look
I'm a crook, like some fish in a barrel, I got 'em hooked
Blame the Method, your sanity took, go 'head, admit it
You a meth head that live on the edge, just need a push
I'm your pusher, supplier, I'm back, the cheese on the wire
If a snitch burnin', wouldn't even piss on the fire
Now you kids learnin', I ain't tryin' to preach to the choir
Now the kids earnin' like them dealers that he admire
Got that whip workin' like I'm sacrificin' a virgin
That's a burden, but I'm certain you're feelin' it, after you try
You can't deny I cook a batch like, 'Woo'
Hazardous material, you'd need a hazmat suit
Now you lookin' at me like, 'What's a hazmat suit?'
Somethin' used to move a body, you don't have that loop


Let's talk about trust
I told you not to cook my recipe
And you went ahead and did it anyway
Cause I never said I wouldn't cook it
Cause it ain't yours, it's ours, bitch


Hookers in the kitchen, chemistry is the best recipe
Especially this shit, I'm takin' on bets
Pressure cookers, percolate 'em like chefs
Meth labs here to the West, wools on them gear trims grassed
Mr. Barker, General, front and center (What up?)
Got them burners wit' them bodies on them, have me in cuffs
Killer's focused, slam it up in them trucks
Eyes low, grippin' the toast, trigger finger, playin' it close
You think it's a game? It's imperative, we show 'em we live
These niggas playin' wit' this money, funny how niggas die
They say it's over when the fat kid cry, ratchets fly here to the Chi'


You think you can stop me from cookin'?
You cook whatever you like, as long it's that B work
These niggas be runnin' around in the street wit' everyday
Don't even think about usin' my grade A
You should try and stop me, bitch


I'm in the meth lab concoctin' another concoction
Decisions, decisions, just weighin' my options
The formula highly addictive, it's habit forming
Side effects life-threatenin', the surgeon's warnin'
I write a prescription just for meth abusers
Regulate your dose intake for heavy users
For generations, I been servin' these rap fiends
Babies born addicted to the metric, know what I mean?
You're recoverin', but you still use frequently
So wet your court hearin', judge show some leniency
Can't escape old habits, so you copy the new shit
Wit' your kids in your cars, see, pumpin' that Wu shit
We worldwide, supply and demand, I got the upper-hand
Check my passport, global support
Informant lands non-commercial goods, that raw and uncut
That got them breakin' bad at the gate for the re-up


What up, Street?
Yo, what up, man?
We gon' put some "Welcome to the meth lab" on there
Man, you know, it's straight gutter shit, nigga
Yeah, you ready to get 'em this time?
Yeah, always, man
Alright, so I'm a leave it up to you
Go 'head, show 'em what you got




My niggas, how we do it? You know it like a poet, baby doll
Break through it, you know it like a poet, baby doll
I spit, chew it, you know it like a poet, baby doll
Get in the music, you know it like a poet, baby doll


If you don't know, you better, ask somebody who I be
On land, air, or sea, I don't need No I.D
Once again, let's get under their skins like I.V.'s
Or Roman numerals fours (IV's) who we doin' the score
I got a shoe in the door, nothin' new anymore
Ya'll got love for me? I got love for you and yours
Tical Part 0, my friend, rappers is fightin'
Like Tyson, when nothin' else work y'all start bitin'
My shit, and his shit, I'm hopin' it end
I live my life like a lotto ticket, hopin' it win
Purple haze got me chokin' again, open again
I'm what's crackin', like your mamma smokin' again


If you see a model, then you might see me follow
Rubbin' her thighs like Aladdin rub the Genie bottle
Back for another swallow, Method, you know my motto:
"Ya'll might just win today, but I'll be back tomorrow"


Ya'll tryin' to get me started
Who on the short yellow bus tryin' to get retarded?
Kid don't be the artist, formerly known as artist
Jump off a skyscraper, the roof who hit the hardest
Where the bastards at and where they habitats?
I send they asses back to foldin' sweaters at the Gap
I like Nikes, food spicy, I'm a Pisces
That's why women love me and any nigga that's like me
Thoroughbread, I'm with gettin' this dough instead
Need a ho, like I need another hole in the head
Lord help me, I'm crackin' the safe, pocket like 'Face
Mighty Healthy, you know I'm the shit, soon as you smelt me




For what it's worth, the early bird sit at the table and eat first
My niggas need work, mami buggin', rippin' my t-shirt
We can kick it until our feet hurt
Mothers warn your daughters 'bout this tall drink of water
Spoiler, waiter give her anything she order on the menu
Method Man, live at your venue
Smokin' it, jumpin' off the dick, like he mental
Kid, I got a murder rap, and my head is simple
Open up the pussy, put the lead in the pencils
And people sayin' Wu gon' break up, ya'll
We got y'all numbers, it's time ya'll got your wake up calls, and..






Night gathers, and now my watch begins
It shall not end until my death
I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory
I shall live and die at my post
I am the sword in the darkness
I am the watcher on the walls
I am the shield that guards the realms of men
I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch
For this night and all the nights to come


Night gathers, my watch begins
To manifest 'til death, and it shall not end
I take no wife, no land, father no children
I wear no crown, win no glory and I shall not bend
I am the shield  that's here to guard the realms of men
I been in hell, while they're asking where the hell I've been
I am the sword in the darkness, the watcher of all
That means I'm heartless, bigger they come harder they fall
I pledge my life and my honor to the Night's watch
For this night and nights to come I give my life, watch
See the black crow, watch it revolve
Some call us black brothers
Ice watch, colder than yours, we wear them black colors


Are you even man enough to take the oath
Man enough to take a dagger to a throat
Or are you only man enough when it matters the most?
Whats the matter?
You was thinking your life mattered? It don't


Do you know what leadership means?
It means that the person in charge gets second guessed by every little twat with a mouth
But if he starts second guessing himself, that's the end


I am the sword in the darkness, the watcher of all
That means I'm heartless, bigger they come harder they fall
(Night Watch)(x2)




This is not the end, not for us
Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back




Yeah yeah, oh yeah
Yeah yeah, oh yeah
Yeah yeah, fuck yeah

Fell face first in the game and got me my first scar
First to ride like a friend on his first nod
First to get fired, the first day on his first job
But first things first, you're messing with the worst baby
Give me the presidental suite and the first lady

Be the first to front, you be the first to get jumped like a bone thug
Check me like every first of the month
I box'em in like just to be the first to punch
Second thought lock'em in like somebody in the trunk
First amendment is the freedom of speech
Too many rappers sell the freedom for cheap
The first taste, homey, on cloud nine
I ain't feeling my feet, I play to win
I ain't feeling defeat, I'm first place homey


This is the one
The race is on
Before the taste is gone

(Method Man)
I'm out...

Once again, it's the super, pied piper
Light your lighters for the future
And I ain't talking about Mekhi Phifer
Roll it if you got it people
At last the Prequel
And the eye ball
Floral is back
You'll find no equals
Bang it in your loudest system
Now who gunna diss him
Usually it be the brokest niggas
But this gunna fix em
Let me get my tool belt
For rappers that can use help
Now that Meth is back, you can tell me how my shoes felt
Just like Shaq in them size 22's
Except my games not a game
And I don't play by any rules man
Its time to build without a hardhat and goggles
Even with a map I'm still a hard act to follow
I thought you knew we do this everyday ok and I
Think marijuana is just nature's way of saying "hi"
Only hydro buds, I get it crunk
It's alright, if that bitch don't smoke then get her drunk
Now I pop a lot of shit, cause I can back it up (what)
I got that fire, bitch, its hard to pass it up (what)
While you'll was partying I been in the lab
You want that dope, give me an hour
Plus a pen and a pad

(Streetlife)
Aiiyo Meth what they look like (look like)
3rd LP nigga better be tight (be tight)
Don't forget where you come from, the hood life (hood life)
Let them know from the door we ain't the shook type (shook type)

(Method Man)
I got that shit that keep your head bobbin
Cause your neck know
Meth yo, I'm trying to get that more dollars then crep flow for certain
Before I put the pain, I put the work in
And each person I catch slipping gunna need nursing
Got these wanna-be gangstas, sleeping with they lights on
Shook up by the python, everybody got they eyes on
Not only is the streets watching, the streets is talking
And word has it that these rappers don't come around that often
Take it from the most slept on, you're wearing open-toe sandals
And I'm looking for some new toes to step on
And one to build a rep on, you all got me fucked up
My crew stick bitches like you, for acting stuck up
Methods like that yall, when I return you know the good herb is back y'all
Ladies and germs
Without further adieu
Let's keep it wu, and fuck keeping it real y'all
Just keep it juiced




Peace God (Peace to the gods)
How you God? (Studying 120 right now
Call me back at the God Hour)
The Fuck? It's just the new way of thinking
Light up the broccoli kid
Throw the relish in my back pocket
Keep your eyes open, push your seat back, just flow
That's how we doing it


Bound by honest sword take over the set, rap from here to Quebec
Throw up the TEC, crash your intellect, select a vet
Swimsuit mammal handle, yo every fly vandal go to project
Slam you like Hamill's Whitewater Scandal
Wally sandal just a sample, my niggas fertilize thoughts
Yo mad support drink a quart then bamboo
One nasty can blew, my pen sterile won't perform if I'm not lampable
Asking my man'll get you slapped down, play the anthem
Lit it who with it champagne get it, that's the ticket
Solid nines sounding like crickets snatching worker shipment
Pull her hair, long dick it, we talk right before we left lifted
Just like a long sleeve, guess who ripped it?


Projects (My niggas survive, just like a movin' target)
Projects (Where niggas live and some sell garbage that's)
Projects (Try to escape the flying shells, dodging)
New York projects (I'm living large yo, stop miraging)


Sign of the times, conspiracy to overthrow the mind
Behind every fortune there's a crime
This technique is TEC-9
Blast at any close encounter of the third kind
This be the evil that man do, we dismantle any adversary
Them niggas all thumbs and can't handle my flurry
Hear me, you jam on, you want to scare me
Don't even kid me, shit in my coat aiming at your kidney
Pressure, red hot like chilli pepper
Black 'n Decker hardware avoid the leper
Five o'clock shadowboxer, hold down the sector
Bet your bottom dollar lecture be hard to swallow
007 mark the secret agent
That macks well and gets smart through entertainment
Welcome to the killing fields with Johnny Dangerous
Headbanger boogie niggas going through changes


Projects (My niggas survive, just like a movin target)
Projects (Where niggas live and some sell garbage that's)
Projects (Try to escape the flying shells, dodging)
New York projects (I'm living large yo, stop miraging)


Suck my dick, it's the kid with the fat knob
I bust all into your face, plus it come in globs
Quick get on your knees, with your sweet pussy, let it breathe
Two fingers is all in your hole, think I can fit three
Your pink lips, spreaded and shit, let me throw my dick in
Grab my shit and place it gently on your clit
Ping-pong pussy, wide world the womb
Titties sagging, stomach on some shriveled up prune shit
Too much air in your pussy, you screaming that it's talking you daddy
Fart's breathing out your lips, splashing my dick badly
Use vinegar to try to tighten up your ginger
Almighty dick ran in with a cape, some call him engine
Lightning rod bob, black candy cane attached to God
Thick like a Great Adventure cigar, in your garage
Pregnant pussy have you fall out, like Remy on the house
Watch the teeth for sobbing my shit, you bit it on the couch
Dry pussy leave the friction burns, plus beef I hone
The condom broke, bitch you got AIDS I'm shaking in my bones




Hey, lace your boots up, tracks get looped up
The chocolate deluxe gets scooped up
All my pigeons is cooped up, Wus up, Ws up
If you aint with us, chuck a duce up, and let us do us
Break a promise but not my group up
Veterans is dying and used up
Lets see if they can hang, Im already tying the noose up
Im too hot, if you not, get you stuffed
Get you touched and get you shot or you cut
Young buck Im just trying to toughen you up
Cant let you hustle with us, ya aint struggled enough
Yall been cuddled too much, maybe mothered too much
So the burner giving out loans here is a couple of bucks
Had a couple of scuffs, I aint saying Im perfect
I aint cursing on the rhyme but I wrote it in cursive
Quote the verses, boy I flow with a purpose
Get that proMeth and a soda, come with the purchase


Who is that up in the building?
Hashtag we still win
Raekwon no relation to Chef tho, but still trend
My youngun tell em its them
Wu-Tang is for the children
They bugging, tell em again
Wu-Tang is for the children


Lab with the pole, slide down, Im in the basement counting faces
Drunk on the slouch, count the spaceships
Jewelry to my knee caps, breathe stacks whores & sleestaks
HSBC see me getting g-packs, herringbones mad stones in em
The voice is olive green, three doors Im on bring my goons home
Pumas on, points like unicorns, fuming in uniforms
What you wanna do with me, just sue me homes
Yea Half Mike half Nike, handle got grip
Got monkeys out here ready to flip
We pull a stunt, grab knots, push cops, just for vengeance
For killing that real shit independence
Far glowing like blonde hair, probably be the way we be rolling
Lets cash a check yall bring the broads here
Until the sun burns out, aint nobody eating
We on your block now, Glock up or call the precinct

(Chorus  Method Man & Raekwon)
Who is that up in the building?
Hashtag we still win
Raekwon no relation to chef tho, but still trend
My youngun tell em its them
Wu-Tang is for the children
They bugging, tell em again
Wu-Tang is for the children


Deck performing on the track, call him Jeff Gordon
Im still buzzing this is Hennessey the next morning
The upset talking, Im yes y'allin for cheques
Bossin the set, you acting like my ex calling
Aint that a bitch, not the 5 or the 6
I rock 7 on my back thats Kaepernick
I dazzle like a magic trick, fabulous swordsmen
Sort of like abortion I aint having it
S I ready for action, heavily cashing
We set for whatever, whats happening
Cold like the weather in Aspen, flow everlasting
4, 5, 6, your head is crackin, just a fifth of E&J and a eighth of green
No promethazine but I make them lean
Im running with the real yall chasing dreams
While the crowd go wild for their favorite team

(Chorus x 2  Method Man & Raekwon)
Who is that up in the building?
Hashtag we still win
Raekwon no relation to chef tho, but still trend
My youngun tell em its them
Wu-Tang is for the children
They bugging, tell em again
Wu-Tang is for the children




Yo, I gotta be around this music, it's therapeutic
The first fresh thoughts of the day is so clear
When I walk, in my head, there's a voice that talks
In my ear I can hear so clear, you think I'm buggin' right?
I'm just contemplating the silent 
Out to the West Side my killer Cali gangstas
Ride and get the head right
Yo son, I'm on the next flight in
Twist some  I'm guaranteed the right of his psalm before we reach
Throw the instrumental on it, watch  pattern of speech
Man-formed military arm ready to swarm, get your party on
Drinks on the house tonight, ladies lookin' right
Atmosphere nice and warm, we backstage like a hundred thieves strong
Ghost want the red light on before we get on
An hour's too short to rock, we got a million songs


Yo I gotta be around this music, it's therapeutic
Like my first blunt of the day to start the movement
I'm sittin' in the room with a view, there's always room for improvement
So I grab my coat and go and prove it
Just me against the world, you can find me in the streets
She'll spot me in the lobby, probably find me in the free
Cop a 'Rari, the  in the lining of my seats
Tryna put me in a lineup til' I wind up in the beast
That's the belly, how dare they tryna tell me when to eat
With a plate of food barely in my reach
My team shoot dice, we used to shoot skelly in the streets
Wear the same Pelle-Pelle's for a week
But now we livin' life
A such a good life I wish that I could live it twice
I'd probably make the same wiz my wife
It's Wu-Tang Clan, always collect cheddar
Proper education, always correct errors


Yo, bananas, Redman so gorilla
Chi-town know I'm pimping the mic, nigga
One hit, and chicks follow me like Twitter
Crack when I talk, I like the mic steam up
The fiends hit it, chicks swing with it
I'll box niggas in like Don King did it
Sixteens I write, it's seems so vivid
My notebooks I let the eBay did it
I get dough, bad pair for the sick flow
My weed more greener than Lou Ferrigno
My right-hand man hand on the pistol
I crack these squares up like Nabisco
Oh, look at me, I'm lightweight
But with the heart to peel back your white meat
Yo wifey want me to make her wifey
Hit it, make the bitch hyphy at high speed, Doc



Intro:

Dead crosswords puzzling your delf
See that's what I'm talkin bout
When you take the Johnny Blaze
And you take that game and you plug that here into Bobby Steels
Now, you are playing with power
With power
With power


I got your mind twisted
Unrealistic wavelength draining on your brain-strip inflicted
Crossword puzzling your delf
Questioning your own mental health, yeah, it's like a maze within itself
Yeah, Check the grimey, slimey, crimey
Crim-inim-inal indivi-dual I be
Searching for the Dark Knight
Lurking in the shadows of the city, he roll with jiggy
My crime committee, robbing every Gotham piggy bank blind
Take a journey through the mind of a Riddler



Tax free money not a problem
A heist to get the ice not a problem
A body for a price not a problem
It's The Riddler



Once again it's the mind bender, three-time felony offender
Demented, brain cemented, mixed in the blender
I lose ya, mass-confusion, question mark clues in
What where why whose-it, quiz
Time to ask yourself who it is
Sheisty P.L.O. underhanded biz, invading brothers wigs
Can I live corrupt and bringing all the misery and suffering
Pain, you couldn't cure with a Bufferin
Rotating, ridiculous, rapid-fire riddles
Bat get trapped in the middle of The Riddler



Murder for the evil not a problem
To the gen there is no sequel not a problem
Big up to all my people not a problem
It's the Riddler



Observe if you will
I'm in my hide-out in the back of the hill
I crack a wall then I caught about a mil
Co-defendant Johnny Blaze and Bobby Steels
We was blazing hot wheels
Turn the corner you can hear the wheels squeal
On that ass fast was the Batmobile
I could tell by the demon on the grill, this was real
Alley-cat screaming, I hit a trash can
Garbage everywhere, money flying out the bags and
Trying to escape, code nine with the cape
Or else he'd be headed upstate, it's The Riddler



Talking suicide, not a problem
If you're speaking homicide, not a problem
You want to talk genocide not a problem
That's not a problem, for The Riddler


Word up, that's no problem
Stim-ulim-uli, stim-ulim-uli
Feel good don't it
And you know it
Got the, hotter
You're playing... with... power




Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?


I smell it


Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?


I smell it

Come on, come on


Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?


Yo, finally The Rock has come back
Layin down the smack on your monkey crap candy coated ass
Enter the squared circle with the Great One
Most electrifying moves, don't change the station
Children and their children, they all chant
With the millions upon millions of Rock's fans
Get ready for the square dance, here's your chance
For a can of ass whooping, from the People's Champ

If you smell what The Rock's cooking

Jabroni, go back to the gym, you're too bony
So you want a piece of The Rock? Make you crumble
In these Wrestlemanias, kid, we Royal Rumble
Telling us that Raw is War, what the hell you think we came for?
Just to play with these whips and chainsaws? And sharp glass
I'll shine them up real nice, turn them sideways
And shove them up your candy ass

If you smell what The Rock's cooking

Now you got a problem, with the Brahma Bull
Time to throw Rock Bottom
Ain't no way to stop him
See the People's Elbow, ignite the crowd
Into a feeding frenzy, they want blood now
Chinlock and chair shots, suplexes, legdrops
Finish with the People's Elbow and sign it Rock

If you smell what The Rock's cooking

Yeah, uh, check it out, yea


We shall remain winners, for the haters, the pain lingers
Don't play with us, we head huntin', your game switches
The sour, the sweet, devour your fleet, we sinners
By all means, victorious, the world witness
I'm more vicious, for ya'll seven course delicious
Silver spoons, we pillage crews, cause convictors
The most wanted, my soul haunted, roads to riches
Leave you broke on it, we spoke on it, cold as winters
So hibernatin', sweet dreams, we violent apes
With higher stakes, nightmare niggas that rhyme on tapes
Inject the drugs, we messengers, from violent days
Soon to come, just move from us, find your way
In a world of hurt, backstabbers and murderers
Niggas roll the bud, and burn a Dutch, I turn it up
Just another notch, we smother spots across the globes
On Fordham Roads in Metropolis, Boston foes


These men don't cry (why) we just get even (even)
Stop them from eatin', kill 'em all softly
Of course we be (creepin') of course we be (reachin')
Feel the force when we (reachin')




Who, me? M-E-T, H, the O, the D, can't be done
Like try'nna find a penny in the sea
Nigga run, for cover son, go and get them guns
Ya'll ain't from here, don't try to come around here gettin' one
You get done here, just for askin'
Stick the key in the lock to Pandora's Box
Lungs collapsin', gaspin' for breaths
Lord Have Mercy, it hurts me, to know
Thirst is everything and I'm still thirsty
Ask myself, who the boss label try'nna work me
Next time, don't forget my dick when you jerk me
Try'nna stop my conquest, I'm like a one legged man
In an ass kicking contest, hah
Walk a mile in my shoe, whoop an ass or two
Cop a nasty attitude, still I ain't mad at you
Hurry up and take your time, buck-ed naked nine
Take your shores high, and make it mines, word
Until we even, or one of us is barely breathin'
Shaolin, we in the house, and we ain't leavin'
The Loooooooooooooord Have Mercy, muthafucka








Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (hah)
Johnny Blaze (hah!) Al Simmons (hah!)
Wu-Tang (hah!) *Flipmode* (what?)
Word is bond, Shaolin, Brooklyn
What it look like, what it be like
What it sound like, what it feel like, muthafucka (you know?)
All day, Brooklyn to Staten Island, connected
Put it all together, it's basic) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!




Yes I'm in the place for sure!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
'Til crime pays up
John Blaze up
I'm hella hot
Get that weight up
This nigga straight up
Like twelve o' clock
 up
I mixed it with 
To blow the cake up
Bet on Jacob
Might wake up
Gagged and taped up
It's us
Older than dirt
We fart dust
Plus we can't get enough of this
In God we trust
That's big bucks
I drive a big-ass truck
That's just big enough for a big-ass butt
Errday, (everyday) follow my lead
And errday, (everyday) I keep weed
Like all that I need is Mary J
Want mo' pay
Gimme mo' chips than Frito-Lay
So any thoughts of sinking my ship is D.O.A
That's right family, understand me?
I boombayeh where you lay, family
Like Miami, be M.I.A
Now how high?
So high that I can kiss the sky
Who wanna (kiss) be the next ass that's kissed goodbye?
Speaking my piece, before ya fix ya lips to try
I'm hotter than greese
And I got bigger fish to fry
In this cold world, no tellin' who's supplying the heat
Who put niggas on Elm Street and hope they die in they sleep?
I got my sword on, not a average sendin' me in
What oxymorons, this is where your ending begin
That's just a method
If it ain't, I ain't saying it is
Some call me father like a priest, but I ain't playin' with kids
Pass the dutch, my blood pressure that's what's up
And that shit that y'all was writing all day...
That's my nuts
Stay focused, stay in ya lane
I swing a hook like Candyman
If ya sayin' my name
Ain't nuthin' change


Ya know why?
Cause that tough talk 'ill get ya nowhere fast
Champagne bottled if ya go there smash
Hits after midnight and still cash rule
I'm lovin' Cinderella and her one glass shoe
I'm is what I'm is and that's all that I'm is
I've been spoiled, my kids called it like it is
Watch out now, who buyed his milk as a cow?
And his fat farm come with a hoe and a plow
That leave you sleepy
Defeat me, how?
You greasy, yo' bitch got a eye on her knee
They call her "Kneesee"
Ten years and counting
It's been me and these two balls now
And we ain't thinking bout bouncing
The show ain't over 'til the fat lady sings
'Til then, I'll see more ass than a fat lady('s) jeans
Folks wanna picture me broke, watch the birdie
Then let's get dirty like Westwood and Jersey
Come on




"Wanna see the world, ain't scared to do it
Even if, your shocked by it
Me and you, lost when you do it
By myself, better off bein' you"


Smoke cess nigga, smokin' that A.K
Norther lights, yeah.. stick 'em!
Uh, ahhh, baby, you know it like a poet, baby doll
Yeah, yeah, crooked letter in, uh uh, S.I., better
Known as the crooked letter I
Come on! Self Service


Y'all know me since '93, now let that weed burn
Back in this bitch, class dismissed, it's the return
Of the super sperm, game over, lose a turn
Takes a germ to kill a germ, when will y'all killas learn
Your only as good as your last hit
Soon as you put them automatics on safety that's it
I calm them bastards, I call them ratchets
Till you blasted, till y'all come ashes to ashes
We make classic, huh, bring you a rougher sound
You either up or down, don't get that ass kicked
Ya'll niggas fuck around, y'all only tough around
The crowds, scared to bust a round, don't get that ass kicked
What part of the game is this?
I came to break bread, evidently y'all killas came to bitch, nigga
So, whose the whipped nigga, don't even trip, nigga
Some say they pull trigga, I think they bullshitter
I just begun to fight, if mommy like daddy talk
Then daddy might get him some tonight
Give me, my limelight, give me, my five mics
Give me, some weed and a light to get my mind right
Is he, the illest M.C., to ever play the tough city
To find out it'll cost you bout a buck fifty
Across your face swiftly, my after taste shitty
Whose built by New Yitty, whose milked like two titties
And I ain't even got to say my name
I got this duck wit her legs up like, "say my name, trick"
You think it's all a game, like pussy all the same
I'm speakin' toilet slang, not seakin' hall of fame
It's raw, sushi, stain in your drawers, dooky
Quarter a Lucy, quarter more for a groupie
That like to pop snoopy, think she gon' pop coochie
Just cuz you got Gucci, don't mean you not hoochie
Girl, I tell it like a T-I-N
Ain't no other kids eatin' till I feed my kids
Trick, oh, you ain't crushin', sister, I can't do nothin' wit you
My money's celebate, honey, and we ain't fuckin' wit you
I do it for the nookie, some say I'm too pushy
Only thing better than pussy, that's some new pussy
There that go, looky, it's gettin' ugly even
With niggas so broke, they couldn't spend a lovely even


Yeah, that's it
Yeah, Method Man has just left the muthafuckin' building




Come on! Yeah... yeah..
Yo, yo


Wu-Tang, we always in the Spot Lite
Get paper, every night is hot night
We stay tight, we just livin' our life
We just livin' our life


I drink till I'm drunk, smoke skunk with my stinkin ass, smell the funk
Eekin out the pours, cum stain, shitty drawers
Pissin' down ya elevators shaft, no class, writin graf' on ya walls
It be us, fuck ya law, nigga, my cause is "because"
No yin to my yang, it's a black thing
Used to be in chains, now we snatch chains
Took the crack game applied it to the rap game, y'all
Pop quiz, now, what artist hits the hardest?
Get down with the syndrome: retarded
I think it was them swordsmen, place ya chess pieces on the boards and
Take it to square, this ain't no Yacub affair
Or a New World Disorder, got us, fuckin the coal miner's daughter
That y'all, but not us
Fly back, flag a cab and say "check ya"
Next time you see me, say peace and I'll respect ya, Tical




Yo, lights, cameras, don't forget the action
The needle skip, but the turntable scratchin'
Chain blow, bangles, heavy on the cashin'
Same old, Range rove', rainbow Manhattan
Craftmen, captive, still I'm avalanchin'
Holy war, handsome, break 'em off harassin'
Latest fashion, passion, bullets reign gashin'
Flippin' through frenzy, the same Wu-Tang
The Hollywood frame, purple haze stain
Rules of dame, fools, choose to bang
Nigga, you lose, Wu, bruise the game
A few men came, that really held weight
Drop, Chinese bars, stars in fifty-two states
Like, bats out of hell, we crash the gates
Without a base, left the gun powder case
Ladies chase, the hip-hop Babyface




Word up, throw your hands in the air, like you just don't care
Wu-Tang in your atmosphere, everybody say "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"


Mic Capone, it's best to avoid my strike zone
I zone and swing a sword that'll slice stone
Nice clone, but you could never match the born master
Who tore back half the world, and still saught after by
Dick ridin' niggas, and chicks who do ditto
Singin' like the Four Tops, providin' info
See me low, through the Jeep window, the chrome spins slow
Gene-ral on the J.O., survival M.O
For now get wild, similar to Ol' Dirty
A third time felon just hit with over thirty
Note worthy style, have them so thirsty
First degree heat, you quittin' on me
Cold turkey, no mercy




Wu-Tang, put you in the Cobra Clutch, til you give up
Ya'll can live up to, Witty Unpredictable
Street mentality, return of the cavalry
36 Chambers, we off key block
Black on the block, tell ya D.J.'s to quit
M.C.'s, to stop that bullshit
Me, Ghost and Rae, we known to pull shit
Step with the brick, on some Ice Water shit
Wallo's in all colors (now) let's get chips, like
Robbin' the bank, pull up with the new whips
Don't get mad, respect rank
No matter how you gettin' dough, give thanks
Everybody hold up your shanks





"Everywhere I turn, I see, your face..."


Yeah, ah, yeah, yo, yo, yeah
Yeah, motivate, motivate, from the gate, ya'll
Yeah, aiyo, aiyo, aiyo


And we the Gods, still tear the whole hood apart
Darts that'll splatter through faces, taste niggas hearts
I'm intellectual, plus professional
And Walbaums to vegetables
Shit is right here, like buyin' fly gear
Dare any white man or fan nigga, ran through niggas
Blew shotties in niggas lobbies, the grand RZA
We left, the radio broke, I yoke my vocals, hittin' green smoke
Allah Math', show me when the needle broke
Numb the whole crowd up, stupid ass Loud fouled up
Never knew what they had, now they proud of us
Picture my vision, precision, lines jumpin' out of commission
Divine got me, nigga, the boss, he pop me
Rae, we gotta generate, lord, I feel the Ditech, the mildew
Buy jets and vehicles, steal a little
Wrap up the whole rap government


Go head, ya'll floss wit it
Walk wit, I slap your boss wit it
Navy blue, New York fitted, I'm cold frost bitted
Two puffs and off wit it
You smell the herb, 'fore I lit the spots its forfeit it
Blocks is hot, feel the shot from fourth/fifth it
With no regard for your boulevard, just the shit bag and bullet scar
It's the Riddler, riddle me this, riddle me that
Who the pretender? And who the door man that let them enter?
The Wu-Tang, 36 Cham', what you smokin'?
Got you in the game chokin', like Van Gundy coachin'
Your street team, bunch of weaklings
Don't ever let me catch your reachin'
Respect when a grown man is speakin'
Shh, keep on sleepin', and just like TLC, I keep on "creepin"
The five percent of ya'll, keep on teachin'
The heat seakin', missile official, that got issues
Like Funk Doc got snot tissue, it's Hott Nikkels

"Everywhere I turn, I see, your face, but you're never there"


Shh... shit ain't over..
Okay, now, same shit, different day, grindin', gettin' paid
Self at it, automatic, guns that spit and spray
Gotta have it, ass grab it, time to slip and weight
Godbody, House your Party, watch the Kid N Play
Ya'll gon' make me go postal, up in this muthafucka house
Full of bloodsuckers and hoes that love hustlers
Roll that izza, pour me another kizza
Bigga, to my nigga, so drunk they can't get up
Shotguns through nose, hot ones through foes
Let the herb spots run til the cops come, suppose
I was just another stick in the mud, on a Saturday
Thinkin', how I'mma get the fifth in the club
See my crew thick, everyday I fights to prove it
We comes undisputed, with batteries included
Honey's "bee" like Meth, I be like what?
They want some free cd's, I'm like "see these" nuts


If ya'll muthafuckas gettin' high tonight, say all right, haha
If ya'll muthafuckas gettin' drunk tonight, say all right, haha
It be Tical, ok, haha, yeah, yeah, ok
It be Tical, ok, haha, yeah..




I grew up around block parties ready to rock
Behind the rope nigga with my rhymes on cock
The verse shot first nigga who had shit to pop
A bad weather blow the feathers off a hundred flocks
With 70% goose, 30 ducked, get stuck
And each link in your chain is trucked
No ends in this rhyme cipher with nine snipers
Charge of the kiss from the Pied Piper
I live around DJ's, b-boys, MC's
Through rap never thinkin' +Airways+ are TVs
It was strictly all about magnificant rhyme clout
+Rec Room+, 2 dollars with the flyer as we would doubt
Now his wigs pushed back
Name scratched off the plaque, too wild to re-enact
(Yo)


Got to check out +The W+, got to check out-- +The W+
Got to check out +The W+, got to check out-- +The W+


MC's have the right to remain silent
Everything you say can and will be used against y'all muh'fuckers
And Mef can only trust ya as far as I can see ya
Me need ya? That'll be the.. day, ya busta
It gets no rougher when, me and my comrades rush ya
Like red heat with hammers and sickles
I milk like ya baby mama's nipples, got issues
It's just us, so what's what if any can touch us
Then lord strike me down where I stand at now
Wit this bottle of Remy, gettin' fucked up child, listen
The most notable MC, ya source for hip hop quotable MC
Of course it's Tical!




The Princess, the Pope, incest, dope
Choke you by the throat, the chrome handle smoke
The man not for joke, we all out for broke
Plus the herbal that I tote, the murder that I wrote
You can't do me none, my Uzi weighs a ton
I'm comin' from the slum, Wu is number one
I stumbled on the drum, the Gods are troublesome
+Rumble+ when we come, boy you better +Run+, +Run+




Aiyo, it's like this jumpin' out of golden whips
Flashin' mega bricks, outfits, rock ridiculous whips, bitch
Wavy hair, men of the year, bent in the stairs
Sick winter gear, been on position is where
Call him an Asiatic God-body, +Longevity+
Slang rap, you get your whip wrapped
Swing through the hood calmly
Yo what up? Staten Island, Bush, George
Dust your shit off, whips spin off
Get off, slips, which, wiz
Mind di-tects mines, lines lick sick nines
Pick wines, lift up, bill a nigga six flies
Dip wide, dress my shit up, fuck six times, wish mine
Rub lamps, take thousand dollar crystalines





I used to get feels on a bitch
Now I throw shields on the dick
To stop me from that HIV shit
And niggas know they soft like a Twinkie filling
Playing the villain, prepare for this rap killing
Biggie Smalls is the illest
Your style is played out, like Arnold wondered
"What you talking 'bout Willis?"
The thrill is gone, the black Frank White
Is here to excite and throw dick to dykes
Bitches, I like 'em brainless
Guns, I like 'em stainless steel
I want the fuckin' Fortune like the Wheel
I squeeze gats 'til my clips is empty
Don't tempt me
(T H O D Man)
You don't want to fuck with Biggie
Here I am, I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over hominy grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes, I'm a jet black ninja
Coming where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, you'se the number one contender
Looking cold booty like your pussy in December
Nigga stop bitching, button up ya lip and
From Method, all you getting is a can of ass whipping
Hey, I'll be kicking you son, you doing all the yapping
Acting as if it can't happen
You front and got me mad enough to touch something
Yo, I'm from Shaolin Island and ain't afraid to bust something
So what cha want, nigga? Ya punk, nigga
I got a six-shooter and a horse named Trigger
It's real, ninety-four, rugged raw
Kicking down your goddamn door
(And it goes a lil' something like this)
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get, ya gotta work hard for it
Honies, shake your hips, ya don't stop
And niggas pack the clips, keep on
Verse two, coming with that Olde E brew
Meth Tical, putting niggas back in I.C.U
I'm lifted, troop, you can bring yours wack ass crew
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue
No question, I be coming down and shit
Yo, I gets rugged as a motherfucking carpet get
And niggas love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm, I'm not a gentle, man
I'm a Method Man
Baby, accept it, utmost respect it
(Assume the position)
Stop, look and listen
I spit on your grave, then I grab my Charles Dickens
Welcome to my center
Honies feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the winter
Far from the inventor but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my Mac unloads
I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop duke left Mom duke
The fagot took the back way
So instead of making hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-up
Cause hoes is irritating like the hiccups
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the Praying Mantis
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfucking rap phenomenon
Plus
(I got more Glocks and techs than you)
I make it hot
(Nigga, won't even stand next to you)
Nigga, touch me, you better bust me
Three times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, ya thought so
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get, ya gotta work hard for it
Honies, shake your hips, ya don't stop
And niggas pack the clips, keep on

Back spins to windmills. Who's still the gin drinker?
Ill thinker explodin' when the paper hits the ink
Grab your gangster chronicles and turn to page 6-6-6-
The holocaust, BIG the merciless

Honeys feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the winter
Ricochet off the vertebrae then splat where your heart be at
Now starts the cardiac arrest Where's your vest?
You forgot now you slowly drop cuz your heart stopped
Beaten, your bitch-ass crew is retreatin
Niggas left you, fucked up passed out with your ass out
Pockets ran through stripped with your brains bashed out
Niggas wanna do me slugs just run through me
Like trees to branches
Cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfuckin' rap phenomenon, plus
(I got more Glocks and techs than you)
I make it hot (Nigga won't even stand next to you)
Nigga touch me you better bust me
Tree times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, ya thought so


Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it
(Honeys shake your hips), ya don't stop
(And niggas pack the clips), keep on
Motherfucker uh
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it

Whips are spotless, chrome rims spend obnoxious
You can't knock this, bust a shot you better not miss


X-1 wild out, and make you watch this

Unload a cartridge, and bust a cap
X could never trust a cat, Onyx is as hot as it gets
Bitches fuckin for free, is outta the quest'
Blow blood outta your flesh, your body outta your vest


I toss the heat from across the street
Fly you up off your feet, you die livin soft and sweet
Street crime, time is money, nigga don't waste mine
Expose my 9, throwin your shine, your froze in time

Straighten your waist, twist you, and won't miss you

Tryin to count more math, bring in the hardcore rap


Yo; we be the mainstream
Supreme rhyme top of the line cuisine fiends
Number one love for thugs queens schemin on cream
My whole team love, the E-cup bras and mobb cars
Killa Sin known for makin niggas reach for the stars
The terrorist lyricist in the midst of the abyss
We cannabis evangelists, iron palms with metal fists

 Holy shit!! Who the fuck is dat?

 Sticky Fingaz kid, you got my back?

Hot Nix' spit flame, lava pump through my veins
Caught in the zone, home on the range

 Eight ball in the corner pocket
 We snatch wallets off the white collared
The Big Apple forever rotted
Narcotics hunt the hard target, Hot Nix'
 SO WHAT THE BUMBACLOT?!


Pop shit, we do the knowledge
To shark niggas, once bitten
Major swingers heavy hittin
Poly your kitten, throw up your mittens
Stop bitchin, no slippin, no pot to piss in
The meltin pot's boilin hot now in Hell's Kitchen


Yo, yo, Sticky Fingaz, one of the illest motherfuckers
BELIEVE DAT!! My moms don't raise no suckers
I slap rappers, turn 'em into singers
Touch somethin of mine and you'll have NINE fingaz!

 Enough said, let's paint this whole fuckin town red
 And RIP .. they whole crew to a shred!

 Show no love

 Shoot yo' home up
 And shoot up the whole club
 We throw slugs


You ain't no thug!
I earned every God damn penny that I got
Son I'm rollin shotgun in the convertible
I wish a nigga W-W-W-WOULD
Try to fuckin jack me, I'll MURDER YOU!!!



Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang - ONYX!!
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang - ONYX!!




Damn, I hate it when it rain
Ever since I came in the game
Some hated on the fame
A lot of niggas done changed
And started actin' strange
Even labels turning they backs
And started backing lames
Radio is the same, whole lotta speculatin'
These mutherfuckas defacatin' on the name
Wu-Tang, if this is where the hip-hop is
Radio lyin' then, that ain't where hip-hop live
It lives in the streets, we eat to live they livin' to eat
I'm fed up, that nigga rides in 'em, givin 'em sleep
R.I.P., make me the king of all I see
And when death call I'm good I got call ID
See it was clan in the front, now they just gon' front
Like my joints is on proactive, and they just don't bump
Then niggas gon' say I lost my skill
When in fact they all been programmed
And lost they feel, fo' real


They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say


Like I'm givin you your last rites, when you see my face
All you're lookin at is stars and stripes
With three-fourths of the drug law
So now you know why we build with bricks, they build with straw
Against the mark of the beast
Cause sometimes men must fight wars to truly have peace
Hear to conquer valleys of foreign soil
'til you show me all your hidden weapons and fields of oil
I'm sendin in troops, heavy press want the inside scoop
I'm like mums the word up in this coop - oversee that God
When they move that quick
Admire my swag to use it as a measuring stick
I paid my dues, why we can't lose, plus I refuse
To let 'em stagnate the growth of my blues
The pattern of me is sign no statements, cop no plea
In what can only be American Me




Ask Miss Hill, half these critics ain't got half this skill
Often so hungry that they have to steal
If I didn't have my deal, and didn't have this mass appeal
Then I'm back up in that trap, swingin' crack it's real
And that ain't worth the time, so search and find a new nerve
And here's three words: stop working mine
It take a lot more to hurt my pride
Jerk my vibe more than media lies, cry when dirt dog die nigga
The last album wasn't feeling my style
This time my foot up in they ass but they feelin' me now
Cause Tical, he put his heart in every track he do
But somehow yall find someway to give a whack review
It ain't all good, they writin' that I'm Hollywood
Tryin' to tell you my shit ain't ghetto and they hardly hood
Come on man, until you dudes can write some rhymes
Keep that in mind when you find yourself reciting mines




I'm gonna take you down
Unless I take you down first
"Unless I take you down first"
Is that the best you can do?
Shut up, punk!



Yeah, baby, hey yeah, yeah
And you know, said you know
Said you know, said you know babe, yeah

So you say your ish is it
And you say your ish is hot
You want me to touch your spot
Cuz that's how we do it
Now I watch your earrings jingle
And I watch you work your middle
Cuz your handle bars ain't little
Makes me wanna (Y'all ain't ready)

1 - 	If you wanna dance
If you wanna move
If you wanna dance
Yeah show me what to do
I keep it movin', givin' it to you
Cuz this is what we do
This is what we do, yeah

Repeat 1

Said East Side, where you at, yo what the deally
And to my ladies over West can you feel me
Tell me what the deal with the South
And tell me Master P got it all figured out
But if you say you with me, show you with me
You're so pretty, you stay shitty
Ain't no shorty over 40 chillin' in the VIP with me
Damn right, game tight, cuz that's how we do it tonight

Repeat 1
Repeat 1


Yo, yo
Who got the best body on the planet
I take advantage, then skate like the kissin' bandit
Leave of hearts
Got these shorties out after dark
We're lady killers
Then blow back apart, raw dealers
Tical! Dru Hiller, strange love, seven thirty
I'm like Herbie with a Love Bug
Then skip town like a Casanova Brown Mrs
You look delicious like a two piece with a biscuit
What's goin' down?
In my mind I'm rippin' your clothes
Playing with your feet girl suckin your toes
Go round with the Ghetto Sarano', mello
Romeo, who like his women on the same level
Pay my bills that were due, all accounts settled
Now I'm relaxing like Pa now with Ma Kettle
Baby laughing, earrings in both nipples
Like Janet Jackson, busting out her latest fashion
Or the smashin'
Honey come on over here, I **** feet cold
Throw them panties over there, you won't need those
You talk like sex
You walk like sex
Ya smell like sex
Ya yell like sex
And all ya want is Mr. Meth, hell of a man
That can sell an Eskimo a fan
I come equipped for any spot that you want hit
Or want licked, when my dick get the fuck outta here, ahh, shit
I start to think back on how I go hump
In seven minutes to heaven at the age of eleven
Couldn't tell me nuthin' then, can't tell me nuthin' now
Honey child, milkin' the cow, lovin' my style
This is what we do kid, me and them Dru kids
Take 'em blind, crimpin' them crazy, even toothless
Lastly, if you know me don't ask me
Call me Method, Mr. Meth if ya nasty

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

If I move it on the left, will it be hot to death
If I move it on the right, will you make it last all night (Woody)
If I move it up and down, will you make a freaky sound, come on
If I move it in and out, will it make you scream and shout
Come on

Repeat 1 until fade




Do you see these bags under my fuckin' eyes!?
Geez! That's all I ever wanted was, uh huh, uh huh, yeah yeah, thing thing
That's all I ever really wanted was, thing thing


There I go, rushin' the dough, puffin' the 'dro
I get low, with nothin' to show, like cuttin' the blow
Y'all niggas know, the Clan in effect, the man on your left
Is M-E-F, I'm cashin' a check to snappin' a neck
My M.O., is stabbin' the third, Staten, you heard!
With P.O., pluckin' your nerves, who fuckin' you bird?
When you ain't, stickin' the stink, I'm thinkin' I'll thank my critics
Booger they drinks and sugar they tanks, who is it?
Back in this bent, with rappin' and shit, it's Bobby
Attached to his hip, like ratchet to clip, it's Johnny
From tappin' my herb, to tappin' your chin, for dough
Don't shorten my word, or shorten them ends, for sure (yo, yo)


I blitz the mic once I hear hype, the left tackler
Tackle a track like a hundred Lewis linebackers
Ninja rapper, lyric Eagle Claw Grappler
Blow the fuse off a thousand watt black after
Amplifier, cramp the liar, stamp the champ
Revamp the camp, blow your lamp fire
Fifty shots in the sky, for the Dig-I
T-A-L, you swine inside the pigsty
Spend the will of Dhama, face your Karma
In pursuit like the F1 bomber, huntin' down Osama
From my hood I know A Few Good Men of Honor
Hearts cold, stack gold like Old Man Palmer
Port land, I Trailblaze to Portland
Oregon, to watch Rasheed Wallace score again
To get cocky off a glass of hassake
And rice and seaweed, bein' soaked in wasabi
Nostril flared up, eyes tearin', and I'm nearin'
The point of no return, bitch, I'll have your blood smearin'


Yo, jumpin' out the Benz wagon, red Polo sweat saggin'
White tee, bandana, tan suade, Timbs draggin'
Fingers numb, from the thousand grams I finished baggin'
Coke on my hands, still smokin' dutches like a dragon
It's a M-E-T, H-O-D and, the L-A D-A-R-K Man
I'm the Duke, please bless me like Mike Krzyzewski
Two weak ass rappers beefin', don't impress me
My style's poise, W.E.B. Dubois
Spit stellar minature, that the world enjoys
To my Clan, I'm commited, Red Sea, ok, kid it
When I lead this toilet of a Earth, know I shitted




Say what? Ain't no pushin
Say what? None of that shit goin on
Yo


Made from the best shit on Earth
I bring it to ya first, sick verse from the thurst
In the darkness we lurk, load a cartridge and burst
On the scene, like a new team
Let 'em on our witness, the Method how I do things
Perfected, my routine's are hectic and knockin
General Electric, I'm shockin (bzzz)
Now who top ten, to rot and land once forgotten
Niggas poppin Crys' now, they stock market droppin
They poison, I'm the antitoxin, that keep the party rockin
And got me for us all, Johnny Cochran
Get me off, grant them the ball, if I walk
Put that order in the court, yeah
Give me crack on and who the fuck really care, yeah
World best prepare for Tical, to beware
Or be gone outta here, you be warned
Fuck all, get off that bullshit
And kick the fuckin tux off, now it's on


If it's on, then it's on
We can get it on, gat for gat
Track for track, song for song
If it's on, then it's on
We can get it on
So what ya want nigga, ya want nigga? huh?


You got the beat from another planet
Think I don't rock like granite
Lyrical giantical, submerge the Titanic
Panic with the frantic, antic watch them vanish
In the zone, by my own, maricon, if you Spanish
The outlandish, even though they can't stand us
You better off gettin pick a size, tryin to ban us
Either way you put it off, I'mma be heard
That's my word, Stone Cold, Goldberg
Like a nerve, don't fuck what ya heard
That nigga just started hangin out on the curb
What's the verdict, soundin like me, you can't word it
I put it in overdrive, while you short circuit
Worship the ground that I walk on
I brought on, all the real niggas that you talked on
Blahzay Blah, so on, it's a done deal, don't even go on
Soundin nauseous, to choke on strong, to get my smoke on




Talkin 'bout gats, ain't no bustin clacks, and ain't hustlin
Too many cats that wanna rap, and ain't sayin nuthin
Foolin ya self, how let ya ass do it to ya self
When it comes to cash, we the ones doin it, who else?
Walkin our dogs, ya cats better beat yours
Hot heat reach y'all, before you even get a chance to recharge
You weak paw, me and my street niggas a' eat y'all
We all, guess they ain't no question that we sure
B-song, soon as you throw the fuckin beat on
Dick riders ride, followers follow our lead on (you a fly guy)
I'ma have to air ya guys out
My shit is plat' before it even exit my mouth
S.I.N.Y. nigga, who wan' try?

In a whip, with no brakes and I'm hitting the gas

Still living by the code too many pretty women still living by the...
I'm just tryna get a meal
When I started rhyming wasn't tryna get a deal I was tryna get a feel
Homocide housing bodies lying in the Hill, man they nothing with me dying in the field especially when I'm tryna pay the bills
A lot of y'all relying on the steel
And see the court denying your appeal
If y'all don't know, nothing you better know its real
If it work like a workshop better know the drill
I'm past childish games, y'all just tryna take me outta my game
And calling my black women out of their name
I'm serious stay out of my brain
Understanding my slangs, Fast and Furious, stay out of my lane
Boy I'm hot, kids be calling me Blaze
In the industry I'm not, they be calling me slave
I ain't tryna burn the spot, but I'm setting my ways
I'm just a Product of the block and the city I'm raised
I'm still living by the code
Too many pretty women still living by the stroll daddy pimping them for dough
Early in the morning cops kicking in the do'
Man I Think somebody's snitching on the low
I caught my father sniffing on that snow
That's when he tried to tell me things are different than before
Kids don't listen any mo', thats fo' sho'
We used to ask permission from my fo'
Ain't no food up in the kitchen cause we broke
I ain't tryna miss Another, meal cause love it get you killed
And if it dont your baby mother will
But y'all ain't recognizing that is, real untill that undercover pulls his shield and now it's kinda late to cut the deal
So I ain't gotta tell you how I feel
While im tryna get my pockets stuffed with hundred dollar bills
I should've went to school and get a skill
But it wasn't in my future so I stealed, that's why I got this Ruger in ya' grill


Cracker treasure chest is one of the best
Now, feel the force of the full Court press
I apply to kiss the death, something for real the realness
Untouchable, Eliot Ness, you select of vet
Take me off the bench, I suppose to lynch,
The angel in the air you can smell my stench
Soldiers in the trench, moving east to west
I gave you a note, you can keep the rest
RIP the whole coast when I heat the flesh
At the greek fest, hit a couple of bars
Smash rips on strips like bumber cars
You're amongst the odds, with lies in the pelly
The baby, nine, the size of a celly
Now it's a dilemma like Nelly and Kelly
Milk Pirelli Tower when I peel it in a hurry with a fist of fury
Martini with a cherry is very necessary when I make it to the top
I'mma pop Halle Berry Staten Island fairy where the legends were made
In the staircase throw a rap grenade
Take it back in the day, get clapped for your chain
"F" the blood bath it will be half of the pain
He is a high grand bullet women call him daddy
Fish tank shoes jump out the Caddy
Grand finale yo the champ is here
The cameras glare under the chandelier
While you standing there, like you can hold it down
Its nine of us all of us rock the crown
Tear it down down to the last compound
New York mixed with a Compton style
Roll bonkers wild, on the stomping ground
Lay down the carpet when I'm walking down the isle
Then Telephone  keep stalking the child
Four misdemeanor now I'm going to trial
So secluded in exile like my sex while
Private jet style who's the livest vet now`
Pass me a wet towel don't get Vexed now
I ring it your chest when I let the tech growl


We used to rock um, leather gooses
With sheep skin coats and bombers
British Walkers, sharp skinned tailor made
Playboys black swede, three finger rings name plate rope chains
DVD, nylon cazal frames and matching with the Kangol hat
You couldn't have it, brother might snatch it
Flashback 1 90 E with the mock neck
Lee suit 25 nickels we shh
Fresh blue on white Pumawith the track Nike
Shell toe Adidas with the  no laces
Late night summer time jam we in the park
Allah Math cutting, DJ spitting his dart
Sergio Cassini brown swede bally
Jay crossed Town, 
Fresh leather Went to wether maximum spoiler kid
Legendary Duece flick Slick Rick
Run DMC, Jam master Jay
Wu-Tang Clan, Scott La Rock, KRS-ONE

Bizzy Killa Bee, yeah yeah
See crack never kept me high longer than five minutes
Wallaby Clarks  of course silk and linen
Jumbos two for five come and get it
Mamma cries tears of fear when I was wilding son
Please dont wear that, people are getting killed for that
Latin quarter union Square you had to be there
The fever, MC glory, ripping the armoury
This is Hip Hop to me, and for all of y'all, this is Wu-Tang Clan
Signing off, you know how we do forever


Ay yo I gotta be around this music it's therapeutic
Lick my first  blunt off the day then start the movement
I'm chilling in a room with a view, there's always room for improvement
So I grab my coat and go and prove it
Its me against the world, you can find me in the streets
You don't spot me in the lobby probably find me in a freak
Cop Ferraris, the law be in the lining of my seats
Tryna put me in a line up till I wind up in a beast
That's the belly, how dare they tryna tell me when to eat?
With this plate of food barely in my reach
My team shoot dice, we used to shoot skelly in the streets
Wore the same pelli pelli for a week
But now we live the life, its such a good Life
I wish that I could live it twice
I'll probably make the same wish my wife
It's Wu-Tang Clan always collect cheddar
Proper education always correct error


Crime scene, coppers and sirens helicopters
High beam the tension is Rising
Fiends keeping they pipes Clean
This is what life's mean?
A dollar and a dream everybody wants nice things
The kid was only 19, hole in his chest now, he's fighting
For his last breath to seeing death is frightening
The grip on the ghetto is tightening
You try to do the right thing, and they do you just like King
Now I can hear the night scream sirens and light beams
 bad shots, hitting people that they didn't mean to pop
The neighbourhood's in shock, block extremely hot
Another black teen shot is a normal routine for cops
They should've got good grades, work the minimum wage
Now they lying on the stretcher with nothing in them to save
Keep it ghetto, and whatever ghetto you at
Just don't love the ghetto, cause the ghetto don't love you back


Gotta be around this music it's therapeutic
First fresh thought to tell you so clear
When I'm Walking my head, There's a voice that talks
In my ear, I can hear it so clear (you Think im bugging right)


The average man, wouldn't last that lang
She like to work out run Marathons
She wear, tight skirts with no panties on
She's a 6 foot 1 bronze amazon
Saying, complaining about all the good men gone
I'm from Babylon she reach the 
Holding jails in the nail salons
She rock Coco Chanel her smell was strong
With skin like velvet, she rocked my bags
She gave, no 
She a spread eagle at the tip of the bed
She rubbed on her legs this is what I said
Rap music is therapeutic to me
Rap music is therapeutic to me


Ay yo You ain't lived 'till you made your first million
And top models wanna pop out yo Children

Way Before rap moving crack in your building
Yeah, now whats the price of rice in China
These women tryna raise the price of her vagina
Me, Im tryna live and get the grinder
Like Diddy, but I ain't tryna give the Shyne up
Pop pop pop off no question
See Ol' Dirty like it raw no protection
When the kid hold court no objections
Meth needs his Money out the door no exepction
I go hard in the paint on a rapper

You Think im tripping, aiming the trick and
But keep a snow Bunny in the kitchen I'm the master like Killa

When I started rhymin' wasn't trynna get a deal
I was trynna get a feel
Homicide housing, bodies lyin' in the hill
Man ain't nothing worth me dying in the field
Especially when I'm trynna pay the bills
A lot of y'all relying on the steel
And see the court denying your appeal
If y'all don't know nothing, you better know it's real
If it works like a workshop, better know the drill
I'm past childish games
Y'all just trynna take me outta my game
And call my black women outta their name
I'm serious, they're out of my brain
Understand that my slang's
Fast and furious, they're out of my lane
Boy I'm hot, kids be calling me blaze
In the industry I'm not, they be calling me slave
I ain't trynna burn the spot, but I'm set in my ways
I'm just a product of the block, and the city I'm raised, Aha
I'm still living by the code
Too many pretty women still living by the strode
Daddy pimping 'em for doe
Early in the morning cops kicking in the do'
Man I think somebody snitching on the low
I caught my father sniffing on that snow
That's when he try to tell me things are different than befo'
Kids don't listen any mo', that's for sho'
We used to ask permission from our folks
Ain't no food up in the kitchen cause we broke
And I ain't trynna miss another meal
Cause love will get you killed
And if it don't, your baby mother will
But y'all ain't recognizing that it's real
Until that undercover pull a shield
And now it's kinda late to cut a deal
So I ain't gotta tell you how I feel
Why I'm trynna keep my pockets stuffed with hundred dollar bills
I should'a went to school and got a skill
But it wasn't in my future so I steal
That's why I got this Ruger in your grill




You know? Through being humbles
True Mast' on the track. Like that, you know?
Been in this rap game for like the past..
Four bullets now, you know? Doing bids, yeah-yeah
I done peeped a lotta cats come through
Courageous cats, stray cats, ha-ha
Top cats with top hats, you know what I'm saying?
But it all boils down to this: we talking lyrics
Rhymes, line for line - numero uno, who the best? I don't know
Check it


Flame on, I rain fire, when Johnny Storm
I'm shocking like live wire, you have been warned
I prolong this next chamber, to make it strong
And prove all them doubters wrong
Killin 'Em Softly with this song, adding on
Let them toes get they tag on, dead men run no marathons
On my shift, shooting that gift, knowin' he snitched
On the telethon, running his lips, sinking the ship
Give back what his mother gave him, mother made him
And now she can't even save him, Johnny Blaze 'em
Send him to his final resting
Back to the essence, Faces of Death, the Final Lesson


Torture, torture, torture
Mothafuckin' torture, y'all niggas know


Who got John Blaze shit?
Sucking my dick to get famous
So I switched Blaze to Dangerous
Welcome to my torture chambers, torture chambers
Where John Doe's remain nameless, hear me?
I know it's Def Jam, but think clearly
I made it possible for y'all cats to come near me
Keep your enemies, close and your heat closer
I slam just like my culture on all theories
Dead that, straight off the meat rack with this one
You get burned playing Nix-on, Hot Biscuit
Stand back, don't make me spit one, and paint pictures
On the walls of your mental
With hot lead from out these pencils
Iron Lung since I was young and not knowing
Where the next meal was coming from, been troublesome
To all those posing a threat
If I go, everybody gotta go next, y'all niggas know
The code of the street soldier, I'm watching time
And time watching me colder, Grim Reaper
Breathing death on my shoulder
Waiting for the day to take me over, take me over




That you can never touch my flow, go 'head and hate me
Still tryna fuck my ho, Johnny-come-latelies?
Got me in a world of shit, and now I'm pissed
Mama said there'd be days like this
This the Season for Ducks and my pen's bleeding
Leaving kids barely breathing for sneak-thieving
Famished from lack of eating and lack of teaching
Banished from Rhyme and Reason for high treason
Can it be, that the kid with the knock knees
Got G to make a grown man cop pleas, for this track
I got a Lovebug like Starski
Blow back, until I drop Tical Part 3
Ain't no stopping when you start me, John Jay
Pulling your card, mayday mayday, niggas owe they life to God
And now it's payday, take it how ya wanna take it
Fully clothed or butt-naked, I learned the hard way
Ain't nothing sacred in this world, time to face it
Johnny Basic, instinct, I'm sure to make it
While others fake it, fuck the spotlight, G-O-D already got light
Say what you like, just spell my name right
No doubt, this one goes out, to all you trout-fish
Cake niggas, keep my dick up out your mouth






Wu Block
Ayo Ghost I'm about to go in right here son


Yo there's no place to hide, tints on the window
Three fifty-seven pointed out the ride, treat 'em like a dutch
Dump his insides, blood on the door, blood on the floor
They ready for the battle I'm prepared for the war
Money on stupid, soldiers on call
Follow you for real, chase niggas through the mall
Rolls on the table I'll show you how to ball
Don don I blow weed on the weave with no shirt on I got tricks up my sleeve
Suffocate flow make it hard to breathe, I don't want that bitch I'm just that hard to leave
Yea, you see the goons that I bring, D-Block chillin' with the wallaby king
My Staten Island niggas they gon' let that shit ring, my dudes locked up hold it down in the bing
Police think I'm carrying like every kind of drug, I just say what's up, no dap, no hug
I just keep it movin', I see they all fake but they don't really want beef they like Common Sense and Drake


Ayo yo Ghost check this out right, I just killed one of your classics
It's only right you kill one of mines, you got me son?
Let's go


When Nas made one love I was on the bench still
Mask on, contemplating a kill with one glove
In deep thought, paper bag cover my o.e
Heard they got long nickels slangin' the four deep
Uh, Medina niggas, Gowanus and Park Slope
Mad heavy, cashmere low coats
Pumpin' at the joy spot, stepped to this fiend
Served him from Queen, he had a nose like Floyd Pops
Armed him with a trey deuce, tell him to knock twice
Tell 'em you want two, show 'em your nice bike
The door knob turned, somebody cracked it
Bernard walked in, I'm right behind him with the all black ratchet
Surprise bitches, welcome to Staten
The first nigga that flinched I blast him, the fiends laughing
Foot locker bags unwrapped raw, stacks on the table
The nigga I shot beginnin' to crawl, he in his boxers
Seen the ounce on the plate with oxys, baggin' up mad shake
Yo B, yo watch him, while I search the fridge, cabinets and the back room
Half a brick in the grits box and the vacuum
Drugs is what we all about, cash and it's all around
Tell them niggas to get on they face and pat 'em down
I got the goods let's be out son, slingin' of a nigga head
Word to everything they get out done, let's kill these niggas



Here we go
Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behavin' like they all too good
There lived a lil' boy who was misled
By anotha lil' boy and this is what he said, check it:
"Me and you kid, we gonna make some cash
Robbin' old folks and makin' tha dash"
They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sista and her brotha
Tried to rob a man who was a D.C. undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic, he said
I got you all in check
Yah Yah Yah, Yah Yah
Yah Yah Yah, Yah Yah
Yah Yah Yah, Yah Yah
Yah Yah Yah, Yah Yah
When I step up in the place
Ay yo I step correct
Woo-Hah ,got you all in check
I got that head nod ****
Make you break your neck
Woo-Hah, I got you all in check
And you know we come through
To wreck the disco tech
Woo-Hah, I got you all in check
Throw your hands up in the air
Don't ever disrespect
Woo-Hah
I got you all in check
YO Grimm!
What's up?
Which muthaphucka stole my flow
Eenie....meenie miney mo
Throw that type of nigga right out my window
Blast your ass hit you with my direct blow
Bo!! Coming through like G.I. Joe
Star Wars movie deal like Han Solo
Make you bounce around like this was calypso
Always shine cause I got the high pro glow
You think that you can hide you think you can lay low
Roll up on your ass like Hawaii 5-0
Mad out with my dreads in my kango
Forget the Moet nigga just pass the Cisco
Yo!! Take a trip down to Mexico
Come back with that **** that might make you psycho
Maximum frequencies through that stereo
Sorry this is it but homeboy I got to go
Yo, where you go where you at bring it back!
Props to all my people on the hip hop scene who going fast than me
Without much sheen my inspiration from youth killa bee got loose
The M.E.T.H.O.D. Man won't kick with a jew
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man

Hey you get off my cloud
Let me get raw with my southpaw style
Mover, puffin' on a fat blunt from Cuba
It's the Meth-Tical jet to Cal, I'm the buddha
Monk on the hunt for machine gun foes
I keeps you open like a slug from the shotgun punk
Double-barrel, yeah Meth bring it to them proper
Partner, you ain't got no wins in me casa
Straight up, you movin' too fast so baby wait up
Took one, added seven more now you eight up
Get on down wit' your bad self
Get on down, listen to the sound, come on
Few can ever get this whole commit legit
See you all up in my dick
But you don't know sh*t, uh-huh
What's your definition of a real emcee
From what you dedicated, hey it must be me
Meth-Tical, a lewd descendant of the loud hip-hop
I go on to the break of dawn, and just don't stop
Give me the green light, and the sign one way
Have you had your meth today
Huh, move it in, move it out
Stick it in, pull it out
Shake it up, shake it down
Come on down, Meth-Tical
Oh I often pray that I will
But today I am still
Just a...

M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man






Yo, yo-yo, yo
90's era Nasty, yeah
Yo, Ty Beats!


I need some time alone
Cold, my rhymes will turn your mind to stone
That's the work of satan niggas be hatin' but I'm a pot of gold
This ain't just me rappin' it's real and somethin' you gots to know
Catch a mark nigga hatin', get him a casket, that bastard's 'bout to go
Whoa, Nasty baby I'm crazy, the 90's raised me
I'm just as smart, probably smarter than half the cats who play me
Brazy, drivin' Miss Daisy, hand on my strap
In my zone, mind on my money like where that shit at?
I'm all alone, that's my only hope
And be damned if I'ma chase that with some phony homes, on the real
It be the ones that say, "We got this, that you ain't alone"
As long as I'm here to pull out the Glock 9 and cocked it
He mad you got rich but on the low you should've watched him
Cats connivin', head first into the livest object
"That was your man, now you 'bout to die quick"
Over some fly shit, you feel reminded of your fast-life ventures
And winters, blinded 'til the flashlight enters


I got a funky-funky style with a funky swag
I got a funky-funky style with a funky swag
I bought the funky-funky Nikes, got the hat to match
I bought the funky-funky Nikes, got the hat to match
I got a funky-funky style with a funky swag
I got a funky-funky style with a funky swag
And when I kill 'em with the flow, ain't no comin' back
And when I kill 'em with the flow, ain't no comin' back, back, back


I got a poor man's panache, I be stretchin' the cash
I'm a little passive aggressive, you get a stretcher when I'm mad
Borderline manic depressive, rappers stressin' me bad
Got too many less than impressive rappers left in my path
Better yet, we gon' leave 'em left in the past
Someone slides, this time I ride, you get left in the back
Who am I? I'm a titan so be expectin' a clash
Start to wavin' arms at you, you'd think I'm catchin' a cab
No questions, live the answers cause if you're lookin' to ask
Look at Meth, breakin' bad like he cookin' meth in the lab
Still a lethal weapon but try and bless him with math
Rappers never learn their lesson so I ain't lettin' 'em pass
I ain't lettin' 'em brag, I ain't lettin' 'em swag
Fuck swag, just bein' blunt, while I'm pluckin' my ash
Y'all ain't up in my class in the buildin'
It's A$AP Meth, quick to kill 'em, that's an ASAP death


I got a funky-funky style with a funky swag
I got a funky-funky style with a funky swag
I bought the funky-funky Nikes, got the hat to match
I bought the funky-funky Nikes, got the hat to match
I got a funky-funky style with a funky swag
I got a funky-funky style with a funky swag
And when I kill 'em with the flow, ain't no comin' back
And when I kill 'em with the flow, ain't no comin' back, back, back


Straight out the back, dog, I'm Shaq strong, I'm breakin' backboards
Draped in Tommy, my bitch beside me, young god body
I play the back of clubs, clique of foul youngins that's rowdy
Fools get rowdy, ain't nothin' dumb, my guns from Saudi
High off the Maui, don't trip your weed, rollin' the finest
You know the fronto, Sucio Guapo, I'm head honcho
I sport the poncho, connects with Sandro, the illest y'all know
Killin' 'em pronto, my funky fresh is filthy, designer
But check my rhymes though, my verse is like atomic bombs, yo
Haters like side hoes, I peel off in the illest Tahoe
Watch out for potholes, H leanin', that's why he drive slow
Nast Diablo, the 90's era shit in effect
Clowns be watchin', best protect ya necks

Told ya all niggas what? huh?
Told these mothafuckers nigga!


I got a funky-funky style with a funky swag
I got a funky-funky style with a funky swag
I bought the funky-funky Nikes, got the hat to match

And when I kill 'em with the flow, ain't no comin' back
And when I kill 'em with the flow, ain't no comin' back, back, back

Back

What y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
This '97
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to '79


I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultraviolet shine blind forensics
I inspect you, through the future see millennium
Killer Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets, Queen Bees ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block


As the world turns, I spread like germ
Bless the globe with the pestilence
The hard-headed never learn
This my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life standing firm
On foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
Transform into the Ghost Rider
A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire
Who got my back in the line of fire holding back?
What? My peoples if you with me, where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
What the blood clot? We smoke pot and blow spots
You want to think twice? I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums


I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
Vocabulary 'Donna talking, tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what? Run for your brother kid
Run for your team and your "six can't rhyme" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme, your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts, paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought
I got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God


The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang


Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape Hell globe spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anaesthesias
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings


March of the wooden soldiers, C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square we stay in gold like Flair
Escape from your dragon's lair
In particular my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat bass lines on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck, I'm ducking five-year probation


War of the masses, the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song


The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none


Yo Yo Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink, you had a Navy green
Salamander fiend, bitches overheard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cork-pop convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese, is that so?
Ceaser needs the greens, it's Earth
Ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz


Aiyo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer, Blue-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor world tranquilizer
Adjust the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening
Guaranteed made 'em jump like Rod Strickland






Weve just received a report that New York City is under attack by swarms of killer bees. Theyve been seen approaching from Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. We urge you to stay in your homes at this time, as we will be bringing you up-to-the-minute information. This just in: Police are reporting that theres a man on top of a skyscraper, ready to jump. Im told that he is possibly Ol Dirty, a member of the Wu-Tang Clan. The police suspect that there could be some connection between this old dirty man, and the killer bees

Forreal? Can I get a juice, lord?
Yeah, yeah... yeah, squad niggas boy, forreal
Uh-huh, forreal, man, word, open the door, man
Hustle flow shit, yeah, aiyo, pass the cigar, lord
Come on, man, stop playing, man


We in the cabin playing backgammon, gorilla monster slammers
Brothers hire us, try us you gon' die, son
Green medicine, blow veterans
Run in Adidas store, six more velours, drawers feather skin
Haircutted up, hollering, seven through three sixes
No, we ain't the devil, where ya llama, dick?
Can't stand the other side, niggas know we rich, we color guys
Loose up your mother, true lullabies
Gangsta ever readies, take off my shirt, no batteries, nigga
Just one mean magnum killer
Snowmobiles jetting out the Timber, feel Chef altitude
Yo, I can't breathe, check the splendor
Brazilian honey dip, I'm on my rifle day, nigga
Times is roughing, Timberland cuffing
One knee up, G up all the re-up
Hope we can pull it back, my throat my only weapon, blow the beat up


Stuff Brillo pads in the rat holes, reduce that faggot ass nigga
Who wanna jump like a frog to a tadpole
Gag it up, sliding through the ER, batted up
A tube in your dick, you can't piss when standing up
Hands is shaking, doctors is taken to operating
"Nah, he might not live!" So they start debating
You in bad shape, in the neck of New York
Your slithering ways, lay with you a bad snake
Smash bake, eight stab holes in your shoulder blades
You wilding on the stretcher and shit, they trynna hold your legs
Nah don't hold his legs, tell that bitch ass nigga to chill
Put something in his meat like bolognese
Got gophers that sleep in the woods, Carhartt down
Padlock your bow-legged spot, where your rocks now?
You ain't moving no crack, you'se a moving ass rat
After you lay up in that morgue, I'mma fuck your back
Yeah, nigga, die slow with your smirk on
Night-night lights, dim it down, get your mirk on
Later I see you in hell, get your burn on
Filled with embalming fluid, get your sherm on


My sherm on in the hood when I ride by
My eyes looking like I learned how to skydive
The world is yours, there's rules you abide by
Ride with the fly guy on I-95
They said a nigga return, but I never left
I told Big L through me, he could resurrect
I'm that nigga like Puff in L-O-X
I took one L and life is still Double X
Brick City where I breathe all the trees at
The E's in M&M's, I need a Relapse
And bitches, grab my mic, give me feedback
Reggie you an asshole, baby I be that
Yeah, I get cocky when the beat pumping
You know you doing it when your tire lip running
I keep a freak and I call her chicken McNugget
Cuz this Superbad nigga, she McLovin'


Fiends get killed in my hallways, we parlay
My feet been killing me all day
Your boy down for lot, like them killas in RahWay
It's all work and no play, cuz this block ain't nothing like Broadway
Revenge is sweeter than sorbet, you all become believers
Once this heaters in your face, just a part of my feng shui
Ya'll don't want no part of the gun spray
I would hate to pull it and one stray
That's where the innocents by stand, we trapped inside these tenements like damn
Why mama trynna feed us this spiced ham
Connects trynna cheat us with light grams
Co-defendants try to lighten they sentence, snitching to white man
Turned state evidence, fam, we ain't jellin'
Felons ain't felons no more, they straight tellin'
Ain't nothing worse than a rat, you can't smellin'
And ain't nothing worse than a trap you can't sell in




Jeeeez!

Now right
You know you dead wrong
Yo know...
Turn me up, turn me up

Jab me with a fuckin' spoon

You know you dead wrong
For this one right here baby, for real

Yo, yo, yo
Another day, another dollar
Sharks wanna bite don't bother
Cause this rhymes the truth, and
The truths hard to swallow
Don Dada, hard act to follow
See Rockwilder with the iced out dog collar
My crew want it all
This bout is scheduled for one fall
We can build or we can brawl
Yes y'all, last call for alchahol, damn!
Monkey wrench fuckin' up the whole program

Chorus:


Ooh
Them don't no have to respect me
Ooh
Them don't no have to come correctly
Ooh
Can't hear nothin' but the music I'm slippin'
Big head nigga's don't listen

Hot N-I-X, my complex got a complex
Livin' in apartment complex
I'm cashin' chin checks every first and fifteenth
Failed my urinalasist, they threw me in the clink
5-0's can't stop the pot roll, Jonny
Still Blaze, send young mc's to the potty
Its side ways nine fifteen
Be aware of the fatal flyin' guilintines
Are you prepared?

Chorus:

Ooh
Them don't no have to respect me
Ooh
Them don't no have to come correctly
Ooh
Time flow constantly the way time flow
I live by the code, style is mad P.L.O

My crew swarm in, tell a bitch please
Didn't mama tell you about the birds and the bees?
Especially them killa's
Girls night out with gorrillas (Meth acting like monkey)
Too slow ya' blow catterpilla
Son got game
And he pack a Rosco, ?fleat coal? train
Player we ain't playin'
Crush assossiated labels, don't let me in, I push my way in...
(Meth interupts with coughing)
As I was sayin', I push my way in, fuck it
How many suffered
For this Hip-Hop, if I can't see it, can't trust it
Tic-toc when will that fake shit stop?
Flip flop battery go dead in the clock

Chorus:

Ooh
Them don't no have to respect me
Ooh
Them don't no have to come correctly
Ooh
Can't hear nothin' but the music I'm slippin'
Big head nigga's don't listen

Stapleton, the wild west Park Hill
Port Richmond, Now Born jungle nill
We dumbin', stunnin', bartender keep em comin
Nigga's with alchahol problems, a hundred miles and runnin', yeah
Meth, I came here for crooks but I'm still here
Called me every name in the book but I'm still here
What up doc?
This Looney Toon got 'em shell shocked
Anvils droppin' out the sky once my hand cock
Back, I check you in to the smack down hotel, while everythings black
I'm like the cast in Belly I don't know how to act on wax
Rockwilder bring it on back

Chorus:

Ooh

"Bus driver -- this here gal refused to give me her seat!"


Everybody... huh, yeah
Yeah, uh, uh, uh, now, uh, yeah, yo


What up my people equal?, this be Tical: The Prequel
Shine up the desert eagle, light up that extra lethal
I mean that "ooh wee", three years and two g's
I'm back with new trees, I wrapped in loose leafs
While ya'll was just rappin', who get the set crackin'?
Just like a neck snappin', let's get this next platinum
What's happ'n Def Jam? Remember Meth Man?
I held your hand through them years when ya'll was stressed, fam
That's why I still love you and Russell still hustle
Let's get to pumpin' iron, and flex some real muscle
Up in this bitch due, my click is Rick Rude
And I ain't got the ivory, this ain't the flick, dude
Somebody told me, ya'll can't hold me
Naughty By Nature, do my dirt all by my lonely
You need back off bitch, you don't know me
Got to leave these hoes alone, they too nosey


Meth is killin', M.C. killin'
What more can I say, stop grillin'
That's what niggas get for actin' Hollywood
And since ya'll understood... would you?
Would you? Would you? Would you?
Uh huh, that dollar day, that dollar dollar day, ey
That dollar day, that dollar dollar day, ey


Ok, the love issue, don't let that love get you
My brothers love pistol, doin' they thug dizzle
Bet ya'll ain't know, did you?, that I'm a pro, did you?
Until the flow hit you, fuck it, I'm official
Bone wit more gristle, thrown from chrome nickel
Place that don't tickle, can't wait to zone wit you
I'm hard as stone chisel, Meth got his own little
Formula to go triple -- for shizzle
Ya'll know my occupation, I'm puttin' in the work
So any imitation, I'm puttin' in the dirt
That shit is aggravatin', why ya'll procrastinatin'
I got some massive waitin', and she probably masturbatin'
Welcome to New Yitty, where half is two fifty
If I got a problem, then that's one problem too many
So don't tempt me, I'll bust until I'm empty
Swiftly, that way, I get the chance to take you with me, muthafucka!




Yo, I got style, H rap round, back up and back down
Act up, we back clown, last up to bat now
It's me Ticallion, swing like Barry Bonds
Mommy got a ratty thong, happy cuz daddy gone
Turn it up it a little bit, a notch, and it'll get
Cook it once the griddle gets so hot, good lookin' kid
Ok, now where was I? Prepared, was I
Your man broke his jaw tryin' to say what I
Say on this mic, not a day in your life, could ya
Say I ain't nice, could ya? If I ain't nice, would ya?
Get off my dick and tell your bitch to come her, she stuntin'
Can hear me "cummin'" like my dick's in her ear or somethin'
I put that on my momma, she put that on her kids
He put that chrome on your dome and blowed ya fuckin' wig
That's how it is, ask Bobby Dig'
We back on your block, with 'nuff shots to give, muthafucka!

Right, oh y'all know what I'm sayin'
Trackmasters, what up?


Yo, you remind me of this chick I knew, used to pursue
She wouldn't let the Meth' Man screw, but let the crew
So I did what any man in that situation would do
Go find him something new that's gon' keep it gangsta, too
Don't take it personal, I just call it the way I see
And what I see is not a potential wife to be
So basically, there it is and there it go
I'll pass this time, but next lifetime who knows?
Anything I suppose


See, the thing about you, that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl I'm-a try
You need to sit down, this may take a while....
See, this girl she sorta looks like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

 (Blu Cantrell)
You remind me of a girl that I once knew (Once upon a time)
See her face whenever I, I look at you
Wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
(You remind me, yeah) This is why I just can't get with you


I can recall a certain magic in your eyes
Although we are just meeting, I feel as though I already know you
It's such a shame that you remind me of a past love, my worst love
So sorry, but I can't get with you cause remind me, yeah


You remind me of a guy that I once knew (you remind me, yeah)
See his face whenever I, I look at you
Wouldn't believe all of things she put me through (yeah)
This is why I just can't get with you

 {Method Man}
I know it's so unfair to you (ha)
It's so unfair
That I relay her ignorance to you (whoa, I)
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me.... (you remind....)
{Yes, yes y'all, don't stop y'all
To the beat y'all, Trackmasters and ya don't stop}


It's just somethin' about ya
That got me not knowin' if I wanna kiss ya or slap the shit out ya
My bad, I'm losin' myself, don't get me wrong
It's just that oil and water don't get along
Take it from somebody that know, been there befo'
I used to where my heart on my sleeve, not anymo'
Ask Usher and Blu, nothin' hurt me more than your love do
I put that on my life and The 'W'
You remind me

 {Blu Cantrell}
{I can't get with you}
You remind me of a girl that I once knew {Once upon a time}
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Said I...)
Wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
{Sweet thing this is why} This is why I just can't get with you

 {Usher}
{Gotta let you go}
You remind of a guy that I once knew
See his face whenever I, I look at you (You remind me, yeah)
Wouldn't believe all of the things he put me through (Everything that you do, yeah)
{This is why I just can't get with you}




Yo.. yeah
Don't erase none of that good shit in the beginnin
Yo.. spill drinks on ya, get stank on ya
Yo.. yo.. pinky ring shit, yo
That pinky ring shit, yo


It's that pinky ring shit, the legend of masked kid
Shoot out the speakers when my guns get jurassic
Superbad, who am I? Dolemite classic
The vandal's back, hands on Angela Bassett
I handle my plastic, gunplay I mastered
No coke, dope mixed down with acid on record
Broken down and crafted in seconds
Lady's choice, the golden voice still peppered
Better, respect it, bitch believe
I pull rabbits out the hat, tricks up my sleeves
I air out the showroom, the shit can breathe
Fix your weave, behold my expertise


I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back
I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back


Take it back to the peoples, leanin' gettin' rec room punch
We in them authentic alley switchin joints
Major general niggas, five stars
Both arms rock when coke dropped we read a hundred niggas palms
Silencers, garbage bags of hash
For every cop we paid retired now the nigga on smash
Gash you out your burner fast
You swing down hatin me now respect get your fingers off the glass




Yo what the fuck yo?! Yo what the fuck y'all comin for?
Get the fuck away from my door!
We got big guns in here, coke over there
With blue bag and E pills stashed under the chair
And there's Boss Hog black and white pit with the pink lips
Stan thought he was soft 'til he bit his fingers
The shit had me dyin yo, big fat nigga bleedin
Big cat nigga all season
On the beach truck, stuck with Hawaiian ice
Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought FUBU
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
18 karat rap between noodles




Up at Killa Bee headquarters, four whips just pulled up
I saw Johnny sippin Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin off the hip
I sit took three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead king, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ".. Any Means Necessary"


John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all get shot


New York, New York, legendary rhyme boss
Code name Charlie Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
You crash-tests can't measure the threat
I dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah
Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin, feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself
The Noble, Sir I mass mogul
Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals


This is grown man talkin, coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect father Eton with Addies
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see


From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets




{*scratching "Suuuuuuuue" until fade*}




Hey boo! Yeah did you remember the tip of tender fender bender
From last September you let me enter the center
So we went through the Winter
Then we had a little prob, now we let it solve
Now you think that you get robbed, if you're givin bod
Well I'm stickin to the kitten cause it's hittin
The only way I be splittin if you pick it for money and trick it
You wanna dip, this is the brick you pick
So you ain't dismissed until both sets of lips kiss
It's the mother number one the phunky Phillified
The chilly side, Boyz II Men and women with the illy vibe
So until it's nineteen ninety (nine)
Just vibe with me and smile like you wifey for life, B


 Too high to get over
 Yeah yeah
 Too low to get under
 Yeah yeah
 Too high to get over
 Yeah yeah
 Too low to get under...arm me with harmony


We're just, vibin

 Bad Boy, Bad Boy
 Haa!  We just vibe to the beat
 That's right
 The Mackalicious funk flav
 Gotta get the cash
 Ah one two y'all!
 Gotta get, gotta get the dough


Craig Mack's got a lot in store for MC's so please listen
Fake rappers stop booin and hissin
My shit's the bomb, like nitroglycerin
Electrifying, if I said I wasn't I'd be lying
On the fader, from here to Grenada
Dope demonstrater creator of the force like hey Darth Vader
You imitator, I'm greater than your data
MC's run up so then they pack this doggie bag for later
I'm the, wisdom-mystical
Hyper-scientifical
Do your typical write rhymes get loaded take a miracle
To lyrical whip, the word dick on the side tip
Rhymes to flip, Hercules ain't got a tighter grip
Whoever said that you couldn't be beat?  Well have a seat
Grab a spoon, taste some defeat
I shake MC's down directly to the ground
Boyz II Men make the world go round




How ya feel?
Party people, how ya feel?
Let me know if everything remains real!
Word up!  Tell me how ya feel!
I feel good tonight, talk to me tell me how do ya feel
So that everything's alright
Word is bond!  Busta Rhymes keep it comin one time for your mind
Flip Mode y'all, yo


WHOOOO! That music feel my cool breeze
Make you bang your head from hear to overseas, now!
You feel the charge that we be generatin, conversatin
Always get taken by vibes that be penetratin
I make you feel the sensation like we come into
The last days of Revelation, sometimes that's how we be vibin
Yes I'm gonna keep you smilin
Hit you then I take you on a ride just like Coney Island
One two three it's simply you and me
While you listen I MC
Blow your mind and make you really want to par-ty
Ohh ohh! Take those bars and keep em swingin
Ohh!  Sometimes it makes me want to start singin
But I keep on bringing ...
... and swinging you better believe I keep your bells ringing
Feel the motion and the magic potion while we in the dancehall
With Boyz II Men we bring the universal vibe y'all!
Bring the universal vibe y'all
One time, Flip Mode is forever
Y'all get down and feel my thing
Guaranteed to make your fat butt swing
One time while I get on




Here come that real rap shit
Criminology, yeah
I mentally stab your brain with the pain
While other brothers spit mad game I spit flames
You know my fuckin name, write joints with Mary J
Johnny Blaze get methed right because it pays
Life insurance indeed as we proceed
To give the track menstraul cramps until it bleeds
Who the bad guy?  It's I, the chinky eye
Knotty-head, rugged MC, from N.Y
City, my whole rap committee get busy
My roots date back to Kizzy, now ask who is he?
Lady sings the blues then, I take it as a gem
That's able to raise Boyz II Men
A thousand, young black kids from out the housing
Projects, ready to catch wreck, Ticallion
The center of attraction, guaranteed satisfaction
Stop the yappin make it happen baby




Apocalypse Now, mind over matter
Next batter be Tical, put it on a platter
How much uncut raw shit we dealing with?
Murder track what? Slang killing it, touched
You feeling it in your bloodstream
Deadly Venomous elixir hammer like Sledge that be Sister
All In Together Now, follow me the Mister
Mef Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh
Death come in the scripture, 2001
Bring the rap Armageddeon, let it be known
When you walk up in this Dead Zone, with all that wack shit
Now you know you dead wrong, one thousand lashes


Detonate that, pussy Massengil rap cleanse that
The kids rank, snatch collars off while riding off
Float boat big boys, Oakland A's stashed away blades
Ventilation let the sharks Animaze
Something shiest like seven butcher knives
Rolling Rover style twice, finger itchy like lice, hair fell out
Something to conquer, stomp ya like that cat Blanka
Toy Tonka truck, ten carat on ya monster
Ring rocky like fuck switch sides like water rides
The DAT bubble life preserve the other guys
Now fuck y'all act wilder
The style wilder than a praying mantis, chilling like
(long inhale)


As my brothers and I reign rebellious, changing
The courses of time, devils no longer exist
As God Cipher Divine, all minds one, no question
Now check it
Perhaps we can go through Lessons
Or might shot me a pussy protesting
Coming with that lip professing, you must take Allah for fool
Where's his Jewel? Was he using Mathematics as a tool?
Tell me, the struggle is God and I came to build
Shit is so real, inside you distilled
Back in the form of mist, you wishing you did the Knowledge
Before speaking, seeking, where you went wrong
And why would I bring you such physical harm?


Mind arson, my squadron surround the SoundGarden
Guns for hire plus you under fire and a target
Sniper in the cypher, I Pied Piper
Move the housing by the thousand, I watched out the Chrysler
Bombs strike ya like the Mighty Thor, blast the door
Recite a page like a tidal wave crash the shore
Two pulls, I'm wild like mechanical bulls
Pack a full house, it's girls night out, pull a handful
Heavenly laced, stimulation make it feel slow paced
I motivate and await my sober state


Magnificent, heavenly the God stay bent
Five Percent, Range whipping, Soul Controller of the lynch
Macking phone rings, Stephen King drama down at Danzine
My mood swings, suplexed off the rope, magazine
Coconut juice, walnut colored shoe, ninth annual
Moses lost his sandal hiding the manual
Blowing evangel bugging off of Bon Jovi hits
Grandma Lowvey, famous murder weapon was a trophy
Seeds posing in Osh Kosh, guzzle Grolsch
Sabotage massage rap bandit at large
Wolverine Carnation Milk, Wu denim jeans
Thurston Howell the Third, kid's back on the scene
Call it chopped meat cause every word is choppy
Malachi crunch all crows to death, Kobayashi couldn't stop me
Getting caught up in my world, Hagen-Dazs swirl
Back flip and then a twirl, cave your whole world in




"Walk on" (yeah, yeah, yeah)


It's Meth, back on that old shit
Pick my ho's with the same finger I pick my nose with
These flows get, hotter than most chicks, get the picture
I'm focused, got nothing but cock for cock-roaches, bitch, I'm gone before you noticed
Ducking these coppers, try'nna make the coldest
Spot you with the bricks and the baking sodas
Me and my soldier, we taking over, taking payola
From all these stations and record labels, they killing culture, tell 'em niggas
"Walk on"


Yo, I blow ya minds, like Kurt Cobain
My block is hot like Lil' Wayne, I'll pop ya little chain
I'm ready, hip hop is not gon' be the same
Like the Roc and Dame, I'll dot the little change
Nigga, I ain't scared, boy, yes sir
If I wasn't a beast, you niggas wouldn't whisper
I'm like, y'all can fuck y'all self, I'm getting paid daily
Plus keepin' it real, keep you broke, can't tell me, nigga "Walk on"


Huh, now go say that I don't quiver, and any chick
Caught with dirt under her nail's a gold digger
Yeah, I tell the people, like I told RZA
Man, I got Meth and on the day that I don't, I'll let you know, nigga
Nah, no carbon copies, they ain't got me, but they can watch me
Jewels jingling, middle finger at paparazzi
Not too cocky, but still, ain't too many niggas can top me
So bounce you foes and pull ya shoes up, nigga "Walk on"


Don't even blink, think fast, make the right move
Got a gun on ya, like Pinky had on Ice Cube
I don't play, homey, I got my stripes, too
I'mma sky high-a-trist, I smoke in a flight suit, nigga
Recognize, like Sam Sneed'll "back down"
You sick and tired of wack niggas, then act now
I show you how it's done, nigga, Gilla House
Give you a whole clip, turn your ruby glitter out, nigga "Walk on"


And beat ya feet up, I'm sick with these dice, so put ya g's up
Then back a lighter tree, about to get the energy up
I milk like double D cup, plus, I air it out just like a sneaker
Will win, and then "key" your car like Alicia
Yup, my Meth is off the meter, more Yankee caps than Derek Jeter
Try'nna catch me a diva, then I'mma catch and meet ya
Might spill a thong, but still a don, still got
Love, for my baby moms, we just don't get along, hold the fuck on "Walk on"


Allow me to reintroduce -- nah, I don't need it
If you ain't got it since '92, nigga, beat it
Hop in the 4 of ya 7, black two-seater
Pull out a hammer, big as a vacuum cleaner
Nigga, I roll heavy, bitch, I roll steady
Get that dough Reggie, me fall off, really?
You better ask who the best rapper in ya hood
And when you mimick me, muthafucka, do it good, nigga "Walk on"



* samples were not cleared for the official album release


Y'know? General, general! Word out...
Yeah...
Aiyyo man.. you poppin fuckers
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


It's just rules with beats - you clown niggas can't rule the streets
We set shop! Wu-Tang, we rule the East
Taking over the block!
"From the gate now!"
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
Aiyyo, it's just rules with beats - you clown niggas can't rule the streets
We set shop! Wu-Tang, we rule the East
Taking over the block, you can't fuck with the block!
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Aiyyo, I stay funky and piley, blue Excelero
They lookin for me, what the fuck you behind me for?
Stressing everything I breathe on
I'm from the boulevard where niggas get jacked and peed on
Whatever homey, we more lavish
I might sneak you in the crib, see my lasers and glasses
Try to get my come up on
Yo, and when you see me, you know I got my "come up" arm on
Cartier called me up, robbery here
We got your seed in the back of the Beemer starving
We like lion killers, catch me on stage with the gauge
In my right hand, grenade and this leather bomber
I scout money, you know we hungry and talk funny
Coughing out corner rappers, don't never walk up on me
I write with only insane Malkovich
My troops gave me money to clown with them, fuck it
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


My first gun was a .32, back before uh!
Graduated to the .38, maybe a nine
I prefer the fo' five, stay alive
Techs held the crack gank in '88
8 oz. straight from Florida, the best temp
Camouflage vest, repping the set
Wu on the east wing, twenty-ten, sexy bad
We up at Spain with that thing thing, my crew strong
We take no search for your party dunn, you know how I run
Spray places, cover faces, beat cases
A big mouth will get your teeth knocked the fuck out
Keep a nunchuk, take money, stay ninja
I injure, any motherfuckin contender
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Hey bitch, your time's up! Go finish them rhymes up
All my soldiers is lined up, my corners is crimed up
Niggas know where to find us, settin the grind up
Police checkin them pies up, my rims are shined up
Wu! We on the rise up, crops supplied up
Plottin niggas demise up, boxed in conduct
Scratch we got 'em sized up, and when the East is in the house
You, you, you, you, you...
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


On the side of the projects, grey skully, bubble 'Lo goose
Mac 11 tucked in front of the belly
Prestigious moves, we killin 'em, hoes we drillin 'em
We like George Foreman out in the streets, we grillin 'em
In the van, .45's and dilly's, ready to slam it
House arrest box is goin off, Tony got grams
Gotta bath tub full of white, lay in it like Sam Montana
Tune 'em out, to blow out, chop 'em like fans
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


This is boulevard hard, lounging in your black car
Camouflage rat guard on "Stomp the Yard"
I-N-S spit monster bars, flip long regards
My click dons bitch, y'all are frauds
I get it in like Tim off the glass
Slamming my name, I'm like the prez, sending men off to blast
What I spit, make 'em spend all their cash
I'm so Wu, so new that I ain't ripped off the tags
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


RZA done birthed us, some curse on purpose
I'm the grouch, my mouth is a circus
Burner plus a good learner, don't need a hood
All I need's a good burner, Nat Turner
Snake rat murderer, all I hear is turf talk
Rack rooms full of goons with bullet wound birthmarks
From the first spark, you heard my response
(Wu-Tang!) More results talkin 'bout whole crew's mission just lost
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Out the beehive, you dip and you dive
But you still can't survive, you can't see past five
Check the outlook, this is not in the book
You bein dragged across the floor while your 'dro in my hook
Lyrical joust, found all the deal off the books
Steve Rif gave the nod to Universal, good look
Still spit poison venom, Red Monkey and Wu dem
Have any dudes seen the condos? It's all 'em
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Put my +clan in da front+, +reunite+ 'em
Make 'em all R.S.V.P., if they want it, we don't invite 'em
No beef, less talk and more action
We parole as a whole, we'll send you back in fractions
Break through fanatic, low crates deep in attics
The Abbott pulled out a .45, looped with static
I scrolled through the menu then rolled to the venue
The dress code is armor all, put a hole up in him
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)




Ridin' dirty, got a Ruger in your lap
Black suit, 7:30, couple shooters from the trap
They done killed the homie brother
What you s'posed to do with that?
Who gon tell his baby mother that her dude aint coming back?
That kind of pain is hard to put into a rap
The block is hot and cant nobody move a pack
When you shooting on-site, you aim the Ruger at his naps
Cut his tongue, hog-tie him, things we usually do to rats
What? Who gassed you up and threw a match?
Dont want police to line you up and you a match
Fool them clowns into thinking you a snack
Brought a gun to wash it down and you can drink it through the tap
Thats my reaction, now react
Now try to picture Malcolm X without the strap
If Meth Man could navigate the globe without a map
I could beat the pussy up without a scratch

 (x2)
Time ticking teams quick to get ya
Im trying to bury about a trillion
Meth's Lab bitch catch us on ya
And when we coming, we be flowing likes its water


Im so ignorant, spend it before I make it
Pour salt on my food before I taste it
Pour salt in your wounds, right in the basement
All of us, statement, one vision, rich dreams
Couple scars, I heal quicker than Wolverine
Population, pink slips, quarter greens
Hood millionaires hide when the wolves out
Move with security, hold tight to your jewelry
Uh  thats my reaction, now react
Once your hood pass revoked, you never get it back
Benzes, Bentleys, nah nigga dont tempt me
Trust I got it on me, Imma squeeze till its empty
Lord forgive me, I need that new 550
With the cocaine seats, Im so street
And when the police came, we dont speak
From my hood to your hood, aint nothing sweet

 (x2)
Time ticking teams quick to get ya
Im trying to bury about a trillion
Meth's Lab bitch catch us on ya
And when we coming, we be flowing likes its water



 - Yeeeah yeah
 - Yeah yeah, word up, uh
 - Erick Sermon and Keith Murray
 - Representing that..
 - Kickin' it to the beat
 - New York, word up
 - E! E! E!


Respect my views on this day and era
Keep your eyes upon me, and not the sparrow of berettas
I'm fly, than any bird on this earth
For what it be, my style is butter like Worth
I freak the beat like I'm lost in the twilight
A zone with no phone, looking over parasites
I pack the house like Woodstock when I rock
A three day event of me dropping the illest shit
From here to New Jerz, back to Brooklyn and Queens
To Uptown to Bronx River, I still deliver
The off the wall for y'all
Rearranged cameo-type strange pumping through your veins
What your mommy do, if you're not ready to die like Biggie
I'ma keep jamming like Ziggy
I got the air waves wiped down like Funkmaster Flex
Sway and Tech, and Premier, and we in here


 It's on like that! And everybody's welcome!
 You are welcome



Now, it's on like that once again, it's getting hot
Now it's time to blow up the spot
For my niggas out there on the block getting money
Playas whose hustling, doing their thing
But me, I've lounged without the stone
Do it for my peeps, take it to the streets
All day, everyday, I sets the mood
Parabellum eye , with new attitudes
I change not for the words, but for the better
And be a trend-setter, and bring the best ever
Yeah, teach me for the president
So I can bring the vibes through your residence (E Double!)
The ghetto blast, the green eyed rapper slash producer
And O.J. with the juice, uh!
Y'all know me, it's the E-R-I-C-K
So enjoy the day, and peace to Marvin Gaye


 It's on like that! And everybody's welcome!
 You are welcome



Let's groove back and forth like Aaliyah
If you ain't got the vibe, then I wouldn't want to be ya (see ya)
I threw it like a rap attack from New York to Hackensack
Kiss myself and jump back, surprise like a Crackerjack
The eye can bring the smiles without Shanice
And make enemies call truce, or even peace
Funk Lord fights back
Again without the Force of Luke Sky, Chewbacca, R2D2 and the crew
The miracle worker (God praise him, praise him!)
All of them ready for the funk, you feel like you want like (blaaah!)
Whatever you requested, and you suggested
That I bring the pain like Method
It's nothing nice, cause I'm down for whatever
Me and my beretta, me and my beretta
Goddammit, don't leave your dog stranded
Who? Yeah, the Green Eyed Bandit


 It's on like that! And everybody's welcome!
 You are welcome




Hydro... indo... (buddha!)
Hah... cocoa... yo, ya-ya-yo!
I need some brown weed (lady) all day
I need some brown weed (jenny)
I need some cut (lady, lady)


Now these doors don't open, til after dark
And it ain't til 12 til the party really starts
(Yo, me and my crew had to be in by ten
Right before the fun was about to begin)
Yo yo, one bitten, jabberjaws, tryin to taste the
Paper written, kids be bullshittin, I see they flaws
Too many rebels, not enough cause for me to pause
Them broads love my shitty drawers, the finest
Criminal minded put my life behind it, you niggas
Find it hard to swallow poison in the bottle, she too sexy
So I gotta watch you fast bitches, too many tricks
That can give a dick a bad sickness *coughing*


Yo, yo! Yo son excuse me?
(Yo) I'm tryin to earn a million buck or two
The ill MC step in -- (and who the fuck are you?)
Doc start walkin bumpin M.O.P
To catch a nigga gettin gassed, puttin ten on three
(Da Ruckus!) With the mic I blast men on sight
So off the hook Atlantic Bell had to go on strike
Doc did it, metaphors come AMG kitted
20/20 vision, comes tinted! From being so high..
(So high..) so high.. so high..


Air it out
Iron Lung I be the street soldier, ante up
Pull them panties up, party's over, in the cut
Slappin grudges offa niggas shoulder, bringin ruck
Like them Wild-cats at Villanova, hot as fuck!
Duke or sober, swallow ebola, soul controller
Of the universe, stole-a, colder than polar
Caps grab your hoodie hat, Island of Stat'
Keep them cats runnin for they gat, in stormy weather


Gats, right hook, uppercut swollen how I left your eye
Stage dived, made a mistake, kicked F.O.I
Aiyyo ho! Doc be keepin a dope show like Marilyn
Manson the handgun be stashed in the panelling
Jersey drop son, watch me whip it like midget
Diggin in that whole plate and, piss on your picnic
(Don't nobody move) Don't nobody start flinchin
Limo driver, roll up the fuckin partition!


 Who them niggas that be rollin them thai, high as a kite?
Gettin pussy all nite (well all rite cha) yeah yeah
 Well who them cats you can call on, when you wanna brawl?
(Get drunk as hell) and so on (well all rite cha) yo yo

 Bricks to Stat' hold it down (well all rite cha) yo yo
 Mad dick up in your mouth (hah, all nite cha)


Yo Tical's and Doc, did it before, I'll do it again
Snatch spark to the ignition, I'm screwin it in
(Aiyyo we out!) Six drop in ten seconds, what?
I'll be the first one on the floor at your, wedding reception
B-Boys gather around and act p-noid
Bring the Trouble T-Roy, to earlobes, keyloid
(Terminator 2) Doc after Sarah Conn'
For the barrel bonds (Am I on?) Tical, you're on

Uhh-uhh-on, uhh-uhh-on
Uh uh-uh uh-uh, uh-uh-on


Got these slim pickins on my Charles Dickens, I pack a mac
To make your back stiffen, flip the script I act different
The oddball, keep your distance, warning y'all you don't listen
Bitchin over shit you ain't gettin
So finally, puttin in work, the big hurt
MC, with a social disease, and get it first
Enemies, feel my energies, four centuries of anger
Remember me? (The field nigga!)
Too Ghetto Fabulous, RZA.. Sharp, and hazardous
Figure, with bad habit, can't hold his liquor
Speed like a millipede (Hot Nix-on)
Contemplate the non-fiction on loose leaves
Paragraphs, hundred degrees, my pen bleed (ha!)
Showin you the pain I feel from holdin these
Black thoughts, deep rooted, nowadays
They come with batteries included, in wicked ways


 Who them niggas that be rollin them thai, high as a kite?
Gettin pussy all nite (well all rite cha) yeah yeah
 Well who them cats you can call on, when you wanna brawl?
(Get drunk as hell) and so on (well all rite cha) yo yo

 Bricks to Stat' hold it down (well all rite cha) yo yo
 Mad dick up in your mouth (all nite cha)

Cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha...
* fades in and out before end *




Yo, yo, P. Diddy might run this city
But I walk down the block, flash my -- (Yo RZA, hold up, hold up)
Yo what's up son? (Yo, we gotta remix this joint)
Yo, come on then (Yo, 40, it's on you)


I gotta tell you, we ain't next to nice, made you nice
Don't get your head cracked, don't get your tomato diced
I'm the coldest M.C. in the game
And I shouldn't have to say it, you squares know my name
Pimped with all the slang in the game, that they recite
Every time I open mouth, these suckas bite
I bust like a Dutch Master, blast you if a have to
Somebody call the pastor


We got realest long beats
Flows stop, make the beat go ---
I'm in the Coup with the seats low
Even on the East Coast, I gotta keep my heat close
We leaving holes in your cheap clothes
My only job is to stop imposters, watch the mobster
Cop the Boxster, drop the top and squat
Switchin' through lanes, this is the group thing
Cause this is Wu-Tang and Horseshoe Gang, what up?


We pop, we brawl, get money till the day we fall {please believe it}
(We pop, we brawl, gettin' money til the day we fall) {please believe it}


Yo, I Bonecrush' ya, like I ain't 'never scared' brother
That baby mother's like baby powder and there another
M.C. does this cutter, when I cut, I split jugglers
When my teeth get yellow, I spit butter
By now you know my name, man, who hold the belt, now
Plus who hold his self down, all with the same hand
Now what's the game plan, let money change hand
I'm still champ, and white boys still can't hang


Yo, P. Diddy, might run this city
But I walk down the block, flash my Glock on the jiggies
An ounce of chronic, crushed up in the ziplock
Outside the club, is packed up to the gridlock
Dime piece wizes, high heels and the flip flops
Real players pop with those cringy wrist watch
Big bouncers the size of Sasquath
Tuck riff with the rim that'll make your eyes pop




Do I have to assassinate them?
Man, I leave 'em with no altimatum
I ain't hate 'em, I ain't make 'em make mistakes
But I'mma break 'em, the cops, could I shake 'em
Or will they catch me and charge me
On the streets I put something in ya, that'll send you to God
Meet my man, we don't have to roll, candy when we ride
She love it, when I give her, pull her panties to the side
Bullet loco, you might catch me breaking and entering
Mama, I had to jump bail right before the sentencing


Get it up in 'em, cool, that strip and claimin' the set
And quick to Sway the Tech, ya'll straight bang and connect
It's the dog, ya'll get it off, on your backpack and blue marker
Chronic smoke cougher, I don't shoot walker
Dub Sizzle on the remix, the last to speak
Now it's all coming together like sweaty gas leaks
Fo' sure, a nigga will say, 'yo, it's Dub C'
40, Crooked I, RZA, Method Man and Jayo

Girlfriend don't get it wrong
I hate to be the one to shit on your lawn
But I ain't got my dog license I ain't nothing nice
And I ain't never met a piece of pussy I ain't liking
Sugar and spicing
Kicked up with ice and
You can do anything with these hoes
Except housewife them
Like snoop said "it ain't nothing but a G thing"
Got a bitch in my bed, in nothing but a g-string, so peep game
Who the lucky female to taste these
Snips and snails and puppy dog tails huh?
You're messing with me, I'm messing with you

Find where you live at, shit on your porch, Redman is hungry
Don't leave the food out, I'm pumped like a Pamela Anderson boob job
Straight up bulldog, mixed with a Shizhsu
Cause I bullshit, party a little bit
Swim with the shark, you're bound to drown
My weed is like green, and yours brown
The doctor the dog, from Cali to Georgia
When cats meow with noting on top they halter
I don't have Yesmen that laugh when I laugh
We some dogs, we can kiss our own ass
Like a golden retriever, retrieving the chronic
The dose nose bitch, and no need to hide it - Redman a flirt
Always get my nuts stuck to the porch, like the dog on Joe Dirt

We just some dogs, we just some dogs


Fish don't fry in the kitchen, bitch don't climb, keep bitching
Beans don't burn on the grill, 3, 4, 5
With the pimping, hoes get your pimps permission
Now pay attention, the big D-O double to the G-O
To the liquor store to crack a ho and get some VO (VO)
And mix it with some pena colidino
Then slip it on the bitch then I dip with all her c-notes
Scandalous, yep bitch cause we know
Every pretty ho always down to pull a d-low
On me? No, so there won't be no shaking me down, breaking me down, here we go
You know I'm just oh so slick
The way you chew that bubble gum, the way you sucking a dick
And I can tell, that you a freak
I wanna stick some dick up in you can I skeet, skeet
Don't you know why?

When my dogs gettin' high gettin' rich, haaaan
And a nigga rich, haaaan


Shame on a nigga who tried to run game on a nigga
Pull a pistol, bang on a nigga
Beamer on the Boulevard, everybody know it's me
Bordeaux Polo, smoke a ton of weed
No room for nonsense, you under new ownership
Pullin' niggas' cards, givin' shooters bonuses
Fuck the rumors, now I'm standin' in a room with ya
Face, gut, buck 50, got two pistols
We the Knights of the Templar
Born dopeboy, oh, I should've been stopped
Def Jam see me as a threat now
Hundred mill, any less is a let down


This is it, boy
Stackin' money to the sky, gettin' rich, haaaan
Stackin' bricks to the sky, this is it, haaaan
When my dogs gettin' high gettin' rich, haaaan
And a nigga rich, haaaan


Full magazine, bitch, shoot for the stars
Snatch a nigga chain just to post it on the blog
Assassinate a name, nigga sprayin' in the dark
Hate you with a passion, but he askin' for a job
Shame on a nigga that tried to run game on a nigga
Pull a pistol, bang on a nigga
Gettin' money while them other boys bitter
I'm an artist and my niggas are the realest
What a shame pussy niggas wear glitter
Put to sleep by the pillowcase killer
Black Benz, black weed, black bottle, nigga
Rich, dirty niggas still mobbin', nigga


This is it, boy
Stackin' money to the sky, gettin' rich, haaaan
Stackin' bricks to the sky, this is it, haaaan

I say
I can give it to you but whatcha gon do wit it
I can give it to you but whatcha gon do
I can give it to you but whatcha gon do wit it
I can give it to you but wha-wha wha-wha whaaat


I can give it to ya but whatcha gonna do wit it
When I'm in Texas I'm bumpin' screw music
With Big Mike and Scarface with Luke Loop
Me and lil' Crook like Bo and Luke Duke
When I'm in Miami I go to scoop Luke
To see the peep show and hit some duke shoot
Went to Branson, back to back, Lex Coupe
Up in "Harlem World" in my Timb boots
Two suckers had beef so I watched them shoot
Called up Benny Rat, copped a bullet proof
Seen T-Funk he took us to the fruit
Then he went to the Tunnel and brought down the roof
Mink coats and moet, bitches drippin' sweat
Slang a cassette to Funkmaster Flex
And now I'm bumpin' on East Coast tapedecks
Went from Swatch to platinum Rolex
S.D., Jersey we getting more sex, flow next, go next




I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' hood, hood
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' low ridahh (2x)


If my niggas can't eat then y'all niggas can't sleep
I just begun to creep, Nightmares on Elm Street
Release from Jones Beach to South Beach, capisce?
Kickin' dust as I bust, fuck peace
And all them crooked cops on the beat
My niggas bring the funk like your Grandpa feet
'Til death do us part, save my bullets for the charts
With darts, like HBO watching after dark
No love for a mark, even less for a trick
That wanna be like Mike, Mike who? My dick
Real shit Hot Nicks
Run wit my niggas that ain't got shit
Pop shit, and peddle poetry for profit
One time, out for mine, but can't stop it
Trying to keep they hands in my pocket
So I bring obnoxious, infected lah that be toxic
Leave the crime scene spotless
Mix the green with the chocolate, here's the topic
Niggas, synchronize your watches
We goin in, wit nothin' but a Clan logo
Mr. meth, (DMX!) I'm running loco motherfucker






I got a wicked flow and I'm gonna kick it yo, feel the pressure
Snatching niggas up just like change off the dresser
Niggas hit me with they best shit, then what
I shake that bullshit off *arf arf arf* then go nuts
Ive been down too long, can't a motherfucker show me nothing
Y'all bitch niggas is duckin' me like you owe me something
I got more homies than an esse, but lets say
I couldn't talk you wouldn't walk my way on your best day
The best way you can hope to get close to me
Is right here under my wing like you're supposed to be
The first time you start acting fuckin' strange
Best to be ducking range
Talkin' shit wearing a fuckin' chain
I break niggas like promises
Split em' open like Thomas's
And sell more drugs than a pharmacist
Strapped wit nothing but a rhyme a long history of violent crime
Attitude that doesn't mind doing time










Microphone check, one, two

From this bomb weed, I cop from the streets
Get you open like buttcheeks, from girls who be freaks
Ayo, can I be SWV? You the One nigga
Rap Shogun, yes E the one
Yo, I'm rolling with a forty pack of niggas
Get my weed from Branson cause his sack's bigger, yo give me dap nigga

Ferocious causing comatoses to collapse
So chinky eyed I see people waving on a map
I make it hotter than your thermostats
Bomb MC's with rough megahertz so call me
Funk Doctor verbal starburst, lyrical expert
Your boombox better form a union
Cause I leave your circuits overworked, word bond
Niggas front like they want it
But I be in the five hundred with E steadily getting blunted
Damn nigga you cool at what you spitting
So why you holding the blunt so long politicking
Huh, I ace them blunts with the technician of electrician
I don't got a pot to piss in but still spend my last on hydroglycerin
I keep it live no jive rolling Dutches
That's Masters like the Furious Five
I, keep your crew chinky eyed, for bitches actin dog
(Can you hit it from the back?) Why not, while we toke on this

I smoked with a lot of college students
Most of 'em wasn't graduating and they knew it
You know the weed slang? Yeah boy I speak it fluent
I light your college dorm with my entourage from Newark
Bigger they come, harder they fall
That goes for, knuckleheads MCs, pussy walls and all
I lit my first L before I started to crawl
I got my ass whupped when I had my first brawl
But things changed since I was twelve years old
I specialize in wreckin mics and area codes
Now, PPP the kinda niggas that'll bug with ya
Smoke bud with ya, later on stick a slug in ya
Everything that's light green ain't the bomb bitch
I got different forms to make you lose your calm bitch
Read my lips, you ain't hitting unless you got
Ten on it, get on it, or get the fuck out my cypher


(I can feel it)
You ready to roll this weed up? (Whateva man)
You ready to rob this nigga? (Whateva man)
(I can feel it)
You ready to fuck bitch? (Whateva man)
You ready to guzzle this liquor? (Whateva man)
(I can feel it)

I'm noddin' on beat, I'm mobbin' on streets, the method
Be starvin' to eat, cigar in my cheek, forget it

Meth: And if it ain't that Keith what could it be?

Bit wit the rap bug caught the influenza
Lyrically I'll air you out, Meth clear you out
You like a mistake when I'm writin' gotta smear you out
I go ballistic on second thought I give you a break
Cut you into little pieces and mail you to every state


We off the meter off the block or straight off the street
We in your party like when pit bulls of the leash
Yes, when Meths wit the Legion of Doom
Pack your shit up your life will be leavin' you soon
Picture big dick daddy in a big sick caddy
My ho even sicker wit a big thick fatty
Lord! Somebody pinch me this can't be real
I'm ill like action flick stars that can't be killed


And I ain't never met a sucker and we got a long
I ain't never smoked no blunt that wasn't too strong
We been D4L before D4L
Rock wit the Funk Doc shut down the whole jail
When Plus got killed L.O. rushed the courthouse
I'll smack that talk back in your mouth
The L.O.D's in here, the Killa Beez in here
If you ain't gettin' rowdy you shouldn't be in here


Meth: And it was what it is when it was when it wasn't
And if it ain't that Grand what could it be?

Meth: Keith what could it be?

Niggas is like "Oh my God not you!"
Yes I'm in the flesh like hollow heads through your vest
No contest, M.E.-Eth Man's obsessed
With sex, drugs and rock and roll, new Tecs and calicos
Word has it we move mathematic on rappers
Who don't add up, you get broke, battered and slapped up
8 million stories in the nekkid call yo man Method
Straight guerrilla iller nigga kill a murder record
My verbal shooter does it to ya
The 16-bar Ruger, busting yo funky dope maneuvers
But I'm not ya Super Lover Cee, I'm the Super Sperm
Splash it on your skin rub it in like it's Lubriderm
10 out of 10 I'll be the, men of all men I mean the
Creme de la creme a schemer, sipping on 'Gnac and Zima
True Professional too(two)(DJ Cluee!)
Now that Bush is president nigga we all through


It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
Why I keep on ducking under the bed when I hear thunder
Cause I ain't crazy, I say shit that's crazy to crazy people
To make 'em believe I'm crazy so they can relate to me
And maybe believe in Shady so they can be evil baby
I like that! I'm only as crazy as people made me
Believe me, they'd be just as many mutherfucking murderers
And heroin users without Marilyn's music
But I figure I make my music I don't care if you use it
To murder somebody, I just wanna be there when you do it
Now the parents are suing cause little Darren is screwing
Karen and Susan cause I told him to do it on Clue's new shit
Now it's all ruined, the whole world is fucked up
Cause of me? Two 12-year old girls is knocked up
My attitude's 'fuck it' like Pac's was at one point
Wanna come join? Pick up a Glock and just point
Now everybody's killing everybody and everybody's bloody
And I'm just laughing like it's funny
Cause I don't really give a shit about no-motherfucking-body
I'm so motherfucking nutty, I don't give a fuck about nothing


My wrist is water and freezer mix, this is
Audio Jesus the repent shit gets big
Keep a sharp-like knife in a pop device
So "Duro you gotta let it bump!", I came from a hard knock life
They say this kid be rude like this can't be true
I'll suck my own dick like if I had a rib removed
Vampire, sun go down, I'm still wilding
Bullets travel through the air in the night like Phil Collins
Rock City baby, knife through your throat 'til you're broke
Rise from the underground like sewer smoke
It's all shifty, I got all of my dogs with me
And they all rich, and still all of their palms itchy
We'll pump, rumble over birds jungle urge
Walking like we talking drunk while we stumble over words
Clue, Duro, Slim, Meth, Five, Nine, hold up, breath


It's just, Mr. Meth and DJ Clue
I ain't crazy, I just do what the beats say do


It's just, Slim Shady and DJ Clue
I ain't evil, I just do what the beats say do


Uhh, uhh, Royce Five-Nine and DJ Clue
I ain't bad, I just do what the beats say do


DJ Clue, Desert Storm
Come on man

.. {*jail interlude*} ..


Son I just slapped my bitch
Came to my crib 'bout half past six
Kid's in shitty diapers, no food was fixed
I was like, "Yo bitch - why ain't no food fixed?"
She on the phone with her friend talkin bout dick
I snatched the receiver from that bitch like CLICK
She got all excited, tryin to throw fit
Swung at me then I swung back - BITCH!


What you in fo'? It happened in the club
With some thugs I was at the bar, smokin bud, hollerin at love
Ladybug was playin in my peachfuzz, she was
Talkin hot fudge, can't nobody do it like she does
In the hot tub - didn't know her man was in the club
And honey dove never mentioned that she had a scrub
It must have been the drugs or the alcohol buzz, had me
Shootin my game like a thirty-eight snub baby
Let's cut a rug, that's when I felt a shove
What the blood, dude actin like he won the Golden Gloves
I get one for holdin grudge, but if this kid throw a slug
I'mma throw a slug - that's how we be rollin cuz
I see this dud tryin to play me like a pair of Lugz
Big John Stud, Goldschlager in a golden mug
What you in fo'?

.. {*jail interlude*} ..


I'm locked down for tryin to hold my block down since a shorty
The Old Earth was like, "Street put the Glock down"
I was raised in slums, love how the gun sounds
And now I got one - c'mon, who wanna front now?
Sunup to sundown, ready for showdown
Whoever wanna throw down, the gangsters better slow down
Wake up, before you be in a cell with forty of us
(What you in fo'?) In for murder over money love and lust
(What you in fo'?) In for life, don't let me tell you twice
I might bang you twice and take double the life
What you in fo'?


Jail status - get up
Wash a nigga mattress faggot, you heard about me right?
Pass off them packages cat, you gotta eat to live
Meet the crib; got a hundred starvin niggas in here big
So pop off, drugs that's props, bring in
Glocks we call 'em oxes
Be a real live nigga, swing mops and shit, take over shit
Fuck the C.O.'s, aiyyo Boo, I need clothes
Slide brokers where phones get hid
Fuck with Russians and Latins
The most powerful marble black slipper style
Goin out thrashin niggas, kicks get thrown
Big sizes, sleep in your boots, 4000 rugged F Troops
Notarized wigs, lay six months
That's alright dog, make it home Lord
Heard you admit it in the box, slid it under walls
Bang monster anger
Bop through the halls with bangers
Live God like the Abbot of all chambers..

.. {*jail interlude*} ..



* originally the "Box in Hand (Remix)" from the Box in Hand 12"


Yeah, assorted flavor Clarks
No doubt
The beer champ
Yeah, curly head kid
Yo, yo, yo

From Gators to blazers, low fades and razors
Big dick saloon, I contact the womb; the black asian
Which location keeps circulating
My wonder twin power activate - shit on this nation
Allah seen represent the gummy with the green
Who walk mean stand up on your block and burn a bean
Sir Ballentine, lookin at that bitch wide behind
The thing that's fuckin up a girl is that swine
Then turn around take my last pull off the L
These niggas on the block keep looking at me well
But they want the jewel it ain't hard to tell
I recognize his face, he actin like Denzel
But fuck him, I went to check low for chop
On a ball gone the size like faith up top
Now it's a whole new ball game, strategic mind frame
My dialogue's rebellious raid and razor fame
Glass out a red light, see Killah get on a ninja bike
Show my love to the God he peeled out and made a right
{*Sound of speeding motorcycle*}


When you walking down the street with your - Box in your hand
And you bringing the music of the - Wu-Tang Clan
And you hear Ironman on your - radio rapping
Your feet start the dancing and your - hands start the clapping


Street's running through your dancehall gunning
Like Lee Harvey Oswald stunning slapping MC's with summons
For pumping - that watered down substance
Beef there's slugs finger creeping
Making moves like Crying Freeman
Prince of thieves, earth's third seed
Heavyweight like golden fleeces homicides stroll the street
In Blue Caprices, look at the thugs holding heat
In the city beef got me plotting trilogy
To the smoke enemies sneak attacks I'm beyond and above that
Seen that done that, respect black
I catch a slug to your hardhat
Lounging in the everglades, surfing the airwave
Catch a buck fifty where the razorblades swiftly
Shaolin cats be shiesty, strictly
Drunk off the Irish whiskey




Rest your headpiece on this one son
Cough up a lung
Sleeping on my murderous type ones I get you done
I'm looking at these cuthroat kids and how they live
It's like we was partners in spades and you renege
Can't fuck with no nigga like that he get me jack
Or sent back, meaning whole life fade to black
I'm looking in the half of right and roll tight
Fool me once but can't fool me twice, I'm 25
To life on this mic device I'm nothing nice
A mixture of long wild rice and no spice
Inflicted, rap addicted, track I stick it, flip it
Daddy long dick-ed, slide
A little bit beyond twisted, mind in stitches
You thought weak but meant wicked
Niggas choke off my second hand smoke lifted
Everyday is like my birthday I'm mad gifted, dead calm
Hit me with the eighteen bronze, buddah palm
About to blow like Napalm, before your arm
Prepare for the warfare, or buy a share
Oh what the fuck we dealing with, yeah
Johnny about to go there
Need another year
Bust a shot for my sons that didn't make it here

You look my all, but you jaw folks be forward
We from the same zone, but you wanna cause war
Then Bad Mentalz mold to make match things upon this mission
So I drink the booze, so I block out all restriction
Now I am prepared for these hazardous conditions
So brothers will be scared, but in my past, there's no pissin'
Genoese, I'm feelin' this, I'm illin' this, forever
Forever, just out as long as these niggas ain't never pull my lever
Figurin', rush triggerin' this nigga and, conditionin' of the mental slang
You become legendary for the men you bury
So I work with this, I just be merciless just like a mercy man
Just comin' with a spark, perpetrated heart, damn if he do
(Trends though he the rule)
But let's begin to ruffle, Trends setter huddle
No way that my neck'll buckle in the scuffle, yo let's shuffle
Let's hook to the dome of a cut, yo, what's up
Swagger as you stagger, I bust you like a neck flexed out
And watch the wreck come trickle in
Adrenaline, come any men, cause it's my temple that you ticklin'
Mad rows, bad blows surfin' through the shadows
That can't go, the test stress of your chest, your back blows
This cover, this mother, this and another, because your back wasn't covered


Me, nothin' I hate more than a fake and phony ass nigga
In my square, prepare for the nation, if I slam, like my culture
Old jet style and get bit by the vulture
Scavenger, take anyone on the calendar
In the back, you can be the champ, I'll be challenger
From the underground, understand, I'm the underdog
That one and all, some hungrier than ya'll
Water down bastard, style's not long from the casket
36 Chambers of death, kid, to let it
Now they goin', oh hey, except it
Come here with the childish shit, you get molested
I got the anger of a slave man
Usin' my change to bring pain, to the cave man
Dig it, it's the, I ain't got no love for the nigga on the trigga
With my name on a slug, now ask yourself


Who got my back, who got my back? (Naught got your back)
Who got my back, who got my back? (Ill Town got your back)
Who got my back, who got my back? (North Carolina got your back)
Who got my back, who got my back? (Virginia got your back)


Blaow, cli-clao, cli-clao, how you like me now
Blaow, cli-clao, cli-clao, guard your lips, funk that
Who see my back, who be my back, who rockin' that?
Who got my back, like that, a gat
Looks like a pump, feels like a sneaker
Even deeper a reaper ain't scared of a weaker creeper either
It ain't no mystery, you played your history like a hoochie
Now we see where Miss Goldberg is a Whoopie
White face, black paint, didn't get me dancin'
White men can't jump, and I bet you ten can't dance, son
Fuck what you heard, just act like you listen
Any mission caught dissin', listen, I'm pissin' on your system
Then I'm playin' Mr. Split You, with your sister
Fuck stick and move, bitch I'm slick, I stick and blister
Then I sliver through your liver, quiver, shake an earthquake
The style shaker, that make you wet the faker
To tell 'em I'm yellin', cause I'm strapped, I'm mad at the world
Drinkin' earl, heard shots, who got my back


A mastermind takes dimes to create
And if you're not experienced, you best contend with your own weak class
Word to my granny's ass, my range is strange
Enter, box ripper, to the center
Here I am, so what, this nigga's style is what
I throw a brick from the lip, when I'm in the cut
Always representin', cause the men, done white
Hittin' the uptown slick nigga, shit through the night
Cause I hate when other niggas list it, check this, kissed it
Never had to diss it, call me swinger man
I maintain my rap, get my dap and I step through the rubble
Lookin' for trouble, muthafuckas here it is, grown in your biz
I put your all in here, I'm sayin' flows for days
Where the big boys be playin'
Mad styles from mad files, see, Trend-men
Wreck shit from miles and mile and miles
I dedicate my skill to the sewers
I dedicate my skill to those who walk through the manure
Forgot a, whose in the butter, here we are
Call us Trend-men, we come and make muthafuckin' masada
Who got my back in the mist of the mayhem
When I attack 'em, Brother Nast' out to slay 'em


Yeah, word up, peace out the gutter
Who dat? D-Ski, Lord Champ, Trends State, Riker's Island
All will, North County
(Wow, Meth Tical, power cypher got my back
The whole Shaolin Island got my back
Yeah, even Long Island got my back, and I'm out)
{Word up, word up, Brother Nast', Uptown
Represent niggas, in Brooklyn, in Bronx, all ya'll niggas
Get live with us, Trends of Culture, who got my back?}




You know it, just like before, muthafucka
It ain't never went no where, we still drink forties
Still got niggas that'll whip that ass for me, come on
The real way... yeah... another Rockwilder joint
Up in your muthafuckin' mouth, nigga...
Come on... put my fucking dicks in they mouth
I ain't playing with ya'll niggas, come on, come on
Come on, God damn, hit with the... with my what?
God damn, with the what? Huh, muthafucka, mutha -- yo, yo


I'm anti-everything, ya'll niggas is for
Eat up everything on my plate, then eat yours
Ain't got no table manners, I disrespect the law
Off that 99 bananas, disconnect a jaw
Throw your muthafucking hands up, never comb my hair
Never pull my pants up, I keep it cracking
For the whole borough of Staten
Got to keep it ugly bloody and a terry napkin
Catch me on the 14th of February, actng
Like I got no love for this whole world, smashing
Anybody asking, no questions, and answer
Pop another ecst' for the extravaganza
Bong bong, can't nobody fuck around with John John
Take you rappers on and your man with them pom-pom
From Vietnam, from the phenom, forever mo', back like before
You see my Clan, see my M.O


Who I'm is, at your crib, with his bad ass kids
Who I'm is, fuck ya'll nigs, we get down like this
Who I'm is, the phenom, them niggas can't live
Who I'm is, we ain't got shit, something got to give
Watch ya step, kid (huh), watch ya step, kid (muthafucka)
Watch ya step, kid, watch ya step, kid (come on)
Watch ya step, kid (yeah yeah), watch ya step, kid (yo yo)
Watch ya step, kid, watch ya step, kid (cook a bag of 'dro)


My middle name Mud, dirty water flow
Leave a ring around the tub, grimy mothafuck
Kid, I don't give a what, if you feel like I feel
Throw that third finger up to the sky like such
Follow this, funky like some staircase piss
Take a wish, breeze you when your track run sniff
Off the snow, that's the only way I can grow
We them kids in the back, yelling "wack", at the show
Looky here, I'm steppin' to the game, like it's my rookie year
Home court advantage, two blunts, one beer
Beware, I'm from a place, where
They pop for that CREAM and that bling bling, yeah
Jimmy Crack Corn and I don't mothafucking care
So react like I'm strapped, keep your hands in the air
Pain is the game, and it's full contact
I ain't got to say my name, let the whole world ask




Ayo, Rockwilder, this beat is off the dog collar
Hit Ja Rule at E-46, tell him to holla
At your nigga, murderous flow that I deliver
Consider this M.C.'s last chance to reconsider
Their future, cuz ain't no future in fronting
My crew need something cuz we ain't used to nothing
The hardest M.C.'s rock the hardest production
Dick stay hard all day like when we fucking
Meth with the F.C., my disk's in the decks
Like the clip in the tech, and we risking your neck
If you fixing to flex, come in, pour out some liquor
For your dead homey, ya'll still acting like ya'll know me






Uh... what's really good?
Yo, yo, yo..


It's the unstoppable, over come any obstacle
Ya'll know my flavor, pack more punch than Tropical
Any mission possible, do what I gots to do
Labels gettin' butterfingers, and next they droppin' you
You think you know, but you have no idea
The Diary of a Meth Man, what's this I hear?
Somebody told ya'll, steppin' in shit was good luck?
I got the hood stuck, chh-chh, now give the goods up
Ya'll done pushed up, past the point of no return
It's Meth's turn, so roll that shit up and let's burn
I heard Philly got the best 'scherm, out in Cali, they got the best perms
Now that we know, when will the rest learn?
Come on, each one, teach one, hear no evil, and I don't speak none
Everything cool until that heat come
Just call my name, and I'll be there
Ya'll kids is slum, like the jewelry in Albi Square


We drinkin' Henny til we flip, poppin' bottles til we sick
All ya'll haters eat a dick (yeah, uh)
Let's throw a party in this bitch, all my niggas and my chicks
Tell me who ya'll rollin' with (yeah)


Method spits fire (Fire!) The roof's on (Fire!) My crew's on (Fire!)


M-E-T, H-O-D..


Man, I'm in the house like foreclosures
Talk sober, until some dog gets forced over
New York soldiers, be at ease, fall back
Never ever, I'm the New Era, like ball caps
Kid, whenever, whoever, whatever, ya'll want it
Ya'll can have it, the problem and answer, I'm all that
While we at it, let's tighten up our grips around that cabbage
Silly rabbit, how many kid's done tricked you on your carrots
The product of a bad package, like Bishop Don Juan it's Magic
How I break 'em like a bad habit, hit tracks like it's target practice
Then let these darts take a stab at it
Niggas ain't got it, ain't never had it
I jam like L.A. traffic, Jellyroll behind the wheel
And the passenger seat behind the field
It's your boy, physically fit, mentally sick
Get dirty money, told you honey, I'm filthy rich






Yeah, ya'll niggas don't know it's a game
Until it starts again, let's do it, haha!


Six minutes, Method Man, you're on
If you thinkin' you gon' slip and be alright, you're wrong
You can see me lightin' the bong, while writin' the songs
That the crowd, is either singin' to or fightin' along, fightin' along
I'm try'nna tell you drugs is not your friends
And girlfriend, don't try and front like you got your friend
I'm at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
And my chick's a man-eater, she be swallowin' men
Aight, live from New York, it's Saturday night
I got pipes that drain your confidence, and battery light
Aight, mami tight, but she ain't really my type
If ya'll don't see me treat her right, then she ain't really my wife
When I was young, I was stayin' in school, obeyin' rules
Play with my food, what makes you think I'm playin' with you?
This is it, ya'll better come on in, the water's fine
Jump on in, let's do it to 'em one more 'gain








Yeah, Ladies Love Big John Studd
No doubt, dick up in your mouth
We do this shit everyday, I'm in the cut
With my main shit stain, Ray-Ray Gutter Butt
And we holdin' it down for the whole Staten Island, man
Nothin' else but Staten Island, man
Ya'll stand up, man, Stapleton, the Wild West, Park Hill
Port Richmond, Now Born, Jungle Nilz, hah... Peace!

Yo, yo, yo

Bird catch it highed up til his eyes crossed
Fat belly, tall boy loungin with his socks off
No tan, toe jam like Roseanne
Got guns so big I bust with both hands
Pull 9 M-M's and tecs that don't jam
Mad family and friends in the drug program

Wrapped around a hot nickelodeon
Oh seven one three oh four thats the code we in
School of hard knocks here we go again


Yeah, yeah, yeah
Aiyyo Hot Nicks you got me noddin of the doses
While the Outs burn bush like God talkin to Moses
They mad I push the F1 with three front seats
Rock fatter chains than slave workers had on they feet
Smoke blunts til my breath smell, hop on my Nextel
Chick from West L bang her head against the bed rail
Ya'll betta leave 'fore Zee get evil
I'll tell you a secret, I see dead people


Aiyyo, aiyyo Pace
The Doc sports timbs with no lace
I come in her mouth and it look like colgate
I'm a gorilla, chewin on bananas
Psycho Im the one that blew my head in ?scanners?
BRICKS, lyrics and guns gotta stay smokin
Even Live to L.A. don't leave the gate open
I carry two shotties and I'mma squeeze both'um
And when I'm done me and ya bitch elopin

Hook:

 Y'all know, this how its suppose to be
And Y'all know
 Think of me 'fore you smoke them trees
 And Y'all know
 Wack raps make me choke emcees

 Pacewon from the O-U-T

Mista Meth, Wu-Tang Killer Bee


Aiyyo presto outta box
Tap you white folks outta locks
Take the shotguns out the grandfather clocks
Planets that I rock you can't astronaut
My house was on Afrika Bambattas block
Aiyyo my candy is prepared for manhandlin
The click from jammin avalanched the grand canyon
Thats how big it is, how large it is
Pitbull bite ??? through it ???


Yeah
Tryin to scare Zee and Funk Doc y'all playin
If this Scary Movie, you the fag like Shawn Wayans
I pop a lot, I pop shit I pop guns

Yeah rock box I loot Elle and run
Rock the Bells mix it with Duke Ellington

Hard headed dick gotta pussy fetish
Get'cha cosmetic, Meth at it call a medic
And while we said it
These niggas wanna catch amnesia and like forget it
The Outsidaz and y'all can call me Bony Boy
Or Rockwilder when we Face Off like Castor Troy
Creep with me as I roll through the stack
Maniac, lunatic and my whole click packed


Aiyyo Doc
I be spaced like Star Wars
Hardcore nigga don't lock my car doors
I rock shells toes backspin on cardboard
Gazelle type frames, wave caps, and four-fours
Graffiti to place leave my tag Pace Blunta
The barrel of my Glock stay hot like late summer
You freckle motherfuckas need shade to lay under
JAKE HUNTER, look but don't bite I take cover

Hook x2






Yo! You ready?


So we ball and pop champagne and waste it
See I've never been a drinker but a nigga tastin'
But I'm fine, fly guy dressed to take shit
And these ladies wanna be taken
In my mind, all I see is dollars and lace when
This bad chick just started waving
The crowd parted as I make my way, and
I said, "hey little mama, come live for a day"


She said: "Excuse me cutie, I'm in love with your ways
The more you come around the more I want just a day
The way you looking got me wanting to play
Where are you from? So tell me, where do you stay?"


(In the land of the wild things)
You see them killas from the slum
If they feelin' froggy, sleep, we kill em from the jump
Its a... (wild thing)
You see the shotty with the pump
The black Maserati with the body in the trunk
(In the land of the wild things)
Your blessings, better count that twice
Come on little money, you ain't bout that life
Its a... (its a wild thing)
You know we gotta style on em, right?
My wolves and a full moon, we wild for the night!


Come along, I'll tell you a story of greatness
A young nigga born, being sacred
From the town where when niggas were frowned on and hating
By the clown and pussy niggas scared to say shit
All the while, the kid sat around and waited
Writing rhymes, singing every cadence
A couple niggas thought he never make it
I guess them hating ass niggas never knew what fate is



I come from the crime side, the New York Times side
S.I., Til I D.I.E, I grew up hearing that Wu knock
Watchin' them guns cock back
Jet black, you feel like Hercules
Hercules, hercules; Get a hand clap
Damn that, Nevy got me covered like Saran Wrap
My whole hood jumping now, guess I did that
While these ladies wanna covet on my ballsack
Lightskin brother, smooth like butter
Coming from the city where most blocks were Summer
In the hood, we believed there was no need for change
Cause we believed that change ain't got shit on C.R.E.A.M
But I came to bring the pain, hardcore from the brain
With a 1 1/2 against the grain
Pop's shop popping only means one thing
Shoalin's back again!




Welcome to Staten fuckin' Island, scrappy
This the bottom, the dirt, ratchet shit
Ain't nothing but goons out here, fuckboy
Now is you a wolf, or is you a sheep?
I got your Ghetto Metrocard right here nigga, if you wanna ride
Stapleton, the Wild West, Homicide Houses
New Brighton, Arlington, The Harbor
You know who you fuckin' with?



 + (samples)
(Make me yours) He get out of line, break his fucking arm...
You know how it go (What am I supposed to say? Yeeaaah)
You know, word up, not playing the games, with these niggas, man
(Somebody tell me what do I do...)
None at all, man... hit 'em off, none of that, man


Aiyo, jump out the Acura, crazy heavy, what's popping?
Us locking the game, word to every hand on the locman
Street gwop, everybody eats, sweep blocks
This is a message, ain't go no grams, we gon' beatbox
Study like lessons, niggas in the game biting the grain
You knowing where it came from, stop it
You thought we wasn't coming? You dumbing, you blunted again
Watch Lex get that dough out ya pocket, rhyme all 'pallegic
Can't nothing move when I rhyme, when I drop lines it's law out in Egypt
Love ups, don't need no batteries now, what?
The only niggas that'll glow'll be us
Yo, throw me in Sin City, leave me with the vultures and bats
Then give me two weeks to bubble like Kim titties
Dirt Dog, we miss you, now it's time to murder the game
Cuz if things change, you know it ain't against Wu


What am I supposed to say? Yeeaaah
Somebody tell me what do I do...


We keep it hot, keep the heat on the block
We never stop, drawing water up until it begin to drop
Raining with the patchwork of puzzles
That was written in the year of the dragon
More raw than you could ever imagine
How much of a great blessing to a rap city
Where the youth is organically fed, from the Witty
Unpredictable, Talent And Natural Game is lyrical
Analyze the picture, the portrait, the visual
A Cuban Link Chef cooks spaghetti that's untied
RAGU nigga whose tomatoes are sundried
He gave y'all niggas whiplash from bling bling
But my rhyme'll give ya hot flash and moodswings
Math shed light on divine secrets, then science leaked it
For the lower level creatures that can't peep it
I observe MC's, regardless
From a neighboring world which is ten times the sharpness...




Let the track wind and ya mind flow free
Remain conscious on this ride to ya best ability
Infinity, back to the source of which it came
Energy, see it change forms, atoms being born, never ending
On and on and on and, travel with me
Not trying to convince the pack, that it's a fact
For those who can't adapt, I lived it, shitted it back
We have agreed, you'll feel the impact of the truth when I'll squeeze
The brain feels something pop, hip hop, locked in texts
Fat checks, fly whips, jewelry, chicks
Enough kicks, fitted crown, buttoned down
Underneath the white T lies the four pound
This is forty-five minutes of menacing
Dismantling, any MC opponent stepping in the zone
Get ya face blown (Get ya face blown)




Observe the word, when I speak, get the truth's heard
True to the curb, Wu classic is the new birth
Spreading the blessing across seven continents
Arm of the trench, there's no form of defense
Entertainment, nine swords swing rapid
Check the techniques, first bow to The Abbott
Witty Unpredictable, gritty individual
Valid, if it's Actual, Talent and it's Natural
Game, rugged like the train, pump it in ya vein
I and I ride or die under the name
W-U, the primary, ya secondary
Definitely not necessary, the legendary
You printed the blueprints to do this shit
Moving the youth in the bricks
Spit poison tipped darts that rip hearts
Through the chest, when I manifest my sick art


Speaking my mind, fall in line when I spit mine
Still in my prime, still'll shine til it quit time
If this is a crime, find me guilty, I'm so sublime
So rapid with rhymes, sayin' I'm slacking is assonine
Revealing the truth, catching feelings, it's still the Wu
Gorilla the booth, body armored, them killa proof
In living proof, I'm the Wittiest Unpredictable
Most Talented rap muthafucker you ever listened to


I'm a hustler, I grind til my pack is done
Give a seed mad knowledge til they crack and run
Can't nobody fuck with me, I'm just too nice
Smack niggas in they head everytime I write
Yo, I'm straight from Park Hill where the guns is popping
Where them little black kids do they grocery shopping
Go to school fucked up, it's Africa Island
We poor in the bricks but inside it's nothing but talent




And I say, grace is the man greatly to be praised
Selassie I liveth everytime
I say, Jah shall execute judgment and justice and none shall escape Lord of mercy
What me say?!
Selassie I liveth every time
What me say?!


Boy, you coulda put on the wings of the morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I
Fly inna the air, you must fall inna the sea
There is no escape from His Majesty


A long time he a tell you 'bout the dirty slavery
A long time he a tell you 'bout the brutality
A long time he a tell you 'bout the hypocrisy
Me warn you, 'bout recent monarchy
Me warn you, all 'bout we black liberty
Me warn you, all 'bout we equality
Me warn you, all 'bout Marcus Garvey
We beg you, all fi love His Majesty
Selassie I, so let it be
Selassie I, power of The Trinity
A x-amount of nations bow down 'pon them knees
No stop from beg, and dem no stop from plea
And nowhere to run and there is -


Oh boy!
Put on the wings of the morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I
Lie inna the uttermost part of the sea
There is no escape from His Majesty


Here come that rudebwoy shit, criminology legit
Legalize dope to get me mega-rich Selassie I
We can all get by if we unify
Gettin chinky eye off the stimuli, blazin the cut
And all that good stuff, six-three walk with a strut
On these New York streets like baby what
Anything can happen, it usually does
I'm from Staten, the Island, peep me on G-Street, Ticallion
Everything is real ain't nuttin fronted
Counterfeit rapper haffa bungee
He's in it for the munties, M-O-N-E-Y
But you can't take it witcha when you die, Selassie high


Ethiopia a the wings, tell dem fi exit
'Cause no anti-Christ we nah go worship
Heights of life for the righteous, but the wicked haffi perish
With dem religion and dem ol' poli-tricks
Have the people dem a turn, and have the people dem a twist
Nuh show dem no love, a hatred dem cherish
Give dem some 16, and some rusty Matics
Have dem a hold up dem fingers and a push up dem fists
Lead the sheep dem astray, you must get punished
Cyan escape your judgment, stand up -


Oh boy!
Put on the wings of the morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I
Lie inna the uttermost part of the sea
There is no escape from His Majesty

So wha'?!
And one of these days when you hear a voice say, "Come."
Where you gonna run to?
Oh ohhh
I say, they're gonna run to the rocks and mountain, but there will be no rock
No rock!
They're gonna run to the rocks and mountain but there will be no rock
So wha' we say?!

New lands for you man and your family
Reminisce on back in the days, can it be
It was all so simple then, we all kin
And black-skinned, original Don set the trend
Let's be men, if not for us, then for the babies
The little ones the revolution has now begun


[Put on, put on the wings of the morning and fly

I'm from Staten, the Island, peep me on G-Street, Ticallion
Everything is real ain't nuttin fronted
Down a fake rapper haveta bungee
He's in it for the munties, money
But you can't take it witcha when you die, Selassie high

If you put-ta on de wings and tempt to exit
Then no conjure Christ and none gone bullshit
Ay Selai for the righteous but the wicked are to perish
With them burn the gun and them whole poli-tricks
Half the people dem a turn and half the people dem a twist
Now shoot dem, another ear-trick done perish

(Method Man)

Pull your shoes up, don't get stuck
Or get your frame struck, when my squad blitzin'
Hittin' like Mack trucks, head splittin' paper written
In windy cities like Chicago, no bullshh shh
You see me spittin' at the kitten with the lost mitten
As we engage in cold war gettin' frostbitten
Once again up in these stank drawers baby listen
One mind and for one cause, heavy hittin'
The penalty illegal ruffnecks, we bring ruckus
In pursuit of gold lines, can a nigga touch it
If I can't see ya can't truss it
A shady character like Buzz Buzzard
Lay him out like a plush rugged
Now you can love it, or leave it alone
We drink death and puff bone
Draggin' your body out the end zone
And any way the wind blow that's where you flow
That's why you be the first one caught, last to know
Body layin' out on the flo', substitute
Heavy players from the run and shoot, we open do'
Third and long, quarterback pack the cannon on
I go deep he drop bombs, that's when I touch down
Six points, what now?
Once again who comin' through in the clutch now, perfect strangerous?
Ever since I came with this, and wrecked a body
You convinced like Lombardi, that Johnny Dangerous
Offensive shotgun
Calm in the pocket I got one, in the milli gun
Deep threats to chose from, that's how it goes son
You win some you lose some, it's in the game



You win some you lose some that's how it goes son
You win some you lose some it's in the game
You win some you lose some, that's how it goes son
You win some you lose some, it's in the game

(Ricky Watters)

From the football field
(It's in the game, you win some you lose some, it's in the game)
To the mountain, ya know what I'm sayin'?
(That's how it goes son, that's how it goes
You win some you lose some, it's in the game)

Freestylin', profilin', won't catch me smilin'
Straight from Fema Island, buckwhylin', I'm stylin'
A funky type of style with the lyrical incision
Shit locked down, like my niggas out in prison
Good riddance, keep it hidden, up in my knapsack
Sippin' cognac, while I vibe off this funky track
Yo bring it back, or make it hit harder
Infiltrate your mind like Nino at the Carter, but smarter
So drop harder, if you wanna conjugate
Verbs and nouns, make it profound as I pound
In your ear piece I'm the beast
To say the least, we must increase, the peace
But keep it real, so I can feel, the skills
Funky fresh rhymes I will build so I kill
And thrill, lyrics spittin', through my lips
Doing backflips, it's another hit
Come take a sip, of the running Waters
Lyrically I slaughter, mentally I author
The rhymes that you feel to the map
Crushin' double barrels, sing em out like carols
Who it be? It be I, the nigga with the chinky eyes
From NY, city we committee we gets busy
With killa beez on the swarm
Lyrically we storm, mentally a lord
Verbally I bomb, guard your grill
It's the man that chill, run for the hills from Grassville
Drillin' rhymes straight on tracks and double cuff
Another TV, and they loved it






The fox, is kinda foxy, Mr. Wolf he's the guy
Who chased Red through the woods and ate Grandma
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
Unlike the wolf, who made a widower of Grandpa


Yo, must I flex my cash, to sex yo' ass
I wet the Ave. when I set my path
The 'Vette don't crash, I'm built to long last
Grab my money clip, I hit the bong fast
Earn my respect, my checks they better cash
Finger on the trigger with my nigga Fred Glass
Knuckles is brass, start snuffin you fast
Jumpin outta cabs, grabbin money bags
Next shot go right through your hovercraft
You do the math my acid tongue slash
When will you learn it's return of Shaft
The genuine thriller, the Miller Draft
My force might blur, the Porsche'll purr
The apple martini, of course it's stirred
I'll do the honor,  the Shaolin bomber
Shark skin armor, I'll bring the drama




Damn, defecatin' on the map
Wu-Tang takin it back, no fakin in the rap
How real is that, cause niggas hatin on the fact
That the kid is blazin this track and hatin on 'em back
My dough's stacked up with O's, who the mack
Duckin po'-po's blowin smoke O's in the 'Llac
To be exact, don't want no hassle with the stack
In the Big Apple, we the rotten apples in the back
Yeah, it's all grillin, how the fuck y'all feelin?
Non-stop park killin, on the block we was killin 'em
The arch villans, when the blood start spillin
Any stuck start squealin, body bags we was fillin 'em
Yeah, now I got it in the smash
Ounce of marijuana and a llama in the dash
Me and my comrades followin the cash
And livin e'ry day like tomorrow is the last




I'm like the St. Bernard to ya baby when you're lost out in the snow
Like a coyote out on the desert...
Where the foxes never go
And the wolf, they never go...


Yo, would you recognize a jewel for what it is when you see it
Or would you take it for somethin else and get to' the fuck up
Men come together for the common cause
To beat yo' ass, just because
There's a line you don't cross offendin the boss
While of course his one selectin through your head shot
I'm back in the yard again, the bars callin
15 sets of this will have you swollen
Ladies like, "Damn papa you lookin right
I'd love to give you some of this pussy and I'm a dyke"
I write when the energy's right to spark friction
DJ cuttin it, spinnin it back mixin
Great pop knock tickin, poetry description
For the motion picture reenactment
Activate a hired assassin, keep it classic
Rap evolution every black, yo pass that









These kids are sour until the day that theyre chewed down
Thats bad news now they now they bringin bad news down
First theyre sour then theyre sweet little dudes
And they guna fight the power till they food
Now eat em up, Shut up and eat em up
This beat goes hard I just gotta eat it up
Its like im runnin , I gotta eat it up
And when they candy goes raw just gotta eat it up


Coming back out of the cracks of sofas and fanny packs
This ain't a candy rap this is where the candy attacks
See, when they lost that's when their sanity snaps
They break laws, not jaw-breakers, but break jaws
In fact, real heavy like a monkey on your back
Got some thumb-tacks playing pin the donkey with your cat
But fuck that plant a fire cracker where you dump at
Right besides the shower where you keep the penis pump at
Oh no, they creepin' like some ninjas in their dojo
They knock the little man off the horsey on your polo
Crushin all your dreams, cut the string from your yoyo
Trade your Lamborghini for a Volvo
I bet you thought that this was a promo
But nono, this is Boba Fett meets Han Solo
Kids gone loco, until you sink your teeth in
You know the motto, if life's a treat then you're eatin




Oh snap, look what fell out the patch
Right in this fool's lap, how uncool is that
All right jack, now you're on the wrong side of the map
With a busted GPS and on the wrong side of the snacks
They fight back, in fact rolling like the army
Throw bleach in laundry, unfold your origami
I like that some snacks sweeter in the end
But then again, ain't nothin' sweeter then revenge
Now they are on your facebook deleting all your friends
Clogging up your toilet with a poop eating grin
All up in your closet cutting holes in every pocket that you like to keep your wallet and I promise I'm a pimp
Wipe the music off your MP3
Burn a rug, pull the plug on your MTV
This is thug vision in 3D
These kids arent worth it they play dirty like they are ODB



(Chorus 2x - Chedda Bang)
Show some respect when we come through
Worldwide, let me see your ws

(Chorus 2x - Hanz On)
Throw em up, turn em over, what it do, what it do
Meth Man Murda gonna perish you

(Verse 1 - Method Man)
These rappers rap backwards, I dont rap with them rap dudes
2Pac backwards, pull that ratchet & cap too
Back to 93 when I still was holding those capsules
I also had a 38, yall dont give me no hassle
Keith Kool, G Rap moves, it's only natural
When on the road to riches, I hit the horn when I pass you beep beep
Pardon my sneeze. Haters get atchew
Ballers trying to move with the white, now would Shaq do
Go harder in the paint. Slap you like ya barber
Or the 6th man, thinking he a starter when he aint
Im a sick man, but smarter than you think
And its a thin line between the driver & the robber in the bank
See Im cut like a barber with a shank, cool
Women going swimming with their drinks, pools
Now who hasnt heard her that Meth Man & Uncle Murda
Its like your cousin trying to kill you with your uncles burner

(Chorus 2x - Chedda Bang)
Show some respect when we come through
Worldwide, let me see your ws

(Chorus 2x - Hanz On)
Throw em up, turn em over, what it do, what it do
Meth Man Murda gonna perish you

(Verse 2 - Uncle Murda)
Yeah Im Uncle Murda from the jects
Yeah Im disrespectful, but get a lot respect
When Im waving the tech, you better protect your neck
Got em looking like Inspectah, the way their hitting the deck
I with the METHOD man, its feelin like the 90s back when my tech use to jam
18 putting pressure on these chumps, sending niggas thats in their 30s to go & get my dutch
Cash rules everything around me. Im cookin a brick
Feelin like the chef, wearing my Cuban linx. I was ODB, creepin with dirty hos
Bumpin 36 chambers with 36 hos
Fuck the world, dont ask me for shit
This that Brooklyn, Shaolin Big & Meth shit
This that shit you bump, before you catch a body
NY back on their shit. I hope these niggas copy

(Chorus 2x - Chedda Bang)
Show some respect when we come through
Worldwide, let me see your ws

(Chorus 2x - Hanz On)
Throw em up, turn em over, what it do, what it do
Meth Man Murda gonna perish you

Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's
Remember them kids that came off with 8 million
Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavillions
Them flower heads must have been stupid
Tell me how the fuck black niggas get caught wit all that loot kid
That's jet money, undaground money
Submarines and rings too bad you fucked up dummies

Cosa cosa, come on...




You ain't heard us in a minute, you heard us in a minute, man
(Wu-Tang!)
I keep banging on you niggas, finger on my trigger, man
(Wu-Tang!)


I love bankrolls, stank hoes, camera shots, Kangols, bangles
Pink records, check it, yeah, I make those
More paper than Kinko's, check my lingo, bingo
On my face, honey, not a wrinkle, trinkle
My twinkle twinkle, make your toenails crinkle
Twist up a dinkle, and honey, let's mingle, jingle
When the nightfall, I'm tight with my white walls
The greedy pain, draining on my life force
Behold the pale white horse, the hype loss with tight jaws
Fight law off, cuz I don't like ya'll
Huh, I'm from the tar pits, the hard target to squash the market
You're brain washed, watch the starships
I make cars flip, Deck bomb atomic, Islamic arms
Kiss the comet, this time, he's gone
I grip the don, rip arms out the socket, cock it
Fly logic, now watch me sky rocket, watch it
Hot as the tropic get, bulletproof asaphogus
Steel cage confidence, burn it on a floppy disc
Swerve the metropolis, my whole team in back of me
You just a half of ki, I'm a coke factory

 (x2)
You ain't heard us in a minute, you heard us in a minute, man
(Wu-Tang!)
I keep banging on you niggas, finger on my trigger, man
(Wu-Tang!)


Yo, thank god it's Friday, like it's just me and my chick
Cruising the highway, she twisting my piff
You see I'm living proof that crime pay, the type that go at a bitch
The type to shoot the gift, and blow every clip
I know this money like the back of my hand, you get the back of my hand
Just like a fiend who took a package and ran
Po-po be hopping out of passenger vans, harassing niggas in Park Hill
For marked bills, ratchets and grams
So I move like I'm ducking a charge, I'm trying to set up shop
Get this gwop, get the fuck out of dodge
Most my niggas like to puff in the car, most these hoes emotionally scared
And keep the works stuffed in they bras
This is ghetto rap, where the pot be calling the kettle black
My bullets trynna see where they head is at, I'm heading back
To the slums, back to the block, I got the Clan on my back
And you know we heading back to the top, nigga

 (x2)
You ain't heard us in a minute, you heard us in a minute, man
(Wu-Tang!)
I keep banging on you niggas, finger on my trigger, man
(Wu-Tang!)

To all you motherfuckin' knotty-headed niggas
Yo, to the camouflage large niggas
Bitch, where the fuck is my bottle?
Bring that fuckin' meth in here!
Yo yo yo yo
Now we gonna drink some good Night train


Champion gear that I rock, you get your boots knocked
Then attack you like a pit, then lock shit down
As I come and freaks the sound
Hardcore, but givin' you more and more like ding!
Nah, shorty, get you open like six packs
Killa Beez attack, flippin' what, murder one
Phat tracks, aight, I kick it like a Nike Flight
Word life, I get that ass robbed on spite
Check the method from Bedrock 'cause I rock your head to bed
Just like rockin' what? Twin Glocks!
Shake the ground while my beats just break you down
Raw sound, goin' to war right now
So, yo, bombin', We Usually Take All Niggas Garments
Save your breath before I vomit


I be that insane nigga from the psycho ward
I'm on the trigger, plus I got the Wu-Tang sword
So how you figure that you can even fuck with mine?
Hey, yo, RZA! Hit me with that shit one time!
And pull a foul, niggas, save the beef for the cow
I'm milkin' this ho, this is my show, Tical
The fuck you wanna do for this mic piece, duke?
I'm like a sniper, hyper off the ginseng root
PLO Style, buddha monks with the owls
Now who's the fuckin' man? Meth-Tical


On the chessbox
"Wu-Tang style"


I leave the mic in body bags, my rap style has
The force to leave you lost like the tribe of Shabazz
Murderous material made by a madman
It's the mic wrecker, Inspectah, bad man
From the bad lands of the killer
Rap fanatic representin' with the skill that's iller
Dare to compare, get pierced just like your ear
The Shooby Doo-Wop pop, strictly hardware
Armed and geared, 'cause I just broke out the prison
Charged by the system for murderin' the rhythm
Now lo and behold another deadly episode
Bound to catch another fuckin' charge when I explode


Slammin' a hype-ass verse 'til your head burst
I ramshack dead in the track, and that's that
Rap assassin, fast and quick to blast and hardrock
I ran up in spots like Fort Knox
I'm hot, top notch, Ghost thinks with logic
Flashbacks how I attacked your whole project
I'm raw, I'm rugged and raw, I repeat
If I die, my seed'll be ill like me
Approachin' me, yo, out of respect, chops to neck
I get vexed, like crashin' up a phat-ass Lex
So, clear the way! Make way! Yo, open the cage!
Peace, I'm out, jettin' like a runaway slave


You gettin' stripped from your garments, boy, run your jewels
All the meth got me open like fallopian tubes
I bring death to a snake when he least expect
Ain't a damn thing changed, boy, Protect Ya Neck
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah jam is fatal
Quick to stick my Wu-Tang sword right through your navel
Suspenseful force bein' brought through my utensil
The pencil, I bring strong winds up against you
Havoc, then run up through your county like the Maverick
Caps through the tablets, I gots to make the fabrics


A-a-a-ah-ah, are you a warrior killer slicin' shit like a samurai?
The Ol' Dirty Bastard from the bar
Ol' Dirty clan of terrorists
Comin' at your ass like a sorceress, shootin' that piss
Niggas be gettin' on my fuckin' nerves
Rhymes they be kickin'
Make me wanna kick their fuckin' ass to the curb
Boy got funky fresh like the Old Specialist
A carrier, messenger, bury ya
This experience is for the whole experience
Let it be applied, Unique drop that science


M-M-My clan is thick like plaster, bust ya, slash ya
Slit a nigga back like a Dutch Master
Killer, style jumped off in Killa Hilla
I was the thriller in the Ali-Frazier Manila
I came down with phat tracks that combine and interlock
Like gettin' smashed by a cinder block
Pow! Now it's all over; niggas seein' pink hearts
Yellow moons, orange stars, and green clovers




Niggas on the left, brag shit to death
Now hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, c'mon and attract to what
Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, brag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, c'mon and attract to what
This goes back to nineteen..
Ahem, check it, yo

Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit


Yo, there's no place to hide as I step inside the room
Dr. Doom, prepare for the boom
Bam! Aw, man! I slam, jam, now scream like Tarzan
I be tossin' and flossin', my style is awesome
I'm causin' more family feud than Richard Dawson
And the survey said you're dead
Fatal Flying Guillotine chops off your fuckin' head
MZA, who was that? Ayo, the Wu is back
Makin' niggas go Bo! Bo! like I'm Super Cat
Me fear no one, oh no, here come
The Wu-Tang shogun, killer to my eardrum


Put the needle to the groove, I gets rude
And I'm forced to fuck it up
My style carries like a pick-up truck
Cross the clear blue yonder, sea to shinin' sea
I slam tracks like quarterback sacks from L.T.
Now why try and test the Rebel INS?
Blessed since the birth, I earth-slam your best
'Cause I bake the cake, then take the cake
And eat it, too, with my crew while we head state to state


And if you want beef, then bring the ruckus!
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthing ta fuck wit
Straight from the motherfuckin' slums that's busted
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthing ta fuck wit


Hah! Lebonon, step up, boy!
Represent! Chop his head off, kid!


The Meth will come out tomorrow
Styles, conditions, bizarre, bizarro
Flow, with more afro than Rollo
Comin' to a fork in the road, which way to go? Just follow
Meth is the legend, niggas is sleepy hollow
In fact I'm a hard act to follow
I dealt for dolo, Bogart comin' on through
Niggas is like, "Oh my God, not you!"
Yes, I come to get a slice of the punk and the pie
Rather do than die, check my flavor
Comin' from the RZA, which is short for The Razor
Who make me reminisce true
Like dj vu, I'm rubber, niggas is like glue
Whatever you say rubs off me sticks to you


Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit


Ahh-hah! Yeah! Representin' Brooklyn, Queens

The Rugged Lands of Shaolin
Niggas from Virginia, Atlanta, our boys in Ohio
Comin' through with the crazy Y-O Y-O
Yo, niggas from The Source
My man Kelly Woo from the Gavin
Will Strickland, Jason Staton, yeah
True, true, my nigga Crown, what's goin' down, boy?
We ain't nuthing ta fuck wit
The whole Texas mob, the Chicago mob
Niggas from Detroit, fuckin' California squadron
Comin' through, you know what I'm sayin'?
The whole fuckin' West Coast to the whole East
Niggas from D.C., down in Maryland
All the way over there in Morgan State
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthing ta fuck wit
All over the whole fuckin' globe, comin' through, boy
Peace to the fuckin' Zulu Nation
Peace to all the Gods and the Earths, word is bond
Wu-Tang slang, choppin' heads, boy
It ain't safe no more, peace!




My seeds grow and his seeds marry his seeds
My seeds grow and his seeds marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang forever, baby


It's good to see the Wu-Tang family under one roof
We celebrate, toastin' shots, Ciroc 40 proof
Burgers on the grill and fried fish
The wiz made potato salad, greens for a side dish
Cold water, mill and reminisce with cousins and sisters
Children on the grass playin' ball and Twister
Fresh lemonade is made, we playin' spades
My nephews turn the livin' room into an arcade
Aunt's cherry baked pie, surprise, Johnny showed up
You can tell from the smell in the air, somethin' rolled up
It's love, peace and happiness, with the joy and laughter
Camera phones flashes, the moment is captured


It's so nice to see all the folks you love together
Sittin' and talkin' 'bout all the things that's been goin' down


It's goin' down
We rock all in together now, Wu-Tang forever now
Twenty years later we still bang whatever now
Turn change to cheddar
If I could take a quote from Obama, change is better
I vow to never let you down
Remember Meth Tical?
In my circle haters was never 'round
I'm a boss, owe that to Kevin Lile
Reunited, the whole world excited
Wu-Tang is for the kids and people and girls invited


Family reunion
Got to have a family reunion
Family reunion
It's so nice to come together
To get together
I wish grandma could see
The whole family
I sure miss her face
And her warm and tender embrace


I miss my grandmother, my auntie and Unique Ason
I knew Dirt was high when he had that face on
Fangs hangin' out his mouth, his fronts was golden
Wildin', record execs can't control him
He said ish like me and Mariah
Hit me, woah-woah-woah, that's fire
Still no matter what we gon' rep the name
Look at your family, we got twenty years in the game


A family reunion
Gonna have a family reunion ooh, ooh
Family reunion
It's so nice to come together
To get together


Aye yo
I'd like to make a toast to my Wu-Tang family
All over the globe
East coast, west coast
All my brothas in the hood keepin' it good
Peace to the Gods and Earths
All my Latino brothers
My Asian brothers, my Caucasian brothers
Wu-Tang Forever



Intro: Method Man

Ain't what you want baby
It's what you need baby
Ain't what you want baby
It's what you neeeeeeeed

Verse One: RZA

Yo diamond crystal rings sharp like icicles
Nickel plated pistols, official Wu-Wear covers my physical
Insulated thermal Wallabees drain they co four butt solos
Photographic prototype static-free motivated soldier
Or Wu say boulder head flower
You can detect the true and living God from his aura
Keep your sword straight, maintain your weight
But he ate too much monosodiumglutumate, and polysorbate
And drunk grape concentrate, with sodium benzoate
Fried the chicken thighs in triglycerides
And his bitch advertised her breast size
Eighty-five didn't realize, til the truth opened up his eyes
Then he became highly civilized
And spent time amongst the wise, went through a garment renaissance
And stopped wearing Benetton
Tommy Hill, Perry Ellis, Nautica, or Liz Claiborne
Ocean Pacific, Fila, Bill Blass and leave fitted
Quit the Armani sweaters with the Gucci wool knitted
Now all he buys, Kani's, Cross Colours, Shabazz Brothers
Mecca, Pelly Pell, 88, North Q, Bear and a few others
For the new year, strictly Wu-Wear

Chorus: Method Man

Ain't what you want baby
It's what you need baby
Ain't what you waaaaaant

Verse Two: Cappadonna

Pelle Pelle had the top dresser
One man catalog the London Fog casual hog
Bear denim with the Cash Wu Nike and Kangol king
Everyday, DLO jacket equipped with the drawstring
Fila supply big daddy Starter hat, The brown-skin derby match the Tommy Hill; Advil
Double button Woolridge, red dickie turtleneck
Mockneck, eighteen carat holdin my twenty-two shine
In this like Macy's or Bloomingdale's
The Century 21 son, the new portfolio dunn
Now it's my time, Asian Wu-Wear, Cappa fleece wear
One wear plaza, Donna hold the best of all year
Plus blue wear, Wu-Wear, what's going on
We're the best of this year, Wu-Wear and fleece wear

Verse Three: Method Man

Ain't what you want baby
It's what you need baby
Just come see me
Satisfaction guaranteed baby
Just hold your own baby
And just rock on baby
I got this wine on my mind
Feelin fine darlin
Now all you see baby
Ain't what you need baby
I wanna know just how low
It goes
Official nasty asses, straight shots in dirty glasses
Wu-Wear fleece for you and your stinkin piece
Hard time and killer tactics

Repeat 2x




Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Wu-Tang, nigga, that's what's up (one)
Wu-Tang, nigga, that's what's up
(That's what's up)
Eh, eh, eh
Wu-Tang, nigga, that's what's up
Wu-Tang, nigga, that's what's up


Wu-Tang, nigga, Crash Ya Crew , laugh at you
You bastard, you, pass through, slap an ass or two
Hear me roar, Timbaland tree, weed galore
MC's with gusto y'all ain't neva seen befo'
El-Producto, pass that, ya puff too slow
That's what's up, yo, the kid with the buck-toothed flow
Oh, that's Meth Man, southpaw, I throw my left hand
To that hardcore shit that even make the Tec jam
Oh my goodness! Trust me, ain't nuttin' like some hood shit
Gotta love my dogs but ain't nuttin' like a good bitch
Strictly, if I'm goin' down, she comin' wit me
Whole time screamin', "Oh my God!", ain't no mystery


Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, you either step or get stepped upon
Correct me if I'm wrong but fake thugs never last long
Can't wait until ya fake ass gone
Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, you either step or get stepped upon
Nigga, uh-oh! I think they're playin' our song
Lit blunts, Clan in the front, sayin' "It's on!"


Try to Wu hate, duck, you could suck my
Watch the block get clear when I buck my
Boomerang darts, you can't duck my
No tellin' which Clan man you got struck by
Chains get tucked when he walk by, hawk eye
Arrows bein' fired from crossbow, I talk fly
You can't Etcha-sketch all my rhyme threat
Try to bite my flow, you catch ya throat strep
Soaked in cess, dope, you eat the cold Tec's
Bold flex, W crown, the ice O-X
Up in the oolie, yo, who you know?
John Bizzi, Ghost Deini, Rollie Finger and them toolies yo
Stainless Bobby, boy, you have an English folly
To try to detain the slang that we can to polly
Plus you didn't peep Irief, kid, you sleep
I seen this heap of shit, you in steep




Yo, amist the gravel, play the words of the Big Apple
Broadcastin' live from the pits of the battle
Wigs split and rattled, get shook out ya saddle
You ever hear me losin', one of y'all fix the panel
Ask who? Wu, that's true, known piranhas
Who knows drama, fathers of your whole persona
The mad doctor, stay locked in the O-R
In too deep, beyond reach of the sonar
Still a vet, say my name next to hall of fame
Hurtin' third string players, first day in the game
It's on, son, the Killa Bee swarm come
Make the world shake with one continuous drum




Wave ya gun, Killa (I got you)
Shoot this nigga in his face fast, mumblin' (I heard y'all forgot Wu)
Wear ya crown, black down (Watch the block too)
Blow at y'all niggas (Blowin' at the cops too)
Eh-yo, my wallets stay bulletproofs, racin' in Coups, yea we the realest
Ultraviolet leathers on, pealin' this, love lookin' the illest
Gorilla things, monster background with a history
You're pumpin' crack, yap clowns, we all real in here
Strap a bomb on a family member, let y'all niggas know we here
Blasted, it's like cheeba when I splashed it
Real reefer heads'll know the meanin' of hittin' glass
I told y'alls, against y'all, Ginsengs, avenge Gods
Picture me stabbin' you in the yard for R's
Kid saw Staten, nine Bin Ladens
Valors on, colorful draws, lookin' all relaxed in


Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, You either step or get stepped upon
Correct me if I'm wrong but fake thugs never last long
Can't wait until ya fake ass gone
Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, You either step or get stepped upon
Nigga, uh-oh! I think they're playin' our song
Lit blunts, Clan in the front, sayin' "It's on!"




Yo, I'm bout to hit you with this ya'meen
On top of the ya'meen, with a lil' bit of ya'meen mixed in
Ya'meen? Yeah... yeah... yo


How should I get it started, fuck it, just get it started
These trash talking artists is nothing, niggas is garbage
When Meth strike his target, leave it dearly departed
His flow is clearly the hardest, y'all gon' feel me regardless
Might break a promise, but never, breaking the code
Some get popped and call for they mamma, when the drama unfolds
My block, hot as a sauna, never wind up and joke
Crack deals on every corner, fiends wanna foam you with soap
And, if life's a bitch, then I bet she bitter and cold
Everytime she thinking I fold, seven figures get sold
Meth, all in your chest, or inhale it all in your nose
Cops don't know about this Method, but smell it all in his clothes
Yup, I'm still intact, how real is that, I'm back
With enough Sensamilla to fill ya vanilla wraps up
New York, New York, rock tube socks and Timberlands
Cuz hip hop ain't feeling them flip-flops, they feminine


I'm the one shot dealing, one shot killing it (ya'meen)
Yeah, it's the top billing, the block feeling like (ya'meen)
Yeah, fuck with me (ya'meen), yeah, fuck with me (ya'meen)
If you not for squealing, and for spilling the (ya'meen)
The streets is watching the apple rotten like (ya'meen)
Plus the B.B. hot and the towers dropping like (ya'meen)
Yeah, fuck with this (ya'meen), yeah, fuck with this (ya'meen)
If you get it popping, or get to popping 'em (ya'meen)


You know the haters diss you, let's deal with bigger issues
You know New York is dying after all the shit we been through
And we done lost B.I.G., we done lost Pun
Homey, you can't live, gotta go and get them guns
You know the hammers'll lose your cabbage, them dudes do damage
Send Zulu Nation through Reaganomics, we move them package
We pushing rain pain, gotta go and get that money
Y'all going "hey hey", but don't that pen look lovely
You - must - not - know - who - y'all niggas is fucking with
I - can - take - life - nig... just for the fuck of it
Crack's crazy, that nigga'll smack babies
Clap ladies for yackin' you gon' catch shady
Call it a mass shower, the way them hollow's drizzle
Mr. Potato Head, you know them things can't miss you
The Average Joe, with an average flow
Me and Meth bringing back New York, nigga




You don't like me, you can get what's right above the testicles
S.P., turn your top five into vegetables
You don't believe me, get 'em all in a room
And the next five, I plan to getting all of them soon
Y'all can meet me at the table that's round, or get ya place in the ground
That's what you get, when you facing me, clown
Who got the crown, I'm piss on it now, while you wearing it
Nobody nicer than Ghost, I ain't hearing it
Been Nike Airing it, white tee out
Stick-up kid season when the dice be out
I'm a thug or star investing in living, niggas sippin' soup
Ghost rapper, knocking out your icey mouth
Niggas in the East wanna unite, not me
If you ain't sayin' I'm the best, you ain't come to be right
KnawImean? If you don't, then you not of being
Your four-four, knock little pieces off of your spleen, nigga






Ay yo I'm skinned up, Nike's is scuffed
Still buggin' earlier around four how I escaped the bust
The way I fell cracked the face of my watch
My mans chantin' me on like "Run son! Don't go up in the spot"
Jettin' through bushes and backyards, neighbors is rattin' me out
Dogs is barkin' all you hear is the car's sirens
I'm tryin' to think and toss the iron
Bomb in my sweats got me runnin' funny, you think I'm lyin'
May God strike me if he don't like me, I'm tired and I'm out of breath
The weed got me paranoid, my heart's poundin' through my chest
Tryin' to focus up and make progress
That's what I get for slingin' in them projects
Next thing you know I'm in this bitch's crib chillin'
Told her my story and like this I had her legs in the ceiling
Cookin' me fries, fish sticks, hot side of them biscuits
While she doin' this, the bitch still slidin' on lipstick
Now I got the fat stomach on, she crackin' a dutch
I'm playin' with her pussy on the couch, I'm ready to fuck
Like come here miss lady wop, where you put the condom box?
She finished off the last one, oh shit I hear the cops
Handcuffs and talkies, I mashed her white Yorkie
Jettin' up the stairs, them pigs want revenge like Porky's
So I slid, hid behind the wall, opened the door
Like ooo I seen my man Meth goin' in raw
So he jumped up balls out, hid in the closet
I'm dyin' laughin', he said "Yo Starks be quiet!"


...and let me put my drawers on, nigga what kinda dope you on?
Should've knocked before you came in the spot, Ghost you wrong
Bustin' in here on that government shit
Got this chick screamin' grabbin the sheets tryin' to cover her tits
She's asthmatic and you laughin' son
I bump my toe on the nightstand just runnin' tryin' to grab the gun
Shit's real man, you spazzin' dun
There comes a time in a man's life, he gotta toss his pack and run
You know we family like Crack and Pun
But Mr. GFK, state your business after that be one
Now can it be that you hot lord?
You did some shit on the block that the cops tryin to lock you for?
Can't believe you blowin' the spot lord
My chick is buggin', she trippin'
My dick keep slippin' out my boxer drawers
Now I'm caught up in the drug sting
Niggas is callin' my horn, police is hittin' every corner we on
Can't understand it, it's a thug thing
And in the moment of thought, I'm interrupted by Shallah Raekwon


I need my money Meth, gonna buy them hundred birds
Tell Tone get at me, all them little clients want work
He know we fresh out, tell the kid meet me, matter of fact beep me
Word to mother lord, son he got me hurt
You still fuckin' shorty? I knew it
The big mouth broad that be yolkin' my balls out
Her little brother wanted two bricks
You know the nigga licks, a Maybach on twenty-six
All he do is get money, hustle, he's a dick
He told me foul shit, wild shit
That nigga wear a lot of loud shit, no that Steve Rifkind style shit
Hit me with some other talk, him in New York
They robbed the Venezuelan niggas, stabbed his son with a fork
That was Jesus' rooster's little niece, little nooses
Father's homeboy, that's the kid who gave us a boost
He gave them things on the arm, said for us to be calm
And if some beef pop off, go ahead and ring the alarm




Crime scene, coppers and sirens
Helicopters and high beams, the tensions is rising
Fiends keeping the pipe clean
This is what life means, a dollar and a dream
Everybody wants nice things
The kid was only nineteen, hole in his chest now
He's fighting, for his last breath
He's seeing death its frightening
The grip on the ghetto is tightening
You try to do the right thing? They do you just like King
Now I can hear the night scream, Sirens and Light Beams
Popping off bad shots, hitting people that they ain't mean to pop
The neighborhoods in shock, block extremely hot
Another Black teen shot, thats dull routine to cops
Make sure they got good grades, work the minimum wage
Now hes laying on a stretcher, with nothing in him to save
Keep the ghetto, in whatever ghetto you at
Just dont love the ghetto, cause the ghetto dont love you back
You dont live until youve made your first million
And top models wanna have your children
I thought I told you Wu Tang is for the children
Way before rap moved crack in your building
Yeah, now whats the price of rice in China?
These women trying to raise the price on their vagina
Me? Im trying to live the life and get the grind up
Like Diddy, but I aint trying to give the shine (Shyne) up
Poppa, pop-off no question, yall dirty, like it raw, (no protection)
When the kid hold court, no objection
Meth needed money at the door, no exception
I go hard in the paint on a rapper
I go harder on a pussy no Viagra
You think Im tripping, aint into tricking
But I keep a snow bunny in the kitchen
Im the master like Killa




All day everyday with this rap souffl say WHAAAAT?
Situation be like this


Traces of lipstick on my collar
Baby you gotta do some more to get this last dollar
Hotter than lava when you cum believe that I'mma follow
Lady Madonna like to drink but she don't like to swallow
Rockin that Prada, honey stay up in the beauty parlor
Girl it would be my honor, make you my baby momma
Holla she hella proper
Fuck with it dumbin cousin, sucker for lovin buggin
Shuckin and duckin buckin, suckin then finger-fuckin
Here let me show you somethin
I knock the stuffin off that English muffin, can't tell me nuttin, uh-uh
Pushin yo' panic button when I'm stuck in
All of a sudden, baby conductin (BBC!) Ooh girl you nasty


Yo, I get it on poppin, Doc, unlockin your doors
Glock in my drawers sock in your mouth with a torn stockin
Wrapped around a noggin, I creep in while you park it
Shoot out the lights, darken the area, then hop in
Pick up my bigga nigga who helped me figure the plottin
Droppin the top, splittin the dough, shoppin in rotten
New York, birds flockin because I'm heavy like boats
Doc in coat, watch ya coat from fo' sparkin
Dearly departin, niggas, unforgettable can't be forgotten
Doc and Meth album enterin the top ten
Choppin the raw, lockin the block and
Only raw choppin this metaphor, so cops can stop watchin
I put em in and cock em, ready to Rock'Em Sock'Em
Renovate your apartment, when these two things barkin
My mackamichi knockin, bougie holes be spottin
On they tampons, I get em drippin like leaky faucets

Chorus: Redman, 
Now who a bitch nigga?!

Now who the shit nigga?!

Now who you with nigga?!

Who rock shit nigga?!


 Come on! "Keep bouncing!"
 Come on! "Keep bouncing!"
 Come on! "Keep bouncing!"

I figured it out: y'all niggas ain't as big as your mouth
My street value - well it won't even fit in your couch
When I bust titties come out, no matter what city
Hardcore committee's dumb the fuck out -- son should duck out!
Yo, nuttin to lose, pumpin the two up in your goose
Buckle your shoes, scuffle my boots, fuckin witchu
Blow my anaconda like Nirvana
Marijuana got bitches on they knees in they Gabbanas
Gettin em dirty dirty with the Hershey and enbalmin
Holla the drama, fire two in ya armor, your pigeon betta calm her
The ice is a honor, twin help me lift her arm up
La Bamba witcha momma, even dirty Hadonna
My dick is aeronomic, pull out and yell Geroni-mo
PPC! Ooh girl you nasty


Itchin to start the mission, flippin so keep yo' distance
Ain't go no pot to piss in? Ain't got no competition
Listen, I slip the clip in, trippin you get me lippin?
Commence to catch a whippin, now kids is actin different
Ditchin them double-dippin, chickens that keep forgettin
I ain't the one for trickin on anybody kitten
Rippin these compositions, scriptin them paper-writtens
Holdin and hittin stickin, ballin like Scottie Pippen
It's hot in Hell's Kitchen, but still I'm frostbitten
Shittin like "No he didn't," wipin my ass and splittin
Jett'n like Joan gettin, all in the zone
Settin' it off like Big Daddy and ain't no half-steppin'
I keep reppin -- Staten, you keep sweatin
Threaten and ass-bettin, duckin my Smith and Wessun
Trust in the Meth and catch-in-Hell
Will leave you restin in PEACE, (PPC!) Ooh girl you nasty

Chorus




Traces of lipstick on my collar

Choppin' it raw, lockin' 'n blockin'
Only raw choppin', it's metaphores, so cops can stop watchin'
