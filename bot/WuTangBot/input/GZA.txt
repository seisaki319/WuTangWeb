I took her off the showroom floor no money down
Near the Chrysler building in the heart of Midtown
200 horse-power under the hood
Junk in the trunk very far from damaged goods
Designer frames with windshields that stay tinted
The most beautiful thing someone invented
Her wrangler had a sticker on the bumper
A sign in case tow trucks tried to dump her
Rear view mirror that of Serena William
Staring was a crime then the look, kill 'em
Brushless showers and the Brazilian wax
Cash in the glove compartment free from tax
Low mileage on the odometer
Graduate with more degrees than a thermometer
Spark plugs for great conversation
She would focus on the finish line and destination
Steering in the right direction
Made sure I wore seat belts had air bags for protection
In her tank she loved to stash my tool
I kept her full, super-unleaded fuel
She had a room full of skirts and rims
The old ones used to swing off ropes that often hung from limbs
A temp at the Ford modeling agency
Suburban area where the Caucasians be
Her great-grandfather was a Cherokee Indian
Explorer and navigator traveling then begin
Sharpening his arrows on Plymouth Rock
Commander-in-chief who raise cattle on the selling of livestock
King of the frontier, rider of thoroughbreds
He was just as sharp as a needle without thread
Legend in truth but known to run the herd
His sons were oldsmobiles who drank thunderbird
Land cruisers sitting on fertile soil
With equipment that ran off expensive oil
Folks bragging said the horse pulled a Volkswagen
They love mustang sally and lollygagging
Fished in Lake Tahoe cooked the barracudas
Hunted impalas with the six-shooters
From a long range with the dog Rover
It was something else to see 'em knock them over


Some got caught in the crossfire
Bunch of rabbits indicating these dudes should retire
One was going bald rocking a sunroof
A gas guzzler in his grill was one tooth
A strong accent, and a beard like Lincoln
Who hated the golf course, but he loved drinking
Avenger, used to pick up chicks
Had magnums that were ram tough but thick
He wore blazers where he used to hide the Ruger
For encounters with the jaguars and cougars
A veteran who could salute and sing the anthem
In accord with the plan he was the phantom
He had a fat lady they called hummer
And umm, she needed body work the whole summer
She had a few friends who used to stay in a pound
Abandoned the parking lots, and junk yard bound
Regulars in rest areas and truck stops
Cassette players, known to make the tape pop
Gold diggers who on the cream like Wells Fargo
In Vegas, they circle around the Monte Carlo
You know the snakes with the fangs and vipers
Bloodsuckers who all used to piss from diapers
Met the Cavaliers at the Outback steakhouse
Chicken cutlets supreme just for takeout
One of them was forced to live in Astoria
Cause at the auction, they had crowned victoria
Since then her friends charged her battery
Had her running off with the sweets of flattery
She kept a loud muffler, couldn't trust her
Police used to always pull over this duster
A pothead who some called a firebird
A foul mouth, who could have used wiser words
Her man used to hustle and ran a crack corner
So insecure he kept LOJACK on her
Creeping with his visors low, high-beaming
Temper would accelerate, private eye scheming
He would check her consoles for rubbers
She would pass the inspection with flying colors
She would turn left if he said right
On her cycle, he would often run red lights
His voiced echoed as she dodged the convo

-----"PROTOOLS"-----

Her previous owner, all he did was bone her
Some drove her crazy, she was just a loner
He had her leaking transmission fluids
Said it was an accident, didn't mean to do it
No insurance with her grill decayed
She sobbed uncontrollably, still stayed
Another total eclipse of the heart
Like the freezing weather that never gave her a start
Plus he had a sidekick in his garage
And if he needed a boost, she would give him a charge
He was sentenced for running an escort service
Escaped from prison but made a few nervous
His baby mother had wifed a BMW
Number one on the list, so he brought trouble to
She done everything to regain her liberty
Tried to be outty, but went into delivery
Moved to Aspen, survived a avalanche
A different element, inside a fatter ranch
Far away, when she changed the pattern
The distance was like from Mercury to Saturn




Bobby said, "Fuck spending fifty on a whip, buy equip"
Mental flip, he got a thousand tracks stored on a chip
Said he had mad toys to make noise
He split and separate drums like asteroids
The concerned producer sampled this question
Hit him with the beat for the answer with extra compression
My sound travel, it quickly grab you
And equalize the pitch up, until it have you
Bugged out, tryna think you can match this
The portraits are too graphic
Panoramic view for you, stamp Wu
The beats are Gothic, the outcome will be catastrophic
We roadblocked it, checkpoints on your next joint
Now who the nigga you anoint?
700 volts on the track to slay
Murderous wordplay displayed from killing cascades
Throwing bullets in the air to test wind
Which way the cyclone spin? Counter or clockwise?
Still civilized
Kill spies on the wall as still flies, all dies


Give no extension on the lynching
It's tension if the name of the Clan is mentioned
It's the aura that's felt that causes one to flash his gun
And reveal how he really feel, confirmed
He'll never live after the show
See the promoter for the dough I'm taking, breaking his wax
Throwing my shit on to perform the selection from the Swarm
Day 2 breaks, it's a stormy Monday
My ninjas lay in ravines and ditches underneath shrubs and leaves
They breathed through underwater reefs
The enemy walks above, Clan remains subterraned in mud
Off shore banks, tanks approach the location
Bombarded by the circle of death formation
Telecom lines are sniped from these low altitude strikes
Shattering bulletproof helmets with shrapnel fragments of cell
Inhale these venomous thoughts that I propel
Through the north facility, the city must suffer
At the hand of the Chief's command, volts are sent
At three minute intervals the heat intenses
Deadening the power from electrical fences
Defences are down, shake a nigga up
Bounce him off the sound


You know what I'm saying?
The God ca-diver, in the streets of Iris
We talk about sex, money and drugs
(Ruled by power) And y'all cats don't know
What it's about (Love and power)
It goes deeper than what you see on TV
Killah Priest, come on


Burning desire, ebony eyes
Painted toenails, legacies die
Women by the well, Egyptian queens
Arabian sheiks paid to knock off rich kings for the joy some sing
Graveyards filled with scarlet widows
Who stabbed they husbands sleeping on silk pillows
Blood on they robes, disguised as beggar in cheap wool clothes
Lambs and wolves in black hoods pull out they gats
Like magic wands, casting spells, sending niggas to Hell
Trapping they souls in realms
Baptize them with Holy Water
Springing on the heads of plenty witches' daughters
Interviews with the richest reporters, silent nights over Nevada
A thousand Muslims bow before the Kaaba
Hebrews flee to the hills of Masada
For the love of God, guns make a loud sound
I'mma show you how thugs get down
Shootouts, bullets turn into bloodhounds and hunt you down
Cursed nation, lost generation
X-Files found them in the future as cosmic rulers
Fallen angels from space intruders
Dying saints, blood spilled on the floor like wet paint
See it in the pictures, read it like the lost scriptures
Absorb it with your 100 proof liquor


I shot the sheriff and the deputy secondly
Threatening the lives of those who threaten me
Lessening my chances of defeat by predetermining the victory
As taught by Sun Tzu in the chapter, after the third one
I heard my word shall be born, regardless to anything or anyone
Or else I die by the gun, my life has just begun
Thought I was living all along, but I was wrong
This long road I have to travel in countless battles
These filthy snakes with poison fangs and rattles
Kings, queens and pharaohs change to cattle
Unable to duck the Devil's arrow
Singing that his eye's on the sparrow, mind narrow
Superstitions, horoscopes and tarots
'Hark Heralds Angels' and Christmas carols
Graven images hang from the mantels
Man-made slaves in modern day Babel
Brought from Africa in golden robes and sandals
By wicked thieves and vandals
Who manhandled us with leather whips and burning candles
And rambled through our castle, leaving niggas shambles
Stole our golden sodas like some Arab camels
We gazed, amazed and baffled as he loaded his ammo
Into the barrel and blasted out our bone marrow
We were the Gretel and the Hansel, tricked by this wicked jackal
Children of my grand-old-daddy have me
In mind when they're lost in this wilderness blind




One, two
One, two
This how we do it from Brooklyn


Oh yeah that sounds kinda funky
Alright, break it down and then I'll start


Check it out
When I begin to wreck a hip-hop tune
The crowd reacts immediately, if not soon
I'm black and proud, I move the crowd
I raise from Hell, yo
My lyrics alone rock the bell
Of those who say that its me they wanna scar
Hmm, that's like George Burns without a cigar
So come in the game and project the hard image
But they can't never get past the line of scrimmage
Cause I'm on a defense, what a tough sequence
And you lack the knowledge to understand a pretense
So just from not planning it right you got sacked by a blitz of rhymes that will broken down stacks therefore
The mic was hyped but then your hand got stripped and ripped while it slipped from its stand in
What happened? You begin to cease to control it
You fumbled, couldn't rumble, so then I stole it
How did you think you could make first down?
If you were boxing, you wouldn't escape the first round
Save the ball, don't even begin to waste time, drop the mic
Before you reach fate, then you rhyme and realize
You were just weak from the start
You make demos, but really don't master the art
I know ya know deep down inside you can't flow
Plus, you're backwards, when I said red you said "Go!"
But you should've stopped, because the red was the bloodshed
But you ignored the warning and you went ahead
Try me G, by setting up a match
A fair one, meaning no strings attached, then bang!




We will fight till the night is done
We will live our lives tonight as one
We will live our lives tonight as one, one


I'm a bad mother, shut your mouth
Insanity, DVD, how I stretch 'em out
What the stress about? INS best out
Fact, you knew that before he left the house
Fresh at the produce section
Gaze at my shine like a showroom necklace
Death wish, stepping in Deck's direction
I'm checking niggas like test questions


Across 110th now, cross Belmont and Montauk
Camera hawk hawks the sidewalk
When they get to flexing muscle niggas bust you
Hustlers do you, gave you your first toolie
Cutting out of school to pump your first loose leaf
Think graduate to wait, take it out of state, duct tape
Anything of pulse and heroin
Emcees frozen, cuban link chains are golden
I'm ownin' everywhere I'm holdin' it up, to keep it raw
Math here, I got 'em keep coming back for more


Yo, man, I'm so turned up, all the marijuana burned up
Y'all don't want the drama, word up
The Wu first up, the game is the world versus us
Y'all was good 'til the world heard us
Y'all ain't want them Clan birds up
Y'all don't want your man served up, that'll get the fans worked up
Homie really wanna play, stir it up
I'mma catch me a wave, surfs up
Gliding on the track like this, make me wanna act like this
Make me wanna smack that trick
Make a killer really wanna yap that kid
If he opens up his yap that's it




Mass of minerals in a glass house
Playing 4th the Wu neutrinos will blast out
Letting out verbal thunder bolts
Until the world attract old and younger folks
Charge with the vitality of magnetism
In large reality with massive rhythm
The manual without technical part
From the beginning give off an electrical spark


I respect you if you respect me
Everything's for real, WTC
No fake ass shit, don't front the Remy
Break bread, never have pockets empty
Let's get it, flip it up then we can spend it
The money train, Killa Beez on your brain
W's everywhere, one on your chain
Homeboys for life, please don't change
You can hide at my house, it ain't no thing
If you see the pigs, don't say jack
Call me original, don't say cap
I'm on the low, might be at the murder
Holding off the place y'all cats never heard of
Yeah, chicks wanna peep me out
Nasty ass, want me to pee in their mouth
But now I'm out, about to link with sticks




Bang a few notes up top, we call it beast mode
Forget the street codes, show you like a deep throat
It gets rougher, you suffer from the heat stroke
Blast barrels, embrace my leaf smoke
Park Hillians radio for back up
Polish your act up, nigga need a back up
Syrup in my cup, no cut, straight up
UG's on the court, never miss a lay up


When the emcees came to live out their names
Some rode the bus, some rode the train
Some motherfuckers wish they never came
When they met the nine swordsmen of Wu-Tang
Nine Maseratis pulls up to this party hard
Body, the party is filled with Godbody
There out of shape models coming through with those bottles
And double D's please, all eyes follow
Pass me a bucket of ice, that's nice
Hit with the vodka, what you say proper
I drink with the copper, show up in a chopper
Stop her, she wanna have a mnage  trois
I can tell by the bra, RZA Ra-KZA-Keem is all is Allah
Do you wish or wish upon a star? Do you wish or wish upon a star?






Choose the sword, and you will join me
Choose the ball, and you join your mother... in death
You don't understand my words, but you must choose
{*baby gurgling*}
So... come boy, choose life or death


The only man a ho wait for
Is the sky-blue Bally kid, in '83 rocked Tale Lords
My Memorex performed tape decks, my own Fostex
Watch out for Haiti bitches, I heard they throw hex
Yo, Wu whole platoon is filled with raccoons
Corner-sitting wine niggas sipping Apple Boone
This ain't no white cartoon
Cause I be ducking crazy spades
The kid hold white shit like blacks rock ashy legs
Why is the sky blue? Why is water wet?
Why did Judas rat to Romans while Jesus slept?
Stand up, you're out of luck like two dogs stuck
Ironman be sipping rum, out of Stanley Cups, unflammable
Noriega, aiming nozzles stay windy in Chicago
Spine-tingle, mind boggles
Kangols in rainbow colors, promoters try to hold dough
Give me mine before Po wrap you up in so-and-so
I ran the Dark Ages, Constantine the Great, Henry the 8th
Built with Genghis Khan, the red suede Wally Don


I judge wisely as if nothing ever surprise me
Lounging between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece is like building stones in Greece
Our poems are deep, from ancient tomes I speak
I'm overwhelmed as my mind roams the realm
My eye's the visions, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above cloud
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fit
I leave them split like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips


Aiyo, camouflage chameleon, ninjas scaling your building
No time to grab the gun, they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent from the President to raid your residence
Because you had secret evidence and documents
On how they raped the continents and lynched the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew
The year 2002 the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Unloyal snakes get thrown in boiling lakes of hot oil
Up boils your skin, chickenheads getting slim like Olive Oyl
Only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential vitamin and minerals
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffing clouds inside my pillow
Rolling with the Lamb, Twelve Tribes a 144, 000 chosen
Protons Electrons Always Cause Explosions


The banks a G, all CREAM downs a bet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax-free shit by any means
Whether bounty-hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such swift cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like ham
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the length one-tenth
Woofers thump, tweeters hiss like air pumps
RZA shaved the track, niggas caught razor bumps
Scarred trying to figure who invented
These unprecedented, opium-scented, dark-tinted
Now watch me blow him out his shoes without clues
Cause I won't hesitate to detonate, I'm short fused




Speaking of this artform, the slang is dangerous
MC's are like sperm cells, a gang of us
Fighting to reach the egg, biting and lose a leg
Odds are like 1 to 10 million, the kin thread
One from a thousand speaks in his own voice
The other 999, imitates without choice
They never even knowing it, until the going gets rough
You see the Amplified Sample I'm throwing with
I grab the microphone, the unthinkable happens
See the rockets red glare like the guns when clapping
They still cage matching MC's thats scrapping
Not the UFC, but my opponent is tapping
So don't let a little bit of fear turn to hatred
I was sent as a savior to revive what was sacred
Also stop this uncalled for behavior
And sipping back cats, they lactase in flavor


Got word from the wise to let it drop
Set this on fire, take aim and let it pop
Because regardless to whom or what, even the door shut
I'm giving 'em straight raw, you bringing them all cut
Like Bolivian rock, your watered down hip hop
Raps so out of shape and far from tip top
Pearls next to pebbles, spoons against shovels
Dictators next to rebels, and Gods against devils


No time for backwards thinking, let's think ahead
If you want to sleep when you awake then make your bed
Alotta MC's came to see me on referals
Not even knowing that they would undergo great perils
These cutting edge methods from the most specialized
Faster than the last men, and before the dust'll fly
The lord of the art, strikes a chord in your heart
Your ear love to hear the God, ripping tracks apart
Me to hip hop, is like Einstein to science
A match made in heaven, most likely an alliance
Complex individual that you dream of being
Intellectual challenging, the all eye seeing
Got an appetite for heat, so then come and bite the beat
And digest the rest and don't stress the part you couldn't eat






Ecology is life
Life that surrounds us
Everyday living with the things that we bundle up
A single cell organism is the things that we coming from
Coming from the brain cus im insane in the membrane
Shout out to the lyrical miracle together
We are two lyrical individuals
All miracles start from something
The center of it is the nucleus
Cells divide and soon life is surrounding us


A girl wants to have a baby
Call that ovulation
Gotta concentrate on the first verse like the first step
Like fertilization
This sort of flow
Is a boat that'll never sees too float
Bringing old school rap with science
Like parental chromosomes
Watch every eye on me together like a morula
About 64 if you want a number now thats a show
Even though im blastocyst
Just a little hollow my fans follow
My fans follow Athen the great voice of tomorrow
Check my check my check my check my
Check my check my flow 1234
Like the cells in the embryos
Kicking down your door
I connect with my fans
Like a placenta
I nourishing with the knowledge
And excreting all the extra
And so I spit the extra
About ecology and biology
Shout out to Miss B
Cause she helped me see life logically
So you know I got to finish
You the turtle in this rabbit race I'm winning
And I will forever be spitting
And rocking the shows for centuries and more
In this rap game, I'm trying to hit the high score
But for now I'm delivering just like an umbilical cord


Oh god, where do i start, with human body parts
The first to do it Adam and Eve, or what you believe
The topic of discussion, talking 'bout these bodily functions
They got me rapping about sexual reproduction
Bars like a Twix split in 2 like a daughter cell
Kit-Kat got 4 the second telophase okay let's even the score
But back it up to the beginning of time
Well lets just say we beat our homies to the finish line
And if we didn't, best believe me then we would dead
It's like a million man march for a boiled egg
But the product is a living organism, with a heart and brain
Genetics from my pops, that's how this young spitter got his name
This girl said we gon' lose, but I don't believe in abortion
But I heard she got flow so I gotta take precaution
I got various flows like a chromosome
Macaulay Culkin in this game I guess I'm home alone
Delly




Bob Digi, U G.O.D, Raekwon the Chef, the Inspectah Deck
M.E.T.H.O.D., the B.O.B.B.,

The burners and the stash, we 'bout the cash
We got females that got it like that
The golden childs that bone the crowd
See, niggas in the place that bit my style
Well, I'm a singer, dancer, we bulletproof brothers
Wu-Tang got the answer
Cause if I had a chance to do it again
I will still keep the heat in my pants-uh


Y'all be nice to the crackheads, everybody listen up
I shot one of my bitches, the ho ain't trick enough
Word life to big screen Don, tapping dustbones out
With starwriters like I fucked Celine Dion
Stuck everything that's the god's honest beyond
We airin' niggas out, that's the type shit that we on
Official Wu-Tang headbanger
Flood your space with big waves like you did in Sri Lanka


I drink heavy gallons of cru, play the big part
Niggas got squid on the grill, selling kids Clarks
Finesse notes, yo, the Guess on with the vest pose
Yellow swede one matching hat with the grey gun
Niggas be rhymin' for nothing, then my team pull up
We all throw down y'all broke niggas stay frontin'
Lines come digital stupid, plus ain't got no jewelry on
Bet I'm still live and I'm coopin'
Two of my silverbacks run through a pack of your wolves
Front on react, we're sippin' Cognac  relax dude
Know I'm with these cracks dude


Yo, 1-2, Dirt McGirt
Solid tone smith with 6th shots, lick shots
Leave your head like a Shaolin monk with 6 dots
Brooklyn Zoo, Zoo
Brooklyn Zoo


It's the return of Bin Laden, grab your armor
Smash pretty boy niggas, crush their karma
Eat bones with alligators, roll deep with my entourage
My whole crew's fresh out the bars
Diggler AKA the Cab Driver
Drop him off in the middle of fire
Dirty Island, drag bodies to the Murderland
Knock niggas out hurtin' my hand


I remember in the elevator we was playin' corners
Now we play the corners and the cops is stayin' on us
Staten's where the war is
Where the court system's running out of warrants
Where TNT be jumping out the Taurus
For real I can't call it
You see I love Lucy cause she Lawless
Exactly like that 1-0-3-0-4 is
Snitch niggas swallow your tongue
Already know the island I'm from
And y'all don't want no problems with them


We got a history full of lightning victories
Conceptual breakthrough, it ain't no mystery
Long vision from giants in every way
Rap czars, magnificent flows for every day
From the East to the 'ville, from the West to the hills
Incredible rhymes, encouraging skills
From rat packs, the smallest crews were enormous
We hit 'em fast with an effortless performance
MCs start fleeing in flocks
Especially those that's more sensitive to heat and shock


We grindin' down to the bone, my name grounded in stone
I'm Mr. Violence we loungin' with chrome
Mr. Violence we lounge in his home, hit the housing on Rome
Shining like a hundred thousand in stones
Move mountains with poems, got a jones for dinero
1-6-zero my songs we throwin' elbows
The hoes cling, sho thing, we know kings
Only dime dikes with minds right, we choose Queens


Yeah, we wild like rockstars who smash guitars
Yo son split his face with the toast, he ain't ghost
It's no joke iron coat rifle with the stroke
One toke brains float, shot to the throat
Before the smoke hit, witness the killing, chilling crime scene
Body on the block, eyes open from the shock
Of being popped in the neck
Yet he still held a lit cigarette between his fingers
Danger when you step into the chamber with the Masta
Disaster, gotta blast ya cause I have to


The rat pack is back from the island of Stat'
Leave you cursed dust, cause you worship the Gat
The first one to snap drunk off the Smirnoff
Blow the bouncer's ear off, let him floss he the boss
Handcuffed, to the turntables like Wizard Theodore
See it's pure, let it rain pearly ounces
Bang him with the thing that hang from the trousers
You don't want no drama, I'm flaming fast
That nigga jumped up and did the Damon Dash




Yeah, yeah, a special guest appearance
From the slums.... yo, aiyo


I examine your diameter, third eye light the camera up
Be careful, I got four ninjas, inside your parameter
Perimeter, flame burst out all sides like Gamora
My poisonous is released, gas from the canister
Raise the black fist, we keep the earth on it's axis
I make a good day move slow like molasses
Welcome to the bee hive, dual processor with the G5
There's not a tape or disco break I can't revive
In this high tech world of fire wire and microchip
We still keep the four-five clip, filled with the spiral tip


I come from the 36 Chambers of danger
With many lyrical swordsmen, that quick to change ya
The difficulty to see closely, is mostly
It's a critical point, when ya rap niggas approach me
Like the blind, deaf, dumb, who mind was left numb
A non B-Boy nigga, couldn't rhyme to the drum
When I started M.C.'ing I entered, the gates of pleasure
Not knowing, I be coming with, too much to measure
With the math of an elder, and the steel of a welder
The path of tray, that I had laid down, to held a
Blueprint, that would draw attention like the Pope
I examine all with the internal mirror of the scope


Supreme deluxe edition, CREAM with a touch of wisdom
Beams that through up the system, spleens, I conduct, you listen
How you gonna tell me no, yo, the fuck you is in
Locked in a four block radius like a public prison
Twenty two year old, dunn, ain't got a cup to piss in
But he got a barrel gun, and that's knuckle twitching
And he got a baby moms and a cousin bitching
Went to catch a body, now he stuck in another prison


When you see it, you better acknowledge, your all swords
Blaze the green hundred fours
Pull out on you, blew you for the cause
And Sudan outst a nigga, seclude you from my Clan
This is water Glock, aces on cameras sniffin' raw
Why try to fuck with these lecturers
I'm so high powered, my electrical structure blew down the floor
You was king for a second, I reigned, came with a different name
The W.T.C. Family and more, one!


They applause when I make my entrance
I move on 'em with age and experience, before I start the sentence
The rhyme was designed to meet most demand
Is enough to compensate, fertilize the land
He blew out the belt drive, M.C.'s they felt vibes
Powerful dart, narrowly missing your whole tribe
Scientists look, at the magnitude and devastation
But the strands of heavy metal seem to have no relation
But it's always potential for large scale disasters
Because the instrumentals, spins a hundred times faster
Many was taken, is at the price of a pawn
And the collective lost had left, thousand of mourn
Them Clansmen, are the nucleus of hip-hop
There's no room for error, M.C.'s will get dropped
Evidence of terrifying threats from heat pressure
Power by strong winds that blew rhymes off the dresser
The words spread through the town from Yonkers to Leffers
And to kill off the slang was a city wide effort
But they couldn't be more wrong, my click was all strong
Fit together seamlessly, til you're all gone


The queen by far, is the strongest piece
Should too, should not be prematurely brought
Into play, during in the opening
Or she will be attacked by wicked pieces
And driven back, it is very dangerous
To make a raid with the queen early on in the game
It is best, in opening, to make but one move with the queen
And that, to a square where she is not exposed
To any direct or indirect attack




"Yo, check this out, my name is the Ol' Dirty Bastard
Youknowhatimsayin, when I rhyme, when I, when I get down for my crown
I come out crazy like a, like a tiger, or something, knowhatimsayin
No, no, nobody can even F' with me, straight up and down
You knowhatimsayin', so that's how we coming in, knowhatimsayin?"
From the heart of Medina, to the head, to the east
To the plaza houses, a/k/a the Mountain
To the rugged lands of Shaolin, yo
We rock all, all, all in together now
Got played, got fresh, up---


The world was bugging off this Wu-Tang nigga on the rock
That was just another spot on the muthafuckin' block
You forgot Cash Rule nigga? Toss seven figures
He pull a trigger to make that account, get bigger
Had babies to feed, kept a bitch with need
Thousands shows booked, promoters on speed
His hands was in everything, including some pussy
From the Brazilian wax, to the uncombed bushy
From down state, psychiatric
Who tried to put a code on his brain until he cracked it
Now the media wanna view him like they knew him
And his head nurse, wanna sue him cause she blew him
Ever since he walked on stage, he was just a loose cannon
Wild drunk staggerin', nigga who kept standin'
Class clown, who erase chalk from the board
The only choir member, that sing off chord, we were


(All, all, all in together now)
Kept the balance, stay dressed for the weather now
Battle M.C.'s, anywhere, whatever town
And remain victorious, in any ground


The All In Together Now, started in Bed-Stuy
Human beatbox specialist, who dressed fly
A half ounce of blow and a forty ounce drinker
Magnificent flow, critical thinker
Unique is one grain of sand from the beach
And had bitches eating out of his hand
He was intelligent, his style was relevant
I can name ten niggas that stole an element
From the high speed chase to the court arraignments
All of the above, was entertainment
He caused earthquakes, just from experiments
Some thoughts got lost, not knowing where it went
His songs had a rep for many inducements
Giving birth to new styles, after recruitments
There's no replacement or any supplement
He was a new testament, what he said, what he meant, we were




The judge took a look at he, and threw the book at thee
The sentencing, would have made the average crook happy
They put him in a box, wrapped like a gift
In them straight jacket, watched by two, worked the shift
Gave him no phone calls, saw no sunlight
Like, Billie the Kid, in his last gun fight
Then days became weeks, weeks became months
Carved the calendar on the wall, with his fronts
The food pushed in, on the trays, looking sharp, in the cell
By hands covered with latex gloves
Cooks in the kitchen had laced his drinks
The wild ass physician, they was off the breaks
He got visits from shrinks who came in with ink-blots
Moving with they own plot, but the Dirt, he think not
He had nothing but time on his hands
As if he got a sign from the Clan, we were




All, all, all, in together now
"All in together now!" - Ol' Dirty Bastard
"All in together now!"
All, all, all, in together now
"All in together now!"
"All in together now!"
"All in together now!"
"All in together now!"
"All in together now!"
"All in together now!"
"Now white doesn't really wanna use up his few remaining pawn moves, so he plays king to e2"




All I need is a beat, with a continuous loop
And a live vibe, that'll hypnotize like the flute
Along with something that's rugged by nature like the forest
Composed like the symphony without a chorus
A place with the path and trail that you follow
With the wood, where you drive your nails, but too hollow
Far from reality, with a slim chance of getting back
Even if you narrowly escape the hidden traps
Nothing but the driven raps written in my notebook
Inspired by the cap and the gown, that's on the coat hook
Prepare for the chemical rush, something new to cause
Your heart to bass, but it's tangable to touch
Associate with those who are consumed with beats
Produce fire, until they melt the room with heat
You know my ink lay all over the sheets, let us/letters gather around
And form words, everytime they meet


Allah Be a Born, Cee Divine, Equality
Father, then after that, there's the G-O-D
He or Her, I Islam, then Justice
King of Kingdom, Love, Hell or Right, we still exist
Master, Now in Cypher/O, Power's the Queen
Rule of Rulers, Self of Save, the Truth of the square, the same
Universe, Victory, Wisdom, Unknown/X, Why/Y
Zig Zag Zig, and now we're back home


I brought butter for the popcorn, dip for the chips
And ego for your trip, some scripts for you to flip
Corrections for mishaps, errors, or mistakes
Fly raps for beats, and pop and lock for breaks
A legend in my own lifetime, from one rhyme
That was specially designed, from the hook to bottom line
Shine's like a precious jewel, cut up in the workshop
With specialized handcrafted tools
Couldn't buy this hardware, so don't swipe your card there
Better yet, fold your hand, cuz you holding the wrong pair
One hit wonders, get a little shine like flashlights
But when I drop the bomb and explode like gas pipes
A livewire, known as the dragon that spit fire
Verbal action, hot as the grease from deep fryers
Delivered in the perfect pitch, because hip hop
Is all in my genes/jeans, the pattern is seen in every stitch






The amplified sample, will trample, delete and cancel
That vacate your vessel
Guide this, strenuous as an arm wrestle
Move swift as light, a thousand years in one night
In flight with insight
Everything I thought of, I saw it happen
Then I rose from the soil, the sun blackened
Then came rap czars, left tracks in scars
Apparent brightness of exploding stars
Gave you goods to taste
No ingredients to trace
You remain stuck trying to figure the shape of space
No edge or boundary, release 2 rounds or 3
Intimidate, my razor scrape phony clown MC
The physical shatter from the blast
Pyroclastic flow, sets forth a tower of ash
Through ignorance and misplaced trust your world's crushed
Too late to activate hyperspatial thrust
Even wearing camouflage, you're analog
At war, the scene is high beams and fog
I came in accompanied by deadly rain and wind
Mentally endowed with lightning, hit the crowd
The warm side edge across the barrier
But the storm tide destroyed your area




The amplified sample, will trample, delete and cancel
That vacate your vessel
The amplified sample, the amplified sample, the amplified sample
Will trample
The amplified sample, will trample, delete and cancel
That vacate your vessel
The amplified, the amplified sample
The amplified sample, the amplified
The amplified sample, will trample, delete and cancel
The amplified
The amplified sample, will trample, delete and cancel
The amplified, the amplified
The amplified sample (fade out)




Welcome to the Jungle where the cat loves to scratch, the rat squeals
And the polar bear feasts on the blubber of seals
The pack of wolves be scheming on a bunch of gazelles
Where the leopards grab the wildebeest down by it's tail
You see the chimps they grow hemps they hustle and sling in trees
Elephants for security that move tons of leaves
The bluebirds arrest parrots that love to talk
Or eagles that stalk fresh-water trout under the wing of the hawk
You see the vultures pick the pocket of whatever remain
In the brain we watch but a shadow of the lion's mane
Whose roar is loud enough to take the stripes from a zebra
He camouflage his bets and his spots of a cheetah
Shouldn't gamble with a cheetah and not expect to get beat
You silly goose you know he move fast on his feet
Now you're neck deep in debt with a bunch of loan sharks
So you move on a colony of ants with aardvarks, you see
Most of the everglades controlled by the gators
It was crashed by the crocs who came years later
See the locusts had swarmed with the bees
The tick moved with the fleas
The dragonflies and the wasps shared with the seas
The crab and the leeches sucked your blood flow
And they laugh like hyenas when they out to catch dough
See a million mosquitos from the West now
Carrying the virus that made the boars less wild


It's like the jungle sometimes


Out of fear of the deer watch for the eye of the tiger
The Clutch from the Cobra and the venomous viper
Boa-constrictors that cut your circulation
Mosts of their prayers die from broke bones and suffocation
The owls are private eyes that watch from the bark
Black panthers are the militant who strike in the dark
Porcupines had a rep' for sticking everything that moved
In areas that the rhinos and hippos approved
And the giraffe was a look-out for gorillas in the mist
And the bats use their sonar to guide and assist
Those pelicans who smuggle contraband for the whale
While the skunks spray the scent to keep the dogs off the trail
The scorpion set up a sting for sly foxes
That use stool pigeons just to keep them in the boxes
While the black widow
Laid a web for the bachelor
Like daddy-long-leg and his hype man, tarantula
They both prey on grasshoppers beetles and flies
And they all become instant meals the moment it dies
What costs little, is a little worth
So some lose they lives wandering on the wrong turf
From birth they grow up walking the thin line
It's like the jungle sometimes


It's like the jungle sometimes



(come on in)

Dinn-dnn-dnn-ta-dnn
(come on in)
Dinn-dnn-ta-dnn, dinn DNN DAH
(come on, come on, come on in)
Dnn-da-duh-duh-DAH, you BITCH ASS niggas!
(come on in, come on, come on, come on in)


As high as Wu-Tang get
Allah allow us pop this shit
Just like black shoe fit
If you can't wear it, well don't fuck with it!


Yo, too many songs, weak rhymes that's mad long
Make it brief Son, half short and twice strong
No doubt, it took time searchin, eventually
It was prime urgent, for you to examine the rhyme merchant
Lace MC's with styles when they rhyme drunk
On a label hunt, until twenty thou, out the trunk
Eight Diagram sword swinga armored tank force
RZA throw in the disc but then change the bank source
You can't flow, must be the speech impediment
You got lost off the snare off Impeach the President
Whether in Amsterdam smokin seven grams of green
Then you pack, a thousand white teens in tight jeans
This Witty Unpredictable shot is critical
To analytical analogy, insurance policies why
Said he know that sounds define the note
Couldn't recognize, blast him the fuck behind the ropes
Too many dope niggas I see starvin
Catch a single deal, a possible plea bargain
Wu slay regardles to whom or what, five mics five nights
Hang him from the balcony, drop twenty-five flights
A fugitive bass playin rap czar
Smoke the cigars, his prints on the strings of his guitar


As high as Wu-Tang get
Allah allow us pop this shit
Just like black shoe fit
If you can't wear it, well don't fuck with it!


Tical got a hold on ya, doin exactly
What the fuck I mariju-wanta, dis nigga nasty
Deep in the dirty dungeon, buggin, lovin
The ways these rhymes keep comin, at cha splash ya
Get your head piece fractured, with killer cuts
From the Shropshire Slasher, rip shit up
Got this whole thing Tang mastered, sho nuff
An MC too good to be touched, John John
Bring the phenomenon, I cold crush
MC, inferiorities they froze up, ice cold
As we move on, saga unfold
Captivated by a saga that go untold, like Goldfinger
Caught up in a cliffhanger
Yo I-N-S another code red, danger, break out the vest
Now it's tactical warfare, it's all here
Come with your shield and hardware, it be on here
Don't ever roam, in the naked city
Eight million stories none pretty
Bomb em wit the Witty Unpredictable
Conditionin' be critical
Peace to Tang, gettin high on your physical, dis next drink
Is a toast to your memory
When I go how many niggas gon' remember me


As high as Wu-Tang get
Allah allow us pop this shit
Just like black shoe fit
If you can't wear it, well don't fuck with it!




The RZA, the GZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Inspectah Deck
Raekwon the Chef, U-God, Ghostface Killah, Masta Killa
And the Me --- yeah, yeah, come on, now, now


What's happening? Who get it cracking like a neck snapping
For the rapping, and who them fellas packing yelling Staten
From the background, I'll back down a few
Try to clown us in the past, where they at now?
I'm ill as baby powder with the smackdown, for the record
My brain is like the project projected, for the Method
Go see my nigga Kush, he got the best shit for burning
This one go out for whom it may concerning
Spending they entire earning, trynna get a higher learning
MC's is vermin, like E be Sermon
Ya'll too determined, feeling yaself like Pee-Wee Herman
While we at it, let's tighten up our grips around that cabbage
Silly rabbits, how many kids'll trick you out your carrots
Ghetto bastards and ghetto bitches, I break you like a bad habit
My dick is two inches too big for it's britches
Uh, so fuck a mister and your misses
Cottonmouth niggas X'ed out like Merry Christmas, that all
Uh-huh, be home

*bell rings*


Knock, knock, who is it, Tical I pop digit
My block too hot to visit, round here, you gots to live it
MC's, you must admit it, I'm deadly on this mic like
Anthrax on this premise, anyone of ya'll can get in
I breathe, Backwoods sleeves and THC
I bleed, kamikazes and forty OZ's
America's Most, the better the smoke, the better the quotes
For cheddar, Meth'll sever the throat, whatever the coast
I'm home, let the sun shine on, get his grind on
And get some phone time, everytime I'm in your timezone
Look here, it's crooked letter I, ya'll don't meet nothing but crooks here
It's hot in hell's kitchen, get your cookware, for goodness
MC's is like that shit chicks be gushing
For pushing, got me tooken down to Central Booking
I stick out, as if Tical just walked up in the party with my dick out
And I'm prepared to take the shit I dish out

"When you realize that what you got ain't what you want" - sample


On the, yo, on the expressway, suddenly, I, um, hit the breaks
A mistake, patrol figure just, ran the plates
I pull to the shoulder, a half mile ahead
The vibe got colder when the marksman said
"Yo, you in the truck, get the fuck out your car
Put your hands where my eyes could see, not far"
A fat slob, with pepperspray in the canister
Donut shop lounger, nine mil brandisher
Plus my half pound just rang the bell
Of the bloodhound, had an acute sense of smell
I guess he was tired of the strip and booking whores
Moving off a tip he's claimed he's looking for
Some MC's wanted for a string of break-ins
Last seen wearing long minks and snakeskins




Associated with metal detectors, loud mouth show-off
To stand out like bite reflected
Words to vibrate like the bass guitar
With the least amount of weight, you should replace a bar
You can tempt me, with looseleaf paper that's empty
I write it in a code, for your average DaVinci
From the era of the REC Room and cassette tapes
Putting empty, rhyme on anything except greats
Too tech mix lay pararrel, the place got marks
On the spot, move around like parasail
The sight sailed obscene, testing ground for new theories
Cuz some DJ's formed the team
Torrential down pour, you hear the sound, more
Nature's fury, and this town is bound for
Hip hop, most violent, most beautiful
Wind gusts, from Justice scenes in the musical


The blade runner, face gunner, mace never cold case
Kept a base stretcher, erase your bass set-up
Freestyles wet up, written, hit your kitchen ketchup
Mass grown, hand feets'll shout, whatever the weather
Body white, sheet stretcher, mic aim leary's atcha
Rapture rhyme graphter, smash the camera
Arm & Hammer hand jammers, slam-a-grammer, Ghost standard
Everything you touch turn Bronze, I'm like the old stanza
Handle vine cables, swing 'em like Tarzan
Divine rhyme plant pay you, digits to farlands
Peace to my cousin, who smoking clouds, open house
Prepare once a month in the Source, like the menstrual's out
Guns accumulate, devout, get my pension with the pencil out
Thoughts stench on my potential droughts
Resume the rain, no matter the windchill
I make you think, still Detroit/Killah Hill
Deeply my footprints build for bodies to feel
Raised by the dumpsters, black, the Zombie-ville
Gun Rule burglars, with murderers masks
Known to filter out the snakes that be burning the grass


Associated with black steel, in the hour of chaos
Unreal, like niggas in the seance
Some say I, and grab you with the pen
If you murder the king, I live forever in the end
I've been evil, through the eye of a needle
Just when I grab the steel, as black as Don Cheadle
Feeble and weak, I peep Samson niggas
Revolution come, I pull hair and then triggers
Invented the cause, when pause was indented
Face the follow leads, the flame, my mind painted
John Lennon gats, clapping out of my window
Lay low, one shotty, loo the lasso


I snap shop, pop out like Polaroids
So wild, we still riot like the middle of Detroit
The SWAT, South West A-Team, the block
Do say, when grace hip hop, the Beijing around-the-way cops
Hold me in, like rhyme flicks, phoned in
Still pitched dope, any zip code I'm in
Capture the souls of men, and women alike
Last flow, pin the mic, begin to strike
It ain't no slouchers here, we out this year
Ya'll about that, we about this here
From small cats to the top, in here
Got cares, like we really got a option here
Going all out, GZA on board, now we pedalling
Mainstream, the model still CREAM, that's how we handle shit


Niggas just actors, not really factors
Putting on shows in the street, that bring laughter
What happen to the jabbers, uppercut, scrappers
Confrontation now, bring nothing but gun clappers
Stains on the conrete, blood on the mattress
Mind runs deep like the Nile going backwards
Hip hop dead? Then I'm here to resurrect it
Big Daddy shit, with the "Kane", I'm an expert
"No Half Steppin'", break show amazing
Mad situations, leave the gun blazing
Seeing Vietnam through the eyes of an Asian
Cold hearted lungs, but my tongue spit Cajun




I was born, with the mic in my hand
Then I took it from Medina, to the S.I. land
I pulled up on the block, go out the truck
It was the first of pit stops
The era of the spinnin' tops, the birth of hip hop
That was somethin', I had identified with
So I, made it my point to exploit this fly gift then
Myself and RZA, made trips to the B.X
A mass of ferocious M.C.'s and talent T-Rex
Giants in every ways, rap flows for every day
We knew we would get a reward for the price we'll pay
The basic training was beyond entertainment
Just the cadence of the verbal expressions, self explainin'
Wore my boots out in constant walks across the borough
Tore the troops out the frame when they challenge the most thorough
From well concealed firing positions we let off the most
Dangerous with that, slang that just shatter the coast
They say I rhyme like the bank that stop
Cause M.C.'s be more shook than the dice that drop
Especially if I'm rollin', then the point is definitely proven
Cause with the GZA holdin', that keep a nigga movin'
I walk Broadway, from Quincy to Myrtle
Back to Quincy, cut careers whatever the expense be
They heard the Legend, run to the reverend
With headaches and blackouts, worse then severe seven


And when my job is done
And it's time to get those that's comin' up some runs
So you can see where they from, from, from...
They say the product is good
We gonna sling it from the slums of the hills of the hood
'Til it's understood


We still search through the crates of songs that just breaks
At times we play legendary battles on tapes
Unlikely confrontation with a clash of swords
In a G that was stored, be rain that just poured
On cats and dogs, water that, flooded the stance
The violence and nature had trigged the violence of man
That was bloodshed, from which said, audible threats
Publicize regrets, wanted alive or dead
A hand full recovered from the dramatic plunge
While the rest kept babblin' and speakin' in tongues
Since the competition already slayed them in a scrimmage
He continued tarnish that, already faded image
Any sport, when they come short, majors don't need 'em
Then they broke, lose they homes, lively hood and freedom
The rhyme could be a blunt object that make you choke
Like too many tokes, that'll recharge in growth
This Witty Unpredictable Talent or Natural Game
With non added of slang, it's all actual fact
The high roller knock the chip off the shoulder
Strike like the perfect bowler, with catastrophic damage
My other's hard to vanish, punishment, swift to sudden
Unparalleled advantage, brought to a level where you froze and can't speak
Trapped in the frigid temperatures of that peak






Light is shinin.. beauty sunshine
Here comes one-time.. the ball was so fine
Heat is blazin.. the kids were playin
His partner was shady.. tryin to save the babies


A-yo, they didn't know the cop was crooked
He had blow out in Brooklyn
All this while he let the fiends cook it
The baseheads stirred it up, plus they got to blow it up
Dropped it off in the PJ's and they bigged it up
Then one day, shit jumped off real crazy
The middle of a bathroom they find an old lady
No clothes, half of her tongue, ear missin
The killer had to be mad smart, he wore mittens
Even though her leg was bitten
Crackheads point the finger at Detective Slick Morris Gittins
Paleface cop who done popped the best
And got the chop on his neck from when he knocked Celeste
It was a slug, drug, he pressured everybody on the block
Some niggas know him as the Godson of Gotti
And his black partner, he was scared to speak
He saw how they planted weapons on these kids in the street
He saw like over fifty bodies in like fifty-two weeks
He saw his colleague pick up money before leavin his beat
They call him desk duty, Robocop
Younger dudes call him Freddy Krugs from the way he walk on the block




Heard the disturbance out the window, oh shit they got my son
Pulled over his Tempo, Brenda dropped the endo
Had her little nephew with her yo she didn't care
They always harassed her, until she blew the captain with a razor
His partner turned red in his waist, maced her, smacked her
With the walkie, yoked her then slammed her on her face
He bugged on her like she was drugged, plugged one in her
The fifth relaxed her like a big thug pistol whipped her
Heard she was dusted, must've been the way they threw the cuffs on her
She broke the shits, went and rushed the kid
Wavin her hands, she had a half an axe, all in her tracks
He grabbed her by the hair, she broke his jaw it cracked
More cops arrived, they both bloodied down by the five
Wildest niggas just smilin cause it look live
They gave her forty years in New Orleans, callin me wodie
Shorty was young, by three days had a great bid




You're just worms in the worst part of the apple that's rotten
You squirm and you turn from the right, still plottin
All slimy cause you stay grimy, petty crimey cat
You sometime me, don't need to remind me about
Livin in the core, with the scramblers in front of the store
The bum holdin the door, the mugging no one saw
We played ball in the alley where dope was shot raw
And the school they kept flawed, plus the lowest test scores
Small percentage determined to strengthen they position
Transformation from critical to, stable condition
But it still be obstacles on niggas that's optical
Watchin you like salt-water sharks that's tropical
The money was the root and it's the instinct to make it
With they pockets and fridge naked, many aim to take it
Whether - hold up, set up, stabbin or a wet up
Just to know it was the kid next door fizzucked your head up
Once he fell short, frequently visit the courts
And for some, another way out, is music and sports
That's why I, keep the rhyme just as fly as a shot
That won the championship, with just oh on the clock

 - repeat 2X




On a man-made lake there's a sheet of thin ice
Where unskilled skaters couldn't figure-8 twice
That's sixteen uncut direct from the cult
Head on assault, the result death by the bulk
In a vault, they spoke about the average loss per mission
That was seen by a king in a prophetic vision
Like a plane crash from a bomb blast
Special broadcast, slot time with con cash
They kept the jury quiet and now the riot will form
While satanic man now hang in his dorm
I swing on you fake radio personalities
Who boost ya ratings with hypes behind casualties
And fire shots with low-pressure water gun play
But instantly slap ya five like it's Palm Sunday
I fashion the first tool, from the elements the Earth use
And built it to a complex network of communications
You're up against a hopeless situation
I screen every vehicle from enemy observation
Swarming unpredictably, we spread terror
Increase the fog significantly, change the era
Check my wind pattern, it's heading west
Success is freedom but failure can mean death
Humans sweat and aim shovels, dig up the debris and rubble
Permanent damage caused by the W
Now who cowardly urge you to merge through
And think the workers will serve you?
The Sonic marvel who just dropped the next novel
Worldwide, rapidly marred in marble
It's a countless amount of emcees I saved
And them same niggas wanna squander those gifts I gave


Scratch underneath the surface, where does your purpose lie?
It seems our will is worthless, like we're pawns beneath the sky
Fates erased by reason and passion's just a whim
Feel empty so I breath in, keep myself from giving in


Love and hatred, moments most sacred
Both species, they lay naked in the tombs of oasis
Think back on niggas I ate with, spent the day with
Guns we played with, niggas I relate with
We broke bread, I heard through a vine niggas worked for the Fed
Sent out secretly to take my head
I laid back and meditate to the words they said
Skipped town for a month and grew some dreads
Had a friend tell my family I was dead
Returned at the last fall of the autumn leaf
Operate the plan accordingly in case the Feds are recording me
Sign all documents using forgery cause just a mere thought of me
I'm like Solomon, spoke bluntly, told the world, "I'm black and comely"
Howls from the grave haunt me, the smell of death's upon me
I dwell in the Hills like Gandhi
Been in the presence of mad peasants and old kings
Who sold everything on a quest for God's Divine
Slept in caves to get a clear mind
Who prayed three times, when the Moon lit and when the Sun rise
I met dwellers in the desert, talked to shepherds
Been in the mouth of many leopards
Felt the death kiss of Satan's mistress
Walk through vacant districts, before religions I studied pagan scriptures
True philosophers and physicians on the cure missions
Who harden their hearts toward the weak, sick and inflicted
Candles lit, gamble with a bitch
Who made me love her when I touch her, soft paws hide claws
Bees with sweet honey in they mouth
Have bitter stingers at they tail
Walk through the chambers of death, take a hole onto Hell
Embracing her was like embracing the third rail




Scratch underneath the surface




Yeah, Perverted Monk representin
YouknowhatI'msayin?


No need for cappin this
Brave boys, I break your back with this
Practice, math this, lyrical theatrics
You'll never, ever, brave the weather, I'm too clever
Conjurin Sandstorms, I'll freeze ya, then I'll melt ya
You know I dealt the, on impact, shots hit the ceiling
These lyrics, I'm wieldin, straight echoes through the building
Enemies efforts are foreseen in the mental
I make steel wrinkle at the blink of an eye
Terminate unrighteous conscious states
Imitate the stars, while they constelate
The heart rate, of my social eloquence, makes sense
Intense, with the roughage, you couldn't budge this
Mountainous, type of figure
So check it out, now you know
When you lookin at a real nigga


You know we rip it up, hit the mic like a virus
We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle, which rapper thinkin they the nicest
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless


You eggshell niggas get cracked in half
My armed force throw a road block in your path
Beats smash, from True Mast, my shots blast
Shatter glass, crowd watch the sound sets clash
Quick fast, I let the darts off, with no doubt
Your bitch ass, you head north and break out
Snakes out, hissin, shots missin
Observe, and respect and listen
And if you get stung twice, that means he's rollin wit loaded dice
It's like gettin stabbed with ice, and watch the evidence melt
Immediately the blow is felt
Commissioner revoke the belt, the microphone
Microphone flow-er, fresh show-er
Of the rugged garments, break the bread like Noah
I'm holdin, ride the 808 Roland
Write til my hand's swollen, your no comp ya
Huh, I stomp ya, the monster
Worldwide record launcher, multiply and conquer




Nemesis, bringer of disaster
With more moves then the Tai Chi Master
Killa and I get illa, cerebral warlord
My name's Afu-Ra, step too quick, and your thought's floored
Fury portrayed, sharper than a fuckin cactus
Conquerin globes, and universes with Galactus
Tongue lashes, it rattles, never sliver
Optimus Prime, fatal bites as I deliver
Lyrically deadly, mic flow heavenly
In dwellin intelligence, choose my weaponry
Battle strategy, bishop cover angles
Knights move next, L shapes the vortex
Forces break down, now I got the nitty gritty
You think it's a stalemate, but now I'm yellin checkmate
Ultra rhymer, stop breaths like anacondas






Before space and time, thought produced a speck of light
It was infinitely hot, so extremely bright
Within the center of this great shining
It was massive energy and it was expanding in great timing
Within this fireball was all of space of every special place with information encased
Literally, a beginning
This cosmic clock was ticking and allowed space to flow while it was spinning
Everything we see around us
The sun, the moon, the stars, millions of worlds that astound us
The universe inside is hard to fathom
It was composed in a region small as a single atom
Less than one trillionth the size the point of a pen
Microscopic but on a macro level within
Unfurling this swirling cloud of light
A star city, a galaxy with all its might
Within the blinking of an eye expanding beyond comprehension
Within a fraction of a second a new dimension
At a marble size very unstable
In time it would come with a periodic table


You see, space was expanding faster than light speed
It moving at the rate only thought can exceed
A picosecond after the Big Bang
Music of the spheres before the ears, the Universe is now sang
Small enough to fit in your hand, a nanosecond later
It was the size of Mars and becoming greater
Fraction of a second later 80 times the size of Earth
Fastest growing infant since the time of birth
Still expanding but it didn't contain matter
Just pure energy that was mixing within the batter
But mass and energy interchangeable
Convert those particles rearrange-able
Matter and anti-matter, the archrival
Met, obliterated each other for survival
A war zone, a battle to the death
But as long as there is life and breath there's one remaining left




The rain came to my treetop
And it washed away oh so many things
Things I couldn't learn till I went through
Things I didn't know until I met you


Now I'm learning the hard way
Learning the hard way
Learning the hard way to be true
Now I'm learning the hard way
That birds of a father will rock together
And if we got a problem we'll talk together
So let's head down south just leave for fair weather
Oh oh, oh oh
That birds of a father will rock together
And if we got a problem we'll talk together
So let's head down south just leave for fair weather
Oh oh, oh oh


They say the early bird gets the worm
Cause he never has to fight for the crumbs and then take flight and turn
Especially the thousand up in the tree all whistling
A natural alarm clock for those who's listening
The melody is music to the ear
The vibrational effect has already set, I use it like it's gear
Some like to spread their wings and go skydiving
Razor sharp talents, they snatch things and seek hiding
King's sight even at great heights
Moving with the wind of the day and up in the nest at late night
A few presidents use feathers for ink pens
They sign on the dotted line and that's where the link ends


That birds of a father will rock together
And if we got a problem we'll talk together
So let's head down south just leave for fair weather
Oh oh, oh oh
That birds of a father will rock together
And if we got a problem we'll talk together
So let's head down south just leave for fair weather
Oh oh, oh oh




Breaker, breaker one nine, clear the line
Can you read me? Shortage on rhymes
MCs should expect the worst
I stay alert and shoot first


This is not a test, it's difficulty
Picture closely, the ignorant mostly
Blind, deaf, dumb, your mind left numb
Lost soul who failed to hear the roll of the drum
In the bottom of your bomb shelter, still felt the
Heavy blast that blew off the masks of twelve welders
The math of an elder, praise the Lord, thank you Genius
Operation: Project English
Commander the chief of flight style, check the aircraft
Glide like the Frisbee, Digi they Disney
To check fault in oneself is pure loveliness
You break the mirror that remind you of your ugliness
So when I bust, no one is untouched
Some returning with the mic clutched, like such
Who plan but never execute
He had the heat in his hand, but yo he didn't shoot
Therefore your mechanism of material better be sickly
Or let your lead spread incredibly quickly
I move bravely, travellin' on a horse
On the battlefield, surrounded by the lost
Of those who plotted with the brains of animals
My high molecular structure be untangible
The name ring a bell, killable two syllable
The Wu is comin' through, the outcome is critical
To be blunt, the beat was cooked up like coke goods
The rhyme first came to me in the oak woods
Up to no good, rap icon
Milk the industry like the Wall Street junk bond
You see the bright stone, I got your height sewn
Direct current, that move through the mic-phone
Key contributor, well-known major factor
Rhyme distributor, the drive of a tractor
Who run ya down if you don't move or wanna linger {*echoes*}




The immortality of my fame is the measure of other's torture
Burnt offer, from a flamin' author
The falconer who flies enough birds for the chase
Strictly excel in what is excellence with grace
The significance was not the vulgar applause of interest
But the feelin' that exit, completion of a sentence
With age and experience, my reason ripens
I strike on you Vikings, slash like a hyphen
If you enter the house of fortune by the gate of pleasure
You will leave by sorrow, the flow measures
Everything fails with the unfortunate
Learned that recordin' it, so my mind broaden it
Track records ranks us with the exceptional
Extreme complex physics, high technical
The truth is usually seen and rarely heard
What's more dangerous than hatred is the word
You wild cards, jack of all trades
Those who parade their positions show their spades
A large flock of MCs, they figure to be taught
It ain't hard to see why I'm vigorously sought




Breaker breaker one nine
Breaker breaker one nine




Come and get some, you want none
Y'all niggas wanna bring it, get done
Flashback, '88 rag type Volvo
One court solo, slash for logo
200 hyenas roam the arena
Schemin on a truck Chevy, quick to rush every
Criminal mental, satanic pen pal
Wild style on your wax for ten thou'
Most notable, Hip Hop quotable
See many went, only one got a show to do
Floor soakin wet with the drinks and dance sweat
Tell me which click got the deadliest handset
I make the mic pump, force make your feet stomp
Murderous beats move like rope for you to jump
And the two-inch, tighten with the wool-wrench
None qualifyin ass-niggas, the Jon Bentz
Spend it real, 'nuff festivals on the grill
Got a deal, no return with the Brook Shield


Breaker, Breaker 1-9, can't rhyme
Y'all niggas wanna shine, get offline


Yo, I use and abuse all groups and crews
I can't lose, straight up and down, I'm bad news
Like the bears, we folks from under the stairs
Pack a hand trigga, scared niggas don't dare
From the rear, I smash through like a John Deer
Plant a bomb in ya ear then disappear
With a speed that'll reach mach five
Niggas pop jive, that's why they on the opposite side
Dick riders tryin to make their way inside
Boy analyze, my camp be amplified
Certified live, right before your third-eye
Supply the mental high for the fiendish
Thru the intervenus, see it like a wide-screen Zenith
Got sweetness, wanna show me your cleavage
Leave it to the specialist, leave your wig split
Leavin no witness, it's a mean business
We mean business, invest in cream
Till my exit scene, I stay plottin on my next scheme


Next scheme
Blessed with the art to pierce and shoot dart
I toke the bass, put your shovel to the Rebel
Allah Just, embrace his face with the metal
Danger, woman adore to the chamber
Let this nigga run out wild with the banger
Hip Hop socialize, enterprise, snubs in the club
Twenty wizards, about 300 niggas inching your square
Or could it be the armory?
Fifty-two low hand, touch the ground
Strike his knee, pass the heat to my man
Windmill backhand bust your nose gland
Mic stand, might crash a wild fan
The Aqua, city of Atlantis, mantis, flying locusts
Surround the oppose, a bomb only has one time to explode
I blow and break and quake your whole state
Throw the shit on DAT, and make me a fuckin tape






"Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu-Tang sword style. If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous. Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?"
"En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style."


Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!


Ghostface catch the blast of a hype verse
My Glock burst, leave in a hearse, I did worse
I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk
Your head rush, fly like Egyptian musk
Aww shit, Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks, and
However I master the trick just like Nixon
Causin' terror, quick damage your whole era
Hardrocks is locked the fuck up or found shot
P.L.O. style, hazardous 'cause I wreck this
Dangerous, I blow spots like Waco, Texas


I watch my back like I'm locked down
Hardcore-hittin' sound
Watch me act bugged and tear it down
Illiterate-type asshole, songs goin' gold
No doubt, and you watch a corny nigga fold
Yeah, they fake and all that, carryin' gats
But yo, my Clan rollin' like forty macks
Now you act convinced, I guess it makes sense
Wu-Tang, yo, soooo represent!
I wait for one to act up, now I got him backed up
Gun to his neck now, react what?
And that's one in the chamber
Wu-Tang banger, 36 styles of danger


Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!

I rip it hardcore, like porno-flick bitches
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's bangin'
Wu-Tang slang'll leave your headpiece hangin'
Bust this, I'm kickin' like Seagal: out for justice
The roughness, yes, the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder one, my style shock your knot like a stun-gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty-ass nigga, with my nigga the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pulled like a trigger
So bad, stabbin' up the pad with the vocab, crab
I scream on your ass like your dadbring it on!


Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!


Yo, I'm more rugged than slaveman boots
New recruits, I'm fuckin' up MC troops
I break loose, and trample shit, while I stomp
A mudhole in that ass 'cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creepin' up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin' through your back *swish*
Givin' bystanders heart-attacks
Niggas try to fliptell me, who is him?
I blow up his fuckin' prism
Make it a vicious act of terrorism
You wanna bring it, so fuck it
Come on and bring the ruckus!
And I provoke niggas to kick buckets
I'm wettin' cream, I ain't wettin' fame
Who sellin' cain? I'm givin' out a deadly game
It's not the Russian, it's the Wu-Tang crushin' roulette
Slip up and get fucked like Suzette
Bring da fuckin' ruckus!


Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!

"En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style."

Something new from my real live raps and so catch this
While I kick a verse like chapters
I'm all of that, proceed with the militant act
With the rugged Timberlands or with boots that's black
But on the real, I'm cold like blue steel
Out to catch a hit and make a mill, chill
Maintain yourself Black, you're strapping all of that
But you ain't got shit in this shack Jack
That's my word, I'm used to beef and I can eat it mad raw
And pick it out my gold teeth
But yo back to the subject, Wu's trying to get wrecked yo
Pass the weed thru your shit god mic check, need a little meth yo
True, back to me flipping you and your so called zoo
You got nothing on a nigga from Staten
A drunk monk, smoking mad skunk and stacking
I didn't need rap shit to get me on, I was a crimey
Driving a Benz hearing my man's song
And when shit gone broke out, everybody got smoked out
And cops drove the wrong route
Don't act evil and possess to hurt me, forty guns be flowing in your face
Who wants some




I rip it hardcore, like porno-flick bitches
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's banging
Wu-Tang slang'll leave the microphone hanging

The roughness, yes the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder one, my style shot your knot like a stun-gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigger
So bad, stabbing up the pad with the vocab, crab
I scream on your ass like your dad, bring it on




Yo, I'm more rugged than slaveman boots
New recruits, I'm fucking up MC troops
I break loops, and trample shit, while I stomp
A mudhole in that ass, cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creeping up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fucking dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Chopping through your back
Giving bystanders heart-attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me who is him
I blow up his fuckin prism
Make it a vicious act of terrorism
You wanna bring it, so fuck it
Come on and bring the ruckus
And I provoke niggas to kick buckets

No shit, of course Mr. Where the Cash At was going to rap on this
Young Money, Cash Money, Fly Society
Curren$y the hot spitter

Started out on the good side and shook to the hood side
That's where all the crooks reside
And whereever there's crooks, there's crime
Wherever there's crime there's cash
And wherever there's cash, there's I
Anywhere there's I there's my guys of society of people that's all Fly
Both niggas and bitches on the dash for the riches
Any place that I walk in, I make a grand entrance
Classic image, you've got to admit it
It's no wonder that I get all of the attention from all of the women
But these hoes slow though so I make them stay their distance
They try to figure out what keeps my clock ticking
Walk into an office meeting with my watch hidden
Not because I'm scared of getting robbed, but I don't want to be offensive to the executives in here
I got more money than them and they're supposed to be the ones with good jobs
Hot spitter, that nigga, I'm a hood star
'83 Cut, dog, that's my favorite hood car
Corner Pocket, uptown, that was my favorite hood bar
Pass me that chopper, I'll show you what it's good for


Cash rules everything around me
I heard motherfuckers telling niggas that they found me
But how is that possible when you ain't know where Ra be?
Plus y'all niggas hot I tell you stay the fuck around me
I be puffing purple but sometimes I blow that brown weed
Straight from Jamacia, rolled in papers, smuggled in bounty
Getting money, bitch, dollar dollar bill, yeah I got a live crew that's dying to kill you
Niggas feel my New York slang like they feel Ma, you know what I mean?
Fuck outta here, son, I spit 
Pull back a hollow in this point, you gotta chill, god
Enough of that , this week I'll put this burner in your grill, pa
Remy Ma, the queen of NY, she's so nice
AKA, the Bronx savior, Jesus Christ
 so she don't like, whatever they wish on me come back to them thrice
Fuck your dead mother, bitch, and your kid is a bastard
I'm just here for Curren$y, so tell me where the cash at
Money controls all that's in my circumference
Cash rules everything around me, in other words




A rap pro, do a show, good to go, also
Cameo Afro, Virgo, domino
I go Rambo, Gigolo, Romeo
Friday night spend money on a ho
Battle cry Samurai, I'm what they call terror
Erasing all errors, give work to pall bearers
I'm talking caskets, coffins, I'm the bastard swordsman
That cause the loss of massive organs
Fear factor, hereafter, disaster
Climb like the stairmaster, coming through, clear a path of
The raw aggression, that'll take your best on
You start talking Teflon, then you switch to Revlon
Nigga, choose your weapon, hope you got your vest on
Talking Superman shit when you ain't got ya S on?
Get ahead of who? Never you, skills too technical
Leave nothing left for you but residue, the state of vegetable
The mad swag and do flaunt it, my dick and you want it
Only question now, is "nigga, who want it?"
Cause once trouble said (like that) trouble dead
Boy don't make me have to pull out this double edge
A rap pro, do a show, good to go, also
Cameo Afro, Virgo, domino
I go Rambo, Gigolo, Romeo
Friday night spend money on a ho-
Tel, to get a good night's sleep, I'm keeping in step
Do I come off? Yep


My sword crash through your breastplate, splash the blood on your scared face
Drops leave your trail in the snow, showing the clear trace
Behind punctured steel, their bodies rot
Arm and leg missing, head laying near the chopping block
An experience, that shattered your spine, break spirits
Same shit that fucks with your mind, you hate to hear it, nigga
Def man world is silent, he hears nothing
But we punish those who play dumb, years bluffing
Floods and bloodbaths, up on elevator shafts
Many rivers choked with bodies, float it like rafts
Spark wires from auto-fire, verbal and slang with gats
Streets filled with casualties, wherever the tanks was at
Conflict is imminent, preliminary attack
Everyone's a target, so cemeteries are packed
A solid nigga, drink liquids and gas you up
Hit you with a stupefying drug, pass ya cup


Why, you trying to test me swordplay, when I'm sharp in every way
This life I live, I'll do it, all by myself




I must tell you that the Clan is a danger to the public
But still for many men just to hear of the name
Fills them with hate and loathing
But why? They've never harmed anyone
I'm afraid they did
*beat drops*
In the past there's something that they would like to forgive
First, I'll tell you about their style, planned techniques
The main style
"Shaolin Finger Jab!"


Yo..
*sounds of fighting*
(Uh-huh)


We are watchin your whole group
You been busy here
Around the clock, all we need is your orders to move
Met a lot of crosses last night
Young and old!
You been busy here
I respect that!


Yeah, (Eh yo), yeah
Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in (Yo)
Come on! You know what it is
(Thou must bust shots all the time, kid)
(Eh yo, eh yo, eh yo) We're back!


Peep The Jump Off, ain't nothin sweet, get dumped off
Frontin like you won't get deaded and bumped off
Drastic son, master guns that'll run up in plastic ones
And then go, crash in the slums
One tight army, few good men that'll rep
Invade you strongly, Prince of Wales swimmin on feet
Props'll sell, all yellow L's, cops sleepin on nails
Niggas get realer than real, yo
Flash the brown, last time was crowned
All navy Woolridge, Wu kicks, movin them pounds, yo
Last on niggas, great adventures of my niggas
And Castro pictures, sendin a rash out the kitchens
Like the wind, invite the grin, watch niggas rewrite the trend
Wu niggas did it again, yo
Unhighly, octane, die cast metal frame
Lame, let another man with heat handle beef


Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in


Yo, spark the intro, relevant info
Load up the keyboard, 105 tempo
Most heated battles, I've blasted MCs
Some said that the bullets flew by like angry bees
Wu entered on the level where we would wait and listen
While one flashed metal, eight calculate position
The world snapped, once we combined our rap
Drastic measures, priceless treasures on Nap'
Our swords swing, windchill Mount Aerie
Native plant standin' on the tall-grass prairie
Snares and kicks, off the project bricks
It's no act the producer played the role with drumsticks
The warning came unnoticed
It's like the shot on the dock of the bay
That slayed Otis, the Nine-Lotus
Each one adjust to his own environment
Formulate this great LP, a hundred rounds spent
Niggas bent on the fruitless search for nourishment
They long for this proper guidance, encouragement




It be the Lost Tribe, 7 days locked in the dungeon
Foamin at the mouth, mad dog in this production
The uncontrolled substance got me spittin up bars disgustin
The last temptation of the son of David Ruffin
Hold my mic sideways when bustin
On Judgement Day runnin through Hell, yellin and cussin
At MC's in my circumfrance, y'all niggas hand-cuffin
These hoes and ain't read them they rights or nothin
Keep lustin, yeah and I'ma a keep hustlin
With Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in
You know me, everytime you kiss that ho you blow me
You blow trial trin to walk a mile in my Sauconys




We just touched down, Wu shuttle, private jet
Stepped off the plane, the world wept
Roll with the Witty Unpredictable
Talent All Natural, rock with the beatles of hip-hop
Mathematical imperial manifestation of greatness
Make wiz's scream and shout at the top of their breath essence
Captured on tape is precious
Bless mic pure deafness, awaken from you sleep mistake
When the God bring rain, hail, snow to the earthquake




You've been busy
Are you mastered?
{*Repeat 3x*}
You've been busy here..



   Chase your dreams...
 It's the R-O-B
  Rob Report
 with GZA
  and Esera Tualo
 Yeah, yeah, Genius...
   Dreams... chase your dreams
 Diamond Willie, Mega Raw
 Back to reality
Genius, one time, yo


Yo, in these dark streets, life is never complete
Lords escape from those who strictly Play IV Keeps
Neighborhood; poverty stricten
Spin and Tell like Charles Dickens
The witnesses are sickening
I seen some aquitted with the wildest crime commited
While my brother faced life and never did it
Even in High Tide, they throwing brothers off the boat
In the streets, without a vest, it's hard to stay a-float
She wrote a note, before she *sliced her throat*
Couldn't live without her son, who was killed for his coat
I closely examined, physical branden
Witnessed myself standing in a land struck with famine
Multiple homocides from atomic wars
The aftermath, poison in lakes and reseviors
Thoughts spin, I narrowly escaped Hell's Gate
But only in the physical state

Chorus: singer

I knew a girl who wanted to live The Fast Life
(You're living too fast, baby)
Now the pain cuts like a knife
(You're living trife)
Chasing her dreams instead of reality
She lost her way
And nowhere can save her from the danger
Until she finds her way in Heaven


GZA, I got a similar story to tell
'bout the teenage adolescence of this kid named Will
An ex-coroner played the {*censored*}
{*censored*}
Young black and hispanic kids be stressed over
React against the world with rude behavior
In this present year
My search for hunger and ambition is crystal clear
While my young brothers seem to chase dreams
I be gunning down my wildest fantasies


I be escaping fiends, making cream
Ill kids tried to stick me for the green
Seen things that'll make your head spin
Instead *fuckin* stairways to Heaven make my eyes sparkly like a gem
Where your heart has been? Confiscated by the dark
 shorty use a *gun* and spark
Now we's in the street with the heat taking life apart
Seventeen years old, drama unfolds
Missing You like Puffy and Sting, now let them names ring

Chorus {2X}


Chasing dreams for the cash and cream
It seems some of us are fiends
For them luxery things, supreme sting
Losing lives while we out for the green
Stairs to Heaven shine like they diamond rings


Chase your dreams, don't get lost in reality
Cause your dreams will be your savior
And take you all the way to Heaven

Chorus


Nothing can save you baby




There was a clubhouse, owners kept special guests in
Place much darker than the room I rest in
Creepy spot where the dust covers the floor
And some fishing rods is hanging on the door
Painting on the wall of stick figures
That's rumored to walk out the frame and get bigger
Where the imagination runs wild, like who's creeping
Neighbors are acres away and probably sleeping
Wind that's blowing makes the sounds of ghost
Thieves in the room makes you feel really close
Remind me of this late night thriller
I watched the other night, they never caught the killer
Bats that's flying in every direction
Got to stay low and roll with the protection
Visitors that often stay for the summer
They heart beat, like the roll of a drummer


I can feel the presence all around me
The scene isn't funny, I got those chills
I can feel the presence all around me
The scene isn't funny, it's all too real


The moon was full, the sky was black, the bathroom
Hear a crack, wolves roam in packs
In the dining room, a chair rock back and forth
Pulled the table cloth 'til the silverware fell off
Cups and glass plates hit the floor and shattered
Three Blind Mice heard the noise and scattered
Front door was open, welcome mat was soaking
The blood of Christ, plus all four locks were broken
In the backyard, two dogs would growling
They're barking, the eyes and they teeth was sparkling
I started to sweat, they started to get closer
Then I saw a face on a wanted poster
An outlaw who stayed with an empty holster
Used to shoot mugs of beer off the coaster
Make a move to turn the light switch on
Jump up, my jacket was torn
Pages from the photo album begin to turn
Wax dripped from the candle as it slowly burned
Then the lights had started blinking, as if the power was gone
The room become foggy, as if the shower was on
Words was written in the steam on the mirror
In bold print, couldn't have been any clearer
TV was giving out sounds without a picture
And a voice kept saying "I'mma getcha"








Up from the 36 Chambers
Heheh, it's the Ghost *Face Killah*
Heheheh, Wu-Tang!
Wu-Tang Killa Beez, we on a swarm
Wu-Tang Killa Beez, we on a swarm
Wu-Tang Killa Beez, we on a swarm
Wu-Tang Killa Beez, we on a swarm
The RZA, the GZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Inspectah Deck, U-God
Ghostface Killah, the Method Man, Raekwon the Chef, the Masta Killa, Raw Desire, LeVon, Power Cipher
12 O'Clock, 60 Second Assassin
The 4th Disciple, the Brown Hornet
K.D. the Down Low Recka
Shyheim a.k.a. The Rugged Child
Du-Du-Lilz, Mr. Hezekiah
Better known as the Yin and the Yang, the True Master
Isham, DJ Skane, the True Robocop comin' through
Scientific Shabazz, my motherfuckin' man Wise the Civilized
The Shaolin Soldiers, Daddy-O and Popa Ron
Comin' down from the motherfuckin' South end of things
Killa Beez all over your fuckin' planet
Thirty-six chambers of death
Three-hundred and sixty degrees of perfected styles
Choppin' off your motherfuckin' dome
-piece, and every fuckin' borough
Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, Staten Island
The motherfuckin' Bronx, Killa Beez


The sword? C'mon, give him the sword!


Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, rag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, come on in the track to what


The Wu is comin' through, the outcome is critical
Fuckin' with my style is sort of like a miracle
On 34th Street, in the Square of Herald
I gamed Ella, the bitch caught a Fitz like Gerald-
-ine Ferraro, who's full of sorrow
'Cause the ho didn't win, but the sun will still come out tomorrow
And shine shine shine like gold mine
Here comes the drunk monk, with a quart of Ballantine
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone!
Let's get on this mission like Indiana Jones
The GZA, one who just represent the Wu-Tang clique
With the game and soul of an old school flick
Like the Mack and Dolemite, who both did bids
Claudine went to Cooley High and had mad kids
So stop, the life you save may be your motherfuckin' own
I'll hang your ass with this microphone
Make way for the merge of traffic
Wu-Tang's comin' through with full metal jackets
God squad that's mad hard to serve
Come frontin' hard, then Bernhard Goetz what he deserves


Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, rag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, come on in the track to what


No response while I bomb that ass
You ain't shit, your wack-ass town had you gassed
Egos is somethin' the Wu-Tang crush
Souped-up niggas on a stage get rushed
I don't give a goddamn on the shows you did
How many rhymes you got or who knows you, kid
'Cause I don't know you, therefore show me what you know
I come sharp as a blade and I cut you slow
You become so Pat as my style increases
What's that in your pants? Ahh, human feces!
Throw your shitty drawers in the hamper
Next time, come strapped with a fuckin' Pamper
How you sound, B? You're better off a quitter
I'm on the mound, G, and it's a no-hitter
And my DJ, the catcher, he's my man
In a way he's the one who devised the plan
He throws the signs, I hook up the beats with clout
I throw the rhymes to the mic and I strike 'em out
So it really doesn't matter on how you intrigue
You can't fuck with those in the major leagues


Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, rag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, come on in the track to what
Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, rag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, come on in the track to what


Hoods on the right
Punks in the back to what
Niggas on the left
Hoods on the right
Punks in the back, c'mon to what
Let your feet stomp
Rag shit to death
Wild for the night
(Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu)
(Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu)
(Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu)
Niggas on the left, brag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, come on in the track
Clan in da front, let your feet stomp




I had a bad dream
Don't be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams
What a time you chose to be born in


Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world


It was the night before New Year's, and all through the fucking projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a Tec
Outsiders were stuck, by enemies who put fear
And blasted on the spot before the pigs were there
You know hoods, robbers, snipers new in sight, fuck blue and white
They escape before them flash the fucking lights
Gunshots, shatter first-floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether pro-calisthenic, any style you set it
Beat niggas toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides, thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless
Links was snatched off necks, scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made em fold
And squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Construction worker, who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hanging from his farmer's
And it's bugged how some niggas catch slugs
And pockets dug from everything except check stubs
And it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggas laying on roof tops
For his cream he stashed in a shoebox
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers
You don't suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
Those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae, increase the murder rate
Similar to hit men who pull out Tecs and then
Drop those who crack like tacos from Mexican
Rapid, like recipients cashing checks again
Back to the motherfucking spot on Lexington


We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world (x2)


Yo - no time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs
And seize packages and pocket the currency
Cliques control strips full clips are sprayed
Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay
Madness strikes at twelve o'clock midnight
Stick-up kids on the ground broke the staircase light
And I stays harassed, scrambling for petty cash
Jakes on my ass young bucks is learning fast
357's and 44's
Bought inside corner stores, their fire sparks the wars
Hospital floors surrounded by the law
Homicide questioning while the Jakes guard the door
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team
Cause niggas' main concern is CREAM
Some niggas in the jet black Gallant
Shot up the Chinese restaurant, for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead but instead he missed the kid
And hit a twelve-year-old girl in the head, and then fled
Tactical narcotic task force, back off fast
Cause the crime boss is passing off cash
Extortions for portions of streets, causes beef
Having followers of Indians trying to play Chief
You witness the saga, casualties and drama
Life is a script; I'm not an actor but the author
Of a modern-day opera, where the main character
Is presidential papers, the dominant factor






What goes around, comes around
In his own iniquity he dies, through Colombian ties
Faded back to the essence, still forced to learn a lesson
All debts must be settled, no question


The echo from machine gun rounds simmers
A fallen soldier, his gun hangs on his shoulders, lights get dimmer
Key swinging back and forth on the ignition
The stench is only part of the horrible condition
As he waits for the smoke to clear, all he heard was the blast
From the bomb, that kept ringing in his ear
Along with gun bearing troops, fatigues and wearing boots
From far away, whether night or day, you hear 'em shoot
It's a very unforgiven and hostile environment
Where military hardware is the only requirement
A world where the deceased is just a thing of the past
And each and every advance is more costly than the last
A President's madness, responsible for losses
Political forces, land litter with corpses
Like the youth in the street, who gamble and gets scarred
Even the troops in the field, bet it all on one card
Some question they reason for being here
Facing incredible odds and a recession that's so severe
Raised in the shadow of a terrible loss
And the atmosphere, even breathing air can cost
A place where the majority is going for self
With the agenda not far beyond, personal wealth
It's like, either you eat, or you die from hunger
Starving to death, until the coroner calls your number
With no bread to bite or break from off the table
The caskets had exceeded the number of cradles
When it's dark, danger falls across the plateau
Unmasking your deceit, in the streets then sat low
These stomping grounds are known to bring misfortune
Fueled by his obsessions, he murder for portions
And died from of a misreable death, his final undoing
His biggest downfall was from the people he left

Here I am loungin' at a hype party
Then I see this lady with a hellafied body
With a pair of bedroom eyes that were clocking The Genius
Well, you see what I mean is
She had the look as if she was attracted
To me so what I did, I reacted
In a manner to show that I was feeling the same
Now check out the game
I said lovely, I be The Genius and how ya doing?
I'm on a chase and you're the one that I'm pursuing
She said it's the pleasure Genius, I'm doing kinda fine
But what's on your mind?
I said


Girl
Come Do Me


I said sexy, where you live over yonder?
What's your name?
She said it's Yolanda
She said she knew me from back in the days
And that I had her running on a wild sex craze
I said now you're kinda big and well-developed
And parts of your body just made my head swell up
She said her feelings were so deep for me
To the point where she wanted to sleep with me
I said c'mon babe, I know you're jokin'
She said if I'm jokin' you must be smokin'
I said the only think I wanna be smokin' is your boots
And she said "I hear ya troop"
And just from that little bit of conversation
It put my hormones into activation
The whole thing just went to my head
As I held her hands and said
Baby, come do me




Hey good looking how many times may I say
That your gorgeous smile takes my breath away
Your soft warm little voice is very pleasing
And your tight mini-skirt is kind teasing
Me, it makes me wanna do the nasty
And you got the look of being very classy
So go ahead and whip it on me
As Latifah said,"gimme that body"
So you see right there I desire you
I'm not a pimp and I don't want to hire you
Cause that's not what The Genius is about
Let my love slide in and never slip out



 Yo butter butter
 Protect Ya Neck baby
 Respect due pa
 Peace
 Peace
 Word up Wu-Tang in the house though


I guess alot of people in ya

You know what I'm sayin'
And I think that comes across well in the video
I haven't seen you live yet, I'm waitin for the chance

You know you probaly really get into it

Old Dirty corporata, splash, I'm up on the punanny flash
Bad gas, Macintosh, the light is red

All you niggas I'm puttin you in your place

HOOK 


Mr. No-Meaner, pussy ho-beater

Yeah, pump that shit, testin

To my click y'all, you can't quit y'all
Wu-Tang bangin' that dope shit y'all
That make you wanna roll up and smoke shit y'all
To the beat y'all, you can't sleep y'all
On my flow y'all niggas don't know y'all
You see my style calm but wild
You witness the rhyme, nothin but dimes
The eightball murder verse, freestyle or rehearsed
I wreck emcees whether I'm last or first
What, what, what, what, hazardous dart
Visual long forgotten art
That fell apart, til the blood ran from the heart
Pump through the street, Rza make re-break beats
Packed seats, rapid fire raps at off track meets
And an arm tank, high rank, heavy metal shank
Blow 'em off the plank when they ships approach the bank
Wu niggas rollin, throwin the first rap slogan
Heroes of Hogan, shot up the military clothin'
Quickly blow up, rolled up in rappers like pennies
My brother stack tracks on the behalf of many
With the wisdom, power of, science from experts
Self applyin, that put giants in the network
Through compact discs and televised live quotes
We multiply our strength, on a worldwide note
Yes, what, what


Yes, yes y'all, you don't stop
You keep on, til the break o dawn
Ah yes, yes y'all, you don't stop
Ah Wu-Tang known to make your body rock





Let's drink wine from the purest grapevine and rhyme
Out my motherfucking mind
Metal shine, light blind, cut the mic line
Catch juice from the lamp pole
Fifteen twenty-inch woofers blow the manhole
Made the street crack, massive feedback
Allah Math spin the beat back
The crowd look while the stage shook
Carpenters made errors
Craftsmen had his head severed
Pyroclastic flow, heavy like tons of snow
Wrote this rhyme in video, verbal assassin
Blastin, exploit your break through explosively
Echo chamber ate that rap up ferociously
Gain control, optimize the input channel
I set it relatively high for those on a panel
CD with the durable long-life cover
Very similar to no other
I seen a million try to set afloat, thousands that show
Observe with the patience of watching a flower grow
But one individual they forgot to frisk so
Now his pursuit is not without risk
A special no thanks for being flank
While journalists stay runnin in front of tanks
Flew out first class, came back, closed task
Rough path surfaces, no math
Military campaign, bust shots, cause inflammation of the brain
Beat Crazy Eddie insane
Feel the pain, niggas reign


I'm gonna crash your crew




Hey yo
Turn my shit up son too
No doubt (know exactly what you talkin about)
Do-do yo (You know?)


I'm gonna crash ya crew, I'm gonna crash you too


Let's drink wine from the purest grapevine in Rhine
Out my motherfuckin mind, metal shine
Light blind, cut the mic line
Catch juice from the lamp pole
15 20-inch woofers blow the manhole
Made the street crack, massive feedback
Allah Math', spin the beat back
The crowd look, while the stage shook
Carpenters made errors, craftsman, had his head severed
Pyroclastic flow, heavy like tons of snow
Wrote this ryme in video, verbal assassin, blastin
Exploit ya breakthrough explosively
Echo chamber ate that rap up ferociously
Gained control, optimized the input channel
I said it relatively high for those on the panel
CD with the durable, long-life cover
Very similar to no other
I've seen a million try to set a flow, thousands that show
I observe with the patience of watchin a flower grow
But, when individuals they forgot the frisk
So, now his pursuit, is not without risk
A special no thanks for being flanked
My journalists that stay runnin in front a tanks
Flew out first class, came back close cash
Rough task, services, no math
Military campaign, bust shots, cause inflamation of the brain
Beat Crazy Eddie insane
Feel the pain, niggas reign




Make sure you got your helmet on and strap it on tight
Via satellite, I crash like Roswell, landed in a poverty hell
El Isreal, sippin cocktails, then we build like hammers and nails
Verbal carpentry, rap gettin rocked in road cells
Economically, I give labotomies, stay high off the finest weed
Form a colony off the words I prophecy
Brain damage you, crash your crew like Norfolk lawsuits
Mayday, pull out your parachute, check the parables
Drunk off the Absolut, get off my avenue
Drove you over like the bulldozer
Tell your cap'(tain) to train war soldiers
Your whole camp get the cold shoulder






It was so beautiful. It was almost unfair
It's cold but it's true. It was so cold it got warm
Kids out in the schoolyard and playing
It was nice and calm. It was dangerous


When the MC's came, live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete Rocked it on
Now on to the mental plane, spark the brains with the building to be born
Crazy is on the track
Check em check chicka icka etta UHH


Strange Times
Everybody got their get high (Oh my)
Their get right, their get nice, they get by (Oh my)
They get open, get ready, get primed
The national pastime is victimless crime
You want your thrill and I want mine
As long we can get it we ain't got to say why
I don't mean to pry, you ain't got to lie
We ain't got to speak when it's written in the eyes
Whenever she was high off the sparkle in her palm
She had a young girl's smile and a hustler's charm
Dying from the city where the hustler's are born
Made, traced, murdered, replaced
Life-long residents barely feel safe
And the street's offer plenty taste and little faith (Break it down)
Little face, soft lips, little waist (Break it more)
Tiny hands (Oh god) fat ass (Oh more)
Big eyes like birthday surprise
Super dupa fly, born in 85
Repeat it to yourself: This is a victimless crime
Psyche your mind there's a victim every time
Your tasty little pill, your freaky little thrill
Pray won't leave you still, you wonder how it feel
It's real, pussy like some money that you steal
Eww




Crime and medicine
Dead wrong and live in America
Off the block and right in your area
Fresh apples and peaches for the president
HA HA
Crime and medicine
Dead wrong and live in your area
From the street corner, right in your residence
Fresh apples and peaches for the president
Crime
Fresh peaches and apples for the president
Crime
Fresh chocolates and apples for the president
Crime
Fresh linens and apples to the president
Crime
Fresh




(One two, one two)
No doubt
(The microphone's on)
Cross my heart, hope to die, word is bond
(I've been waiting along time for this)
Here we go, Killah Priest, '97, '98


It's the Byzantine king, supreme
All kneel kiss the ring into a Elohim
I blow steam from the families of the Maccabees
Smack emcees, watch 'em scream, "Your Majesty!"
Make them suffer the capacity of tragedy
Hold the crowd down like gravity
Back the fuck off, stop grabbing me, hands off me
Niggas start to bore me, I'm getting sleepy, I need some coffee
Me and my Wu-bandits
We bury niggas deep in the canvas, body bandage
Like some mummies, you fucking dummies
You can't take nothing from me
It's the longest waited
The most anticipated, the album hesitated
Scream the name out, "Killah Priest!"
I leave the blood spilling in the streets
I'm from the dark hills of Brownsville
The seven shields on windmills across the killing fields
Never forget it, tell them rap critics
I speak in arithmetics
So they can never get it, I'm too scientific
Lyrics explicit, I roll with thirsty niggas, thieves and killers tigers, gorillas, faces like Godzilla
We stomp rappers and smile like a card dealer
We got iller, cross my heart and hope to die
We multiply, by the hundreds
Drunken by the thousand, see me outside your show browsing
Beating up your soundmen
Player haters and players, we give 'em cold stares
Any last prayers?


Concrete techniques, bomb beats that cause casualties
My faculty, hold it down like gravity
Rapidly threaten like weapons to adolescents
Ghetto residents quick to past tense your present
State of the slums, kill for a plate of crumbs
Fake ones, they're coarse with smiles with snake tongues
I'm deep into this,I sometimes gasp for air
Deadly warfare, hot blocks, cops, and cold stares
Shots blare like fireworks on July the 4th
Weapons get tossed, fugitive sliding off
My forces combine, new world, 2009
Digital criminals, we make mills in cybercrime
It's all planned ahead 2 times, I see the signs through a great mind
The heaviest chains could not bind


We stare you eye to eye
We tell the truth no lie
We cross our heart and hope to die.. hope to die..


High ranked officials in armed tanks with missiles
Blood drizzle, simple fact, you slept on the issue
That before you started jerkin off Joysticks and Sega
I was rocking off 100 watt amps in Cerwin-Vega
True fine tune it, ship enough units
MCs ask, "Who be those rhyme killers in masks?"
No doubt, difficult task to last in the square
Beware, infinite amount of darts is in the air
I'm victorious with no opponents and blast through components
With microphonics, watch the whole world live the moment
Anything anti became approaching this
Our incapable love speech remains motionless



Hope to die..




You've practiced 20 years? You must be extremely good then
Perhaps, you'll try with me


Come and taste my seasonin', Chef, the cooking that is marvelous
Back over a stove, makin' your mouth water, you starve for this
Exclusive sneakers with hard denim, heavyweight
A neighbor illustrated Alex Haley with paper (paper)
Waves spinnin' like the Titanic, come take a float on
Silky like King Henry VIIIs robe in late spring
Restaurants with skeleton keys, it's big business
Well groomed and elegant posture is real dapper
Status is gigantic, culture's alpaca
Meetings in the Vatican, drinkin' scotch with the Muscle Milk
Praises go to Ason, the dynasty Mr. Russell built
Feed me royal shottas with Glocks, clean 'em with GT Oil
China dolls from Bangkok, we bang 'em, train 'em and make 'em loyal
Trees stank, she come kiss the top of my Yves Saint
Wise-Universal Tang when I bang
Grizzly with the big bank, it's 5 stars, y'all, when I call rank


Egos are somethin' that the Wu-Tang crush
These stupid jealous niggas, y'all 'bout to get rust
This ashes to ashes to dust to dust
These derelict MC's cannot fuck with us, Lord
Egos are somethin' that the Wu-Tang crush
These stupid jealous niggas, y'all 'bout to get rust
This ashes to ashes to dust to dust
These derelict MC's cannot fuck with us, Lord


Rifles out, bear like the Russian
Octagon tuggin' silk drawers frontin', while her head stuntin'
Mulsannes flood the garage
Man the goats launchin' charge cards from Africa
Catch me in the hookah lodge
Brains linked, twisted Cohibas, say the seeds bang
Coffee pots with graveyard rings, flippin' Gs
Yankee hoodlum on the top of the charts
Dart throwers, they're sharks
Everybody run
When my gun barks


Non-athletic anti-semetic synthetic rappers get no credit
Pathetic septic lines, incompetent styles not embedded
Wu-Tang slang bangs in your brain, this is not genetic, prophetic
Unadulterated talent while y'all talk that bullshit rhetoric


Egos are somethin' that the Wu-Tang crush
These stupid jealous niggas, y'all 'bout to get rust
This ashes to ashes to dust to dust
These derelict MC's cannot fuck with us, Lord

Where is the money? Ha ha...




Peace 
  Say it again

The Genius 

Verse One: Ol Dirty Bastard 
I'll grab and the mic and I'll damage ya
Cut your whole stamina
Here comes the medical examiner
One verse then you're out for the count
 make sure he sniffs the right amount
Wake him up and then ask him
Why did he attend this --
Competition to get an ass kickin so tremendous
Boy you know you shouldn't bother this
Leave me alone like the 
I got the asiatic flow mixed with disco
Roll up on the scene like the Count of Monte Crisco
And MC's start to vanish
[I stepped up to a jet black kid, started speakin spanish!
Yo he wasn't from Panama
I asked him how he get so dark, the nigga said suntanama!
He responded so fast, you made me laugh]
Ha-ha-ha, HARARRRH 
[Kick the hundred strongest rhymes
I brought out the punk in him
Caught him with a strong five deadly venom
Told him enter the Wu-Tang
Witness the Shaolin slang, that'll crush the shit you bring]
I watch your ass take a big fall, why?!
My Main Source, is like a friendly game of stickball
And as you step up to bat man 
You try to Jew me for a rhyme 
Go out like Nazi; you'll be wishin your fuckin ass stayed
Home and played 
Or watchin Happy Days sweatin 
With Ralphie and Richie Cunningham, Joni and 
Wu, who? Me gettin wreck so I'm through
Like a ten and a half foot, gettin in a seven 

Have your ass doin some Night Fever shit like John Travolta
I come strong I make knowledge born, I flip the script
And rock on from P.M. 
Pass the Hammer you're broke down, English grammar what what
Can't understand it here's the panaroma

Should of stepped to those fuckin kids who tried to 
Yeah I bust that ass before

And want to perform a massacre
Better be coming with some motherfucking shit that's spectacular
Crush the personal vendetta, well you just better
Start stepping to your 
Put the pedal to the metal
You and your DJ change your name to Ma and Pa Kettle
As I 
It's not a Newport but it's still live with pleasure
[C'mon don't be silly, just a bag of sensamilli
Rolled up in a] Motown Philly
[I used to write all the time when I smoked
Grab the mic, then I kinda like went for broke
With visually concepts strongest rhymes and biceps
Lyrically speakin, three to four rhymes a choke
Some think they be harmin this, claimin they be bombin this]
But they still remains anonymous
I pull strings like Jimi Hendrix
Ride more beats that go backs to the days of Eddie Kendricks
I teach the truth to the youth, I say 
Here's the truth, better start wearing 
Arm yourself with a shield
 just like the Children in the Cornfield




The nigga had a pair of Air Olden Polynice's on
Oh shit, the nigga had a pair of Air Christian Slaters
Rebel I, slay the max, it's really Digital
Rockin' the latest in, every day comin' at niggas
Rockin' the latest in Ben Stillaways
Fuck that, the next big thing, lay this as Hollywood niggas
Now that's a money thing
Yo yo


I was +Dashing+ through the hood
Eighteens with the whip, smoke gray
Leavin' skid marks on five-oh
Smokin' all the way, hahaha!
With my all-star team, bitches see our shine
Yo son we gotta make that +CREAM+ whether raps or nicks and dimes


They call me Rollie, watch me poly with the wide body Dinali
Packed the bad hottie, rocked enough ice to play hockey
I swarm like paparazzi, she popped a wheelie on the candy apple Kawasaki
Everything is sloppy, philosophical for those who copy
I'll probably splash her tonight, don't block me
Sippin' on Lime Bacardi got me toxy
Plus the Cali 'dro holdin' me, I'm 'bout to 'scape like the Roxy
Ever property, Monopoly, big shotti
Snatch the +CREAM+, whether in the concert hall or in the lobby
Used to be a hobby, got me duckin' Rudy Giulianni
Like I'm still coppin' big eights from papi
Follow me, whether Mardi Gras' or house party
It's wild like safari, ain't mean to catch the body
But had 'em wobbly off the first blow, tryin' to knock me
I'm known to pump ya blood like the theme song to Rocky
Kamikaze, might karate chop ya head like a natty dread
Then call myself Collar Ratsi
Professionally trained, I aim for your artery
I give the autographs but charge for photography
Not hardly kid, you awkward Godbody
You'se a carbon copy, just started to rock Wallys
Spark the broccoli, spaz off this ghetto opery
Or catch the hot seat, you're batty bwoy without ya posse
Seen..


Come, come, come
One for the dough, son
Give me the reasons


They couldn't get me, watch me move swiftly
Broke the unmarked fifty with this cabby who was a gypsy
He stayed tipsy, said he loved his bills crispy
Drivin' the streets he kept heat on the night, shifty
Quickly, who ring bells like it's twelve on Sunday?
While the stage catch shells from forceful gunplay
Mere fact that the track was a fierce counterattack
All those who couldn't multiply were sent back
No tanks, low rank, soldiers hittin' the heart
Tainted the heart of an empire, was torn apart
Brought to a halt from a front full assault
The chemist left the lab with undetermined results
They saw the swordsman sift electrical volts
The audience threw nuts with loose screws and bolts
The archives automatically changed ya stiff vibes
It was layin' in the zip drive from chest five




Your faith in Shaolin is courageous
You blind fool we have our teachings to share
Our joy with the people
And there too suffer for them as well
You have learned your style well
Wu-Tang Style




That summer... the summer '88 is the best...
But that's your nostalgia though
"Just for the nostalgia," you gotta say
That's my most nostalgic moment of hip-hop music ever
Right


I'll just sit right here and sing that good, old-school shit to you
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own
Oh baby you know
All that lovemaking we did
Boy, it was so real, I wanna feel that again
Long lost friend from way back when
Eric B was president
Tell me where the melody went
And if you still care, say ''yeah, yeah, yeah''
Sing it like I used to do
This one is for me and you, oh


La-di-da-di-da-di-da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
And oh baby, you know
Make love
Thats how you do it
Just like you did it back then
This is dedicated to you


I'll just sit right here and sing that good old school shit to you
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own
Oh baby you know, that love making we did
Boy, It was so real, I wanna feel that again
Loyal friends from way back then
Tell me can you vision us
36 Chambers high
Feels like were there, yeah yeah yeah
Remix of a fantasy, I hear em singing back to me like...


La-di-da-di-da-di-da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
And oh baby you know. make love
Thats how you do it
Just like you did it back then
This is dedicated to you


Nah, we dont wish todays game was old again
We just wish it wasnt full of Draconian, Babylonian, phony men
FOH my summation fascinates, we have debates
Whos the greatest living or passed away
I ask MC, see what she has to say
Eric B or Master P, some see it differently
87 meant to me? I try to describe it, you try to relive it
I try to revive it hoping that you get it, yeah
Something about La Di Da Di got inside our bodies
Something about My Adidas coming out the speakers
Used to do the Wop or the Pee-Wee Herman
Rest in peace Heavy D, Moneyearnin Mount Vernon
Lets go


La-di-da-di-da-di-da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
And oh baby you know
Make love
Thats how you do it
Just like you did it back then
This is dedicated to you


Oh baby you know
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you




At the holy city of Mecca, Grey Flannel cologne
Crazy ammo get blown, wherever I sit, son
That is my throne (Raekwon: you know how we do it)


Aiyo, POP POP POP went the shots, who's to blame?
Three get dropped and removed from the game
One get knocked, now his whole life is changed
Cuz he's so far from free in a world that seem strange


I come from a place where they say, death comes too soon
Where the hoods on the block, dance to a different tune
Every night and every day, hotels of foul play
Turns fatal, when this hostile land of AK's
On any date, not wait to pump them rounds
The reminder; it's a murderer stomping ground
With one less witness, gunned down in the staircase
Who had led his crew, but he was moving at a snail's pace
Many suspects, many possible motives
Just kept coming with unstoppable explosives
The weak fold in these most extreme conditions
While the rivals quickly strengthen their position
The mission was to move in, with sheer brute force
And lives, they get lost, on a collision course
The streets are fascinating, so they gotta explore it more
But not without walking through some hurricane corridors
Become the most wanted, life can seem haunted
Thugs and agents who work closely up on it
Patriotic hustlers that kill for presidents
Conceal the truth, but can't hide the evidence
A man died holding some dice that he was shaking
Like a bank stop, but no valuables was taken
Shot at 8:45, but he died at 9
A video was the most precise witness to the crime




The story had a familiar ring of truth
But it needed, a little more tangible proof
He was blown off the map, behind the aggravated kidnaps
Shrap' metal everywhere, the bomb was gift wrapped
The problem had became increasingly urgent
Since the product was nothing but bags of detergent
In all the years of war, this was the most
Vicious battle and mainly fought from up close
A bundle burglary, with no surprise
Just another sloppy murder that was in disguise
Now they can do nothing but hope and pray
That the boys don't come through with the scope and spray
Valuable time comes with a price to pay
Smoke on a deserted street, just a mile away
Tusslin' with those cannibals, right from the start
That'll rip out your heart, and consume the fattest part
Better watch from the eye of federal agents
Selecting cams, while they was disguised as vagrants
Not knowing that a prisoner had held the key
Of a co-defendant, he was so far from free
Detectives search into a distant past
Of a young gun who made the block grow fast
Narrow ducks who were cooked and came home to roast
The suspects would seek refuge off the coast




Word up, holding it down
Holding the fort, nigga, youknowhatisayin?
All we need is a bunch of red coats coming through
Stayin' official on some gangster shit
Bloodhounds, thirsty, lurking in the bushes
Yeah... (1. b4 Nf6 2. c4)




POP POP POP, when it shots, whose to blame?
Three get dropped and removed from the game
One get knocked, now his whole life is changed
Cuz he's so far from freeing the world, that seem strange


I come from a place where they say, death comes too soon
Where the hoods on the block, dance to a different tune
Every night and every day, hotels of foul play
Turns fatal, when this hostile land of AK's
On any date, not wait to pump them rounds
The reminder; it's a murderer stomping ground
With one less witness, gunned down in the staircase
Who had led his crew, but he was moving at a snail's pace
Many suspects, many possible motives
Just kept coming with unstoppable explosives
The weak fold in these most extreme conditions
While the rivals quickly strengthen their position
The mission was to move in, with sheer brute force
And lives, they get lost, on a collision course
The streets are fascinating, so they gotta explore it more
But not without walking through some hurricane corridors
Become the most wanted, life can seem haunted
Thugs and agents who work closely up on it
Patriotic hustlers that kill for presidents
Conceal the truth, but can't hide the evidence
A man died holding some dice that he was shaking
Like a bank stop, but no valuables was taken
Shot at 8:45, but he died at 9
A video was the most precise witness to the crime, it's on




Uh, crips and bloods, bricks and thugs
Clips and thugs, that's gangsta
Lifes, more disciples, send me assault riffles
Bust if he don't like you, that's gangsta
O-3-1's, and, Latin Kings with
Dirty guns, that's gangsta
Shot dozen coppers, Mexican mafias
Killing innocent, and son they dons


Yo, a view to a killing, aim two to the ceiling
When niggas started illin', random chick catch a stray
Now her whole nose is peeling, and some girls is squeeling
So the po-po's concealing the exits
The four-four's grilling at the next shit
Homey's wetless, when they tech spit
Death is something, that's the best shit
Niggas play XBox 360, wet shit
Halo 2 and SoCom, fresh paws hit the block
There go Saddam, muthafuckas know your moms
But get frustrated and blow your bombs
Little niggas is too small to hold they arms
Drex' should of thought about that, before get gone
Sixteen years old getting charged as adult
Conservatives, want harsher sentences but get no result
And I still can't read a burner, maybe I'm part of the problem
But when the war's going on outside, you know the outcome






The way that momma raised us was pure faith
So diablo wouldn't faze us or daze us
Or lay us down to sleep
Know the wolf from the sheep
Or the sheep who cried wolf
And threw the deadly hoof
While the wolf was asleep
I keep my mind a ghost
Follow my heart the most
Don't play fools too close
Sleep with my eyes at post
So Diablo won't be hostin the game of life
The knife sits by throats of the young
And blows death straight through the lungs
As the mind gets washed by visions of sugar plums
But we shall overcome cause we ain't dumb
But we ain't smart, they got the girls by the hearts
And the niggas by the nuts
Ear, tongue and butts
Yeah, they're trying to fuck us up
But, shit, you know what's up
We gotta get with the movement
And move men soon
They consume every womb who bares
Beneath the stairs of their doom
Best believe they're gonna shove em in a tomb

Chorus: repeat 4X

Cause everytime I step to the microphone
I put my soul on 2 inch reels
That I don't even own


Early Saturday mornin I was cartoon gazin
Slowly broke into the kitchen
To fill a bowl with some Raisin Bran
As I ran up and down the TV stations
I witnessed Indian Joe
Getting tricked out of this nation
By a silly hillbilly
Who laughed as the shit happened
Everything's the same
The game continued into rappin
Deception is at an all-time high
You give a piece of your soul
To receive some crumbs from the pie
But you know I keep on rappin til the break of dawn
Even though it is my soul that I do not even own

Chorus: repeat 4X


I was po', black and broke
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
Ass-out, wide open waitin for my shit to come on out
Speakin about the time before I got signed
I was coolin behind Coolio in the County Line
My big brother used to say I was an asshole
Didn't graduate, couldn't handle the hassle
Of high school, why fool
Wit' foolish rules and guidelines
Fuck the cap and tassels
Said forget the trade and tried rhymes
Hooked up with J-Swift, got with 2-4-2
Me and my nigga L.A. Jay back at S.C.U
I grab the MIC one-time
Check it, 1-2, we in
Freakin' major flavors with my fellow Nubians
Takin shit to the next level
Too bad I sold my soul to the fuckin devil




I keep your heart is PZA-pumping, the beat is just the jump in
The crowd get wild off my style, they want something
The herds start stomping the promoters that be fronting
They sue for Cash Rule but the courts they give 'em nothing
Your soundman came with the feedback like we need that
Security's shining flashlights like "where the weed at?"
Stay in your place, see you guys smoke blowing in your face
And it's hard to stop it once we came to drop it
Who bold enough to challenge this deadly reportation
Of keeping MC's in a hopeless situation
No comparison, if you put the darts side by side
One will weigh out the other
Like friend next to brother
Try to take cover as the battle comes to a closion
That structure that supported your rap started implosion
Your whole chest and your world caved in
They completely gave in, they was far from brave men


Did ya say that?
Record execs wanna push the album way back?
And hold out on my advance?
They didn't pay that
Producers want seven points?
He didn't play that

Raindrops keep falling on your head
So heavy that it's tearing what you're wearing
Ain't caring, so you're hearing what I said
I'm making sure it stick
Like a stamp you don't lick
Or a snare with no kick
So you know it be authentic like the hand-made works of a carpenter
The 64 squares make 'em use a sharpener
Kept a fine point with the lead, then it's thread
On the paper then like cancer it would rapidly spread
This music is addictive but can't live without it
At times you shout it The Wu, they be about it
A strong following with the die-hard supportedly
The loyalty came from the songs that went accordingly
I couldn't be more wrong if I changed the format
Did something different from the most explored rap


Did ya say that?

Positive Elevation Always Correct Errors
That's the fire till my Clansmen starts to spread terror
Spin your wig back like we DJ'ing, he ain't playing
My songs set a trap, catch 'em laying
Now we stuck but he's overwhelmed by what he came across
Not to play it is a terrible loss at whose cost?
People wait like never before for the ball to drop
At the gate lined up for a tape to cop
I still run into students banging my first joint
Wrote a essay off the second LP to prove a point
That a rhyme is a terrible thing to waste
Gimmicks and radio the God don't chase
But I replace your wackness, it shows in your flows
Immaturenesses, all of your hoes, case closed
Most of your strength is in the pocket of you clothes
That you endorse in every rhyme like it's garments and robes (echo)

What can I say, we wouldnt be here today, if the old school didnt pave the way

You cant hang....
We the new wu-tang
Check out our lyrical slang as we begin

Todays Topic.... DNA
Genetic makeup of every living thing

Its a code .... broken up in sections
Plus carrying ..... all lifes instructions
Implicit construction..... the master key
The thing that makes me a dope MC

DNA ---
The physical
The mental
Other traits
Eventually mutate
To create to create to createeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

Were Changing through time
Life track Remix
Wind and unwind
DNA double helix

Remix these strands
To rebuild our hands
Each time a new brand
Earthll never get bland

My rhymes make or break you.. hope you feel this
Competition was all dudes so we came to steal this

Abnormal Cell division is what causes cancer
Burning up the competition Im not even a Cancer
Cells dividing
Like dreams divided
Tryna reach our goals
So we keep on striving

Adenine
Thymine
Cytosine
Guanine
Base pairs
They pair
Like we are
Rhymin

Like beats come together to create a rhythm
Parts of DNA form a living organism

We used deoxyribonucleic acid
As we mastered the ways to create this classic
Your losing to 3 girls i guess its kinda tragic

Im different like 2 chainz
Because i mutated
DNA has 2 chains
You see how thats related

If you didnt get it
You may be dumb
Don't mess with me
I'm not the one
Once i start
No one can stop me
Like DNA unwinds so it can be copied

During DNA replication
DNA unwinds so it can be replicated
Changing rearranging , cell mutation
They also unwind
To instruct the making
Of essential components
Of a cell
This crew is gonna win
Can't you tell

Hold Up Dj Kill That Beat

I got something I wanna spit accepella
Im raps cinderella
Im raps recreation
Told my team put that beat on probation
I must be some type of mutation
Because I developed a trait that made me the best in the nation
These fake rappers claiming they gon kill but I'm immune by adaptation
Natural selection survival of the fittest
Just remember mother nature screaming anybody can get it
Im the reproduction of a trait chosen to persist
You can't resist
A flow that you craving like this
I'm not even a rapper but im killing these un-camo-flauged writers
I'm the greatest
That's a topic that been debated and contemplated
If you ain't got a trait we need you're joining the extincted
Only the best of the best are the ones who stay alive
You ain't meant to survive
If you can't "set fire to the rain"
You won't see another day
If you got short legs how you gonna run when you the prey (talking)
I'mma beast emerging from her cage
Stepping outta her shell
Shyness ain't a trait that mutates in this world
Absorb the flow
Change it up
Martin Tommy Gina y'all know wassup
Mutation the act of being altered or rearranged
Nature's a fighter standing up for some change
Only the strong survive
Only God knows why
A sudden change in inheritable characteristics
I'm the purple apple who decided to be different
Darwin came to the realization
Each beak had its own modification
He called this evaluation
Something every generation is doing
It's amusing like the dream that I'm persuing
Combining science with music
It's my passion with my have to
Science rap battles
With my knowledge I'm building castles
Like I was meant to

Hold Up wait a minute, Ya thought we was finished?

A mistake in Dna causes things to transfigure
Your team will do it big
But i grantee will do it bigger
That something to consider
Maybe the damages from environmental assets
Gave me the power to mutate this classic
It something tragic
Ultraviolet Light
Nuclear Radiation
Cause change in DNA bases
Call this a mutation
Somethings always changing
Mutates my vocal cords
Now im spiting bars
I know we not talking extraterrestrial
But im a shooting star
When a base pairs with the wrong base
It cause things to mutate
And allows the difference we hide with in
To escape
Even though society don't want us to be different
Nature had a different vision

Mutation, celebration
Changing our relations
Genes are inherited
Momma can tell that we related

These children act like age is anything but just a number
They looking like a camry and Im rollin in a hummer




Come on my niggas, yo..
Put your guns in your right hand and hold it down towards the floor
Point all your guns down towards the floor for a minute
Yeah, you could hold 'em, just point 'em down towards the floor
For a sec, aight? (Yo y'all ain't fuckin' wit the Wu)
We gon' splash like this, all my wild Digi heads
(Y'all niggas is crook) Y'all niggas move a little up to the front
Y'all niggas know what I'm talkin' about
Word up, my weedheads, y'all play the right for a second
Nahmean? Check it out
All y'all niggas on X, y'all keep y'all asses in the back
Aight? Straight up, in fact, matter of fact
We gon' mingle this shit like mothafuckin' peas in the mothafuckin' pot
Straight up Digi Digi style, word up, as we splash you right
(Yeah, yeah, my niggas is crew, now y'all ain't
Fuckin' wit the Wu
Oh now y'all.. come on!)


Walk wit a diddy bop ock, you silly pop, Jiffy Pop
Fuck around, son, I'll blow ya face up with fifty shots
Sharp darts, and it pop pop like tarts
Extreme speed like Anakin inside the Pod
Headed for the finish line, BOODOO, watch Bobby cross it
Hoes with the diamonds on your toes, come on and floss it
I be one of those tall skinny cats with the four-nine
Three-eleven that rips through Power-U's and breaks spines
I culture power-tuggin' boys who be drunk, buggin'
Lovin' loud noise from toys, club thuggin'
Sweet chocolate deluxe, rugged, sexy buttercup
That don't give a fuck about the cop in the club
Or the bouncer with the flashlight, one walked passed, right?
Some pulled the razor and chopped his ear like he was Mad Mike
I played the cipher in the corner, teachin' math
One for one thoughts, a hundred brothers won't last
"Do U"
Because you can't do me
"Do U"
Because you can't do me
Come on!


Yo, son, Wake Up!
Yo, I gotta do this, man
I gotta get this money, son

Features in the crowd, appearance like, "Black I'm proud"
In the background, no sounds, four pound, we hold ground!
Brooklyn bound, seven initials up in the crown
One man's ramblin', officials they shot him down
Supreme, extreme, lean, killin' machines
All I wanna do is feed my seed, plus my team
Keep it logical, no games, straight up about Prodigal
Diabolic drums and I run from none
Testimony one, give my life before my only son
Thelonious crumbs, why they wanna press me for guns?
Now I'm in the face of the judge, court case thug
From a race, laced, based on drugs, some made slugs
As it was written, stroll through any block forbidden
Glock hidden, why they wanna stop precision?
Eighty-five percent of my brothers locked in prison
And we just keep dyin' for the love of good livin'
But Do U! Do U! Do U!




You know those jams in the park, produced the spark
Made me feel words how I read books in the dark
I always took it to heart, loved the art
A lifetime of darts, ripped crews apart
Made their stay real short, I stamped the passport
Couldn't bring through no wack shit of no sort
I walked the borough challengin' the best that stood
Torch metal mics, they conduct better than wood
Once I electrify and only expect to die
Rounded Bed-Stuy, ZZZZ, nigga fry
My opponent block, the beat comin' from his box
Investment ranker who's a joke in the stocks
Keep a rhythmic pace, maintainin' great balance
Movin' in steps of unheard of silence
Normally progressioners, they're slow steepin'
Niggas wanna light up when there's gas leakin'


"Do U feel?"



Talkin bout drama

I met a young brother, how young about eight
He seemed intelligent and rather quite straight
I greeted him, and struck a conversation
To see if the youngster had some self-motivation
Peace brother, what's your name, and how ya be
He said I be soon coming off the currency
I said gettin paid, he said yeah like my man's brother
Who has a condo he shares with his baby's mother
He said a condo beats my apartment
With no lights and no gas and much backed up rent
No hot water or heat, and invaded by plenty rats
That'll eat up the average alleycat
He said yeeahhhh boyyyeee, that's poverty
I said word, I know and it bothers me
Cuz we are the victims, of a situation
How wicked man, seperated
A nation and got us cold-killin off one another
(Word-word, to the mother)
It's getting hot, how hot, hotter than July
Cuz the murder and crime rate is rising very high
For example, in my neighborhood, it's so hot
I'm often woke up, from the alarming sound of a shot
So I'm thinking what, is my neighborhood a trap
Could this be the place marked X on the map?
Now I'm spotted like a target, in the shooting gallery
So I start to seek for a better salary
So I can escape from where, from this ghetto life area
Cause everyday you're getting scarier
*blam blam* and scarier and scarier
Causing mass hysteria, it's drama
Talkin bout drama

Not to be bold and disrespect the homeless
Cuz I can see that they suffer from a long list
From not having shelter, and out on the street
Without a job and days without a bite to eat
Yo I feel for those, but here's another side
About some more people that's living on the outside
Because of the fact that they chose the wrong way
And it took em on a trip for a long day
Got to the point you started stealing from your house
Stalking the rooms late at night like a mouse
Your family's upset and you've got to go
When it's, five, below and we're ex-pecting snow
And then you're on the train with a cup in your hand
Kicking dirt, and making it look like sand
Then after you run that game for a while
You start sucking up tokens from out the turnstile
Are you that desperate, just to get a hit
Is it so effective that you won't quit, and yo
Why do you come to me crying the blues?
About you can't get a job, well, go sell some street news
Then you can get straight and be real
But you'd rather rob and steal
And that's drama
Talkin bout drama
Not wonderama
But I'm talkin bout drama
Hear what I'm sayin?
I'm not talkin bout your mama
Nahhhh, but I'm talkin bout drama

Shaolin fist versus the llama
Talkin bout drama




Out the window with that Range or that muscle car
Arm hanging out the window, diamonds in that big Chopard
Weed in the cracked cigar, more sour in the jar
Looking both ways, I'm cautious when I'm (drivin' 'round)
Hoodrats that's fresh, but barely feed their kids
Little kids that's killers and love doing bids
Unemployment lines, Mexicans'll work for nothing
You pray with them, but you don't know who that priest been touching
Liquour stores, strip clubs, filthy whores
Somebody daughter getting ten singles to drop her drawers
Crack fiends buy a new TV for 20 beans
Niggas tryna get money, police (drivin' 'round)
Blue flags, red flags, different gangs
OG's still outside, it never changes
McDonald's, chinese food, a thousand chains
I'm just tryna use my brains when I'm (drivin' 'round)


Step in the car and go
Round down by your lady, and I be waiting at the door
We 'bout to go (drivin' 'round)


Look, I'm fresh back from out of state, JFK arrival
A big spliff in my ashtray, July sunny day
And I'm feeling 'ight too, sliding through Medina
I done pushed everything, I love the way the Benz swing
So I turn my music up, caught a thought, wrote it down
I've seen him come back from outta town and get laid down
His music loud, windows down, summer heat vibing
It's live when I'm gliding, I'm smoking while I'm driving
Riding, mini skirts flirting while I'm passing, they waving
I'm leaning hard cruising, grooving to the beat
As I move through these mean streets
I beep at the seeds, stop, bless them with a little guap
I keep it rolling, picture me twirling the big truck
Yukon, my sheepskin shearling on the leather
It's a cold world, winter war weather
This is Wu-Block music for the black hooded champions


Step in the car and go
Round down by your lady, and I be waiting at the door
We 'bout to go (drivin' 'round)


What is the key to life, with no ignition?
Another jump start, then I'm on my mission
I keep ID, insurance, and registration
Wu music, good hemp for stimulation
Pull out the station, yield to pedestrians
Blacks, whites, Asians, Indians and Mexicans
At the light, a base head, fragile as a Pringle
He asks me "can I spare a change?" I throw up singles
He mimics my song that's on repeat
Addiction so strong, got him in knee deep
Button on his lapel, picture of Obama
Four years later we stuck in the same drama
These streets corners, just overcrowded saunas
Bigger losers drop weight, sweating from the trauma
Education to a thug is well debated
Each crime is kinfolk, all blood related


Step in the car and go
Round down by your lady, and I be waiting at the door
We 'bout to go (drivin' 'round)




Ohh mad one, we see your trap
You can never escape your fate
Submit with honor to a duel with my son
I agree

I see you're using an old style
I wondered where you'd learned it from
You know very well, it's yours too
Heh, I had forgotten, will you show me?
And what have you come for?
You come here, since you're so interested - fight me


Yo, Picture bloodbaths and elevator shafts
Like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft
Check the print, it's where veterans spark the letterings
Slow moving MC's is waiting for the editing
The liquid soluble that made up the chemistry
A gaseous element, that burned down your ministry
Herbal vapors and biblical papers
Smoking Exodus, every square yard is plush
Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions facial expression
Leaves impressions, try to keep a shark nigga guessing
Give crazy shouts Son here's the outcome
Cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss
Shit is outdated, just like neckloads of Sterlings
Suede-fronts, bell-bottoms, and tri-colored Shearlings
I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular homicides
On July 4th in Bed-Stuy
Where money don't grown on trees and there's thieving MC's
Who cut-throat to rake leaves
They can't breathe, blood splash, rushing fast
Like running rivers, I be that whiskey in your liver


Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!


This is not a '85 affair made clear
When the Gods get on to perform storms blew up
Wu's up, causing the crowd to self-destruct
Killer Beez are stinging while I reveal
Science that's heavily guarded by the culprit
Bombing your barracks with aerodynamic
Swordplay, poison darts by the doorway
Minds that's laced with explosive doses
Damaging lyrical launcher
Lunge at the youthful offender then injure
Any contender, testing the murderous Master
Could lead to disaster, dynamite thoughts
Explode through your barrier, rips the retina
Who can withstand the astonishing punishing
Stings to the sternum, shocked in the Hip Hop livestock
Seeking for a serum to cure em


Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Ducking handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move like real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six-oh
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Building lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, Ki's in they vaginas
No peace, yo the police mad corrupt
You get bagged up, depending if you're passing the cut
Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's living heartless
Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest
Individual, critical thoughts, criminal minded
Blinded by illusion, finding it confusing




Huh, Master, he must be dreaming, heh
Well, if he is dreaming then he must be asleep
And if he's asleep, then I will wake him up!

At the height of their fame and glory, they turned on one another
Each struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy
In the passion and depth of their struggle
The very art that had raised them to such Olympian heights was lost
Their techniques vanished




Dropping mad science on ya, nature caught breathless
Sounds so wavy, we eat quantum mechanics for breakfast

Y'all think you're sublime, all hot like a hero
We'll deposit your rhymes, down to absolute zero.

Let's ignite this battle, like that burner named Bunsen,
So hot to make fragile a molten metal even tungsten.

You've got no resistance, like a superconductor,
Like we're ballin' you out, in that famed park, Rucker.


Y'all ain't about this life, that pseudoscience you rhyming
These bars are so sharp, they'll cut through a diamond

I'll put some pep in your step, like taurine and caffeine,
Our rhymes are so sharp, they could slice sheets of graphene


Music, Music is for some people
Science, but science is for everyone
My science and your science .... my science and your science
I don't see what I would exchange science with
You're the one who lets me know what I am and who I became
Thanks to the ones who "discovered" science




If you want a solid, you gotta freeze it
If you want a liquid, you gotta melt it
If you want a gas, you gotta boil it
Yeah, that's called evaporation

Melting, heat in, that's endothermic,
Freezing, heat out, that's exothermic
Imaginable, but opposite in sign
Gas to liquid, that's condensation
Liquid to gas, that's evaporation
Yeah, it all depends on the solution,
For example, when I entered this nation,
Sweat on my forehead, looks like condensation,
The cold chill on my feet, like summertime ices
Trust me when I told you it wasn't too sweet
If you can't take the Heat, get out the kitchen, 'cuz it burns
ELLIS Prep, we the champs, (but you could call us) spurs

If you want a solid, you gotta freeze it
If you want a liquid, you gotta melt it
If you want a gas, you gotta boil it
Yeah, that's called evaporation


Started from a cell, now we're here
Started from a cell, now tissues and organs here
Started from a cell, now we're here
Started from a cell, now a whole organ system's here
Started from a cell, now we're here
Started from a cell, now a whole organism's here
Started from a cell, now we're here
Started from a cell, now 7 billion humans here

I done keep track of organelles
Nucleus -- cell's brain, DNA, lots of control
Now it wants to make proteins on its own
Engineering all day, that's the ribosome
Now getting tired, where's the energy at?
See mitochondria, get some ATPs out
More organelles here, now I gotta go
Out the cell membrane, small molecules can flow
'Cuz we...

Started from a cell, now we're here
Started from a cell, now tissues and organs here
Started from a cell, now we're here
Started from a cell, now a whole organ system's here
Started from a cell, now we're here
Started from a cell, now a whole organism's here
Started from a cell, now we're here
Started from a cell, now 7 billion humans here




Hahaha
Welcome
Time to shoot back down to the 36 chambers
The 36 chambers of death
Home of Wu-Tang Clan, WTC
I'll tell you this
All my Liquid Sword niggas
All my Cuban Linx niggas
Tical niggas
Those riding through the darkness with us
This is one official right here, I'm telling you that
Keep it 2000 with y'all
Flashnet nigga returns to the guillotine
Poisonous darts, shattering swords nigga
Cutting heads off, strangling
Word of my mother
Yes indeed, yes indeed
So we gon' hold court
Sit back, relax
Light your blunts, niggas
And listen

Once upon a time in Shaolin
The saga continues
Motherfuckers


My Lord don't you worry, I have a good idea
I'll get ahold of the Wu Tang sword manual
I'll get it for you
I don't care how, get that book




Two individuals, pulled from a lake
Inside a vehicle, one had his foot on the brake
The windows was fully up and the doors was locked
The news made the headline, and the town was shocked
The driver was clutching a can of Hi-C
His jacket was tied, to a nearby tree
His jeans had dye in them, an unusual tattoo
Was the only hope, to identifying them
The autopsies revealed gun shot wounds
Dental records matched to a newlywed groom
This accident, was a cover up for homicide
Two who might've stayed alive from paying bribes
Sheets investigators, had relied on the media
For help, and to track down the perpetrators
They canvassed the neighborhood, with standard procedure
And visited the home, of a topless skeezer
Who was at the bar, when he was last seen alive
Left with him, just ten minutes after they arrived
Despite the police efforts, they turned up nothing
Just an ex-hooker, try'nna get a rep from bluffing
But the wide publicity, had just paid off
From a hard rock inmate, who was just made soft
He said he knew a man who killed the pop star
And almost got caught by a passing cop car
The inmate said probably, the motive was robbery
And knowing this and keeping it a secret, it bothers me
He said this individual killed for low billings
And purchased a murder kit, blocks from the killing
The sheriff's office, had no time to waste
Plus the inmate made a deal to avoid the case
So he co-operated fully, and snitched on his
Chop shop mechanic, who used to move bodies on the pulley
An extortionist, involved in similar incidents
Payments that came in thousand dollar increments
Suspicious activities that flooded the place
So they subpoenaed phone records for the calls was traced
The hair that was taken from his car interior
Was that of a young girl, who felt inferior
She died fighting and probably aroused his anger
Holding off her life, as she faced the strangler
The crime seemed to be sexual from nature
It was substantial evidence, that the nigga raped her
The suspects had marks on his face and chest
But it just wasn't enough, to get an arrest
Asked of his whereabouts, on the third of July
Said he partied with his friends, and had a solid alibi
But it was really something left at the scene, on a small scale
Was the microscopic traces of blood, under her fingernails




Face the problems that everyone's found
We must replace what we took out of the ground
Face the problems that everyone's found
We must replace what we took out of the ground


The echo from machine gun rounds simmers
And a fallen soldier, his weapon hangs on his shoulder, lights get dimmer
Key swingin' back and forth in the ignition
The stench was only part of the horrible condition
As he waits for the smoke to clear
All he heard was the blast from in the bombs that kept ringin' in his ear
Along with gun-bearin' troops with fatigues and wearin' boots
From miles away, whether night or day they hear 'em shoot
It's a very unforgivin' and hostile environment
The military hardware, the only requirement
A world with a decease is just a thing of the past
Every advance is more costly than the last
The president's madness is responsible for losses
Political forces, land littered with corpses
Like the youth from the streets that gambled and get scarred
Even the troops in the field bet it all for one cause


Face the problems that everyone's found
We must replace what we took out of the ground


We grew up y'all, die-hard dummies, pourin' coke and guns
Violence was near so hallways were plungy
Dirty jean, hoodie on boys, stealin' stereos to get on
I did my first crime when I was born
Young king  realize
Life'll put you in a short spot, gun cocked, we was already signed
Day to day slingin', til once, we formed an ill line
Dynamic duos, all we did was threw O's
Police chased us in buildings, different places
This is real then, do me a favor, keep it from children
We was bad guys, stressin' for money
Regulate and start a strong clique, I was that nigga, don't forget
Time to time thinkin' 'bout time, little time left
Time piece is on, new Nikes, switchin' nines
In the buildin', pourin' out rhymes, don't let the cycle happen again
You might get trapped if you rewind




Staten Africa, move through the rat holes with the hunger
All the Jakes, look Archie Bunker
Scheme on your cracks, plot, and jump yah
I can't wait to get out, released from the barracks
So I can chop more , hunt gems
My army got lion's dens
See through your technology, advanced behavior
Renewal of the street mind, I speak mine
Little kids run through your hall, addicted to spray paint
Thugs clash with the unjust, it's untrust in these hallways
But love always, all of my dudes from back in the days
We 'place hard times with better ways
On some grown man shit, gettin' that child support paid
Never call out 
Mothafuck what you heard, it's the gods in here
Never slack on that music, it's very sincere






They was told not to ride in Patty's Hearse
And stay out of Charles' Mansion
Took Abraham's Lincoln through the Todd Bridges expansion
Willis Reeds a map that marks the spot showin
On his left George Burns a blunt William's Holdin
Tyra Banked the money that Chaka Khaned the poor
Alicia Keyed his car for givin Melba Moore
For the Redd Foxx who bought off the block, but though twice
As Debora Cox the gun cuz she beat Kelly's Price
When Rosa Parked the truck on the farm that Kim Fields
Linda Tripped for tryna to walk in Lauryn's Hills
Water dripped outta Farrah's Fawcett in the glass
She was "Superfly", Curtis Mayfield her ass
Chris Tucker to a show, Ted Turner to a ho
Robert Diggs the beat, but ain't feelin the flow
But he signed it fast, for half of Johnny's Cash
Nia Longed for the album to drop, cameras flashed
Tom Sawyer at the Lucielle Ball up at the foyer
He confronted Richard Pryor to hiring his lawyer
Suge's Knight removed the rook off the board
Donna King was checked and Al Sharpton the sword

"Wettin cream, I ain't wettin fame"
"(Fame is the measure)
"Rap celebs"
"The place where stars are born"


The saints marched in, Kurtis Blowing his horn
Tom Cruised the boulevard, Chris Rocked the song
For the hundredth time, they pressed rewind to the beginning
They toast to the rhyme, the juice spilt from John's Lennon
They took her to Elizabeth Taylor to dry clean
The lone seamstress, who was schemin on Al's Green
You know they shoot for the stars and buckwild
Like the kids in the yard who play with Jane's Child
A beautician laced Erykah's Badu
Sean Combed through the evidence, just to get a clue
The needle in the haystack, from outta Eartha's Kitt
The Tiger would kill him once thrown in Brad's Pitt
Jesse Owen the money from the weed Bubba Sparxxx'd
They was journeys seen far as he walked in Dick's Clarks
Jeffery Lyons stuck with a thorn from George's Bush
Paul Pierced in the heart as the crowd pushed
Acting alone... Drew Barrymore bones
Of the victims, three blocks from Jim's Brownstone
They shared the same bowl, he caught Natalie's Coled
The producer, threw the butter on Esther's Rolle
Nipsey Russeled him down, got his jaw wide
In a instant, Brooke Shields him from the gunfire
Angie Stoned him to death, with those vocals
Keith Sweat from the workout, just from runnin local

" Wettin cream, I ain't wettin fame "
"Fame is the measure"
"Rap celebs"
"The place where stars are born"


Larry's Bird flew outta Nicolas Cage
Joe Tex messages from Satchel's Paige
Betty Wright letters with ink from Sean's Penn
Infinite bars, you couldn't tell where the song end
Glenn Close enough to quickly duck the tapes
Richard Gere ripped while he was climbin Bill Gates
He was a southerner, posing as a, native New Yorker
The Jason Kidd took his first steps in Jimmy's Walker
He stayed on line chattin with rap celebs
Used Bernie's Mack to search Veronica's Webb
It cost them their life for the advice you gave
Now Pete Rose lay on Vanessa's Redgrave

" Wettin cream, I ain't wettin fame "
"Fame is the measure"
"Rap celebs"
"The place where stars are born"
" Wettin cream, I ain't wettin fame "
"Fame is the measure"
"Rap celebs"
"The place where stars are born"




Yo, yeah check it... yo, yo yo yo
Yo, if you think you can  with the Wu Clan
You get ya nose gets swolled up like Toucan
If you think you can  with the Wu Clan
You get ya nose swollen up like Toucan
If you think you can  with the Wu Clan
You get ya nose swollen up like Toucan Sam
And we don't give a damn
Bullets soaked in oil so the Tec can't jam


Sippin on Caribbean rum, coconut juice
Smokin on that chocolate stick
Open up two bottles of that brass monkey on some drunkie 
You R&B fake rappers suck a monkey 
I'm from back in the days, with the Christmas for haze
On my back, striped out black
You like that?; seven braids in my head
My girl stays in the bed and she love to lay the eggs


Prepare for the mic onslaught swift with the sword
Slick Lord, holdin my weight homing abroad
The crowd roared for the peeps playing for the streets
I reeped and sewed, scriptures weeved and woved
Behold gold for the people equal
Fresh on the weekend
Wu-Tang, Biggie Smalls live at the Beacon
Backstage drinks on the house the show was bangin
Brothers Grey Goosin, Wu was Tanqueraying
Allah teaching schools in session, the Gods speakin
I'm just knowledging
Snake handshakes and fake hugs
Waiting for the hour to devour
And splatter ya heads to powder
I'm a slave to the rhythm
But never to a mental deafened power
The hour has come
We got y'all eleven to one son
You done off, too late to break north
Tactics are hazardous to the health, bomb stealth
Rifle stay M-16, know what I mean?
Know what I mean?


Yo just what we (stand for?) Loyalty
What we strive for? Righteousness
What we live and (die for?)
Strictly fam members only

A-yo, a-yo, great minds think alike
We used to drink all night
Think about things that's wrong and how to make it right
Ice cold bottles of brass, time flashes
A hundred blunts passes
Before the God asked us
What's the square miles of the planet?
Why is the axis slanted?
How much is covered by water?
How much is granite?
True-I-Master-Equality, God body be
Flowing like the chi energy inside your artery
Faithful as a polished rock against a tank
The force of my will still kill shooting blanks
Just from the sound alone ya heads blown
Still scoring in the red zone you best of head home
Or get thrown to the dead zone, son we need to ill
Interrupt the Grammy show and teach the kids


Yo Just', what we stand for?
What we strive for?
What we live for?
What we give for?

I grew up around block parties ready to rock
Behind the rope  with my rhyme on cock
Verse shot first  to pop
The bad weather blew the feathers off a hundred flocks
Seventy-percent goose, thirty duck
Get stuck if each link in your chain is truck
Can't come in this rhyme cypher with nine snipers
Charge off the juice from the pied pipers
Grew up around B-Boys, DJ's, MC's
Through rap, never thinking their ways of TV
It was strictly all about about magnificent rhyme clout
The R.E.C. Room, two dollars with the flyer, three without
Now it's wigs pushed back, name's removed
Off the plaque, too wild to reenact
With tax, that's the price to pay, my goal is to
Aim and spray; my night is the same as day

 (x2)
Yo Just', what we stand for?
What we strive for?
What we live for?
What we give for?
What we die for?

Turn the track up a little bit
We need to rock in here

I wanna make you happy


I'm not at all happy or elated, this category ain't my favorite
It's my story, I'mma state it, you could love it or hate it
I'm just a misfit blessed with good dick and intelligence
Hood nigga holding no grudges on petty shit
I started, why are we cold-hearted, so guarded
Scared to get hurt, trying not to love the hardest
That's garbage, remember when we loved each other
Bathtub scrubbed each other, chillin', champagne spillin'
Uh, feelin' like the shit gon' last forever
Time went so fast, we had a blast together
Laughs we had, friends we spent time with
Now I be seeing your friends out, then I'm reminded
How we all used to gather up for the holidays
Now your friends all nervous to speak, they act afraid
I was your bestie, how it get to this
As I reminisce, takin' off my MJs in my empty crib
Mary...


I wanna make you happy
But you just don't see it
I wanna be around, babe
But I'm so tired of competing
We say all the wrong things
Till we make each other cry
What are we doing?
Will it ever get better?
My heart, my soul
I gave, it's yours
I can't get back
All the things that I lost
Boy, I love you
But you're pushing me away


I gave you everything that I got
Watched my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside


Now I was hoping
We'd get through this together
You said you'd love me
Through all types of stormy weather
Wasn't it you who said
We'd be together for all time
But it keeps messing with my mind
My heart, my soul
I gave, it's yours
I can't get back
All the things that I lost
I need you here near me
But I can't make you stay




I never thought that I would have this feeling
Do you think for once that you can truly mean it
Wasting so much time disagreeing
See, I'm to the point where I don't know what I believe in




If you don't want this, I don't want this, I do my morning crunches
Play my jazz, pray to the east, and watch the sunset
Uh, but yet I was blowin' you up the other night
Could tell your girl was telling you what to write back
Tell me why it's like that


So make up your mind, boy decide
We can't go on like this, this ain't right (it ain't right)
Feeling really bad, feeling kinda low
Think it's time to go






Yeah, yeah yo
I'm like a whirlwind spinnin wit words of wisdom
In the ghetto only promised a hearse and system
We complete like the solar system
Play your space, I get hungry off of treble and bass and beat breaks
Everyday be a court date recorded on tape
Hell Razah grab the mic and send your show to a wake
Cut off a snakehead the same way I cut off dead weight
We negotiate wit .38's in a north face
GZA came wit the Liquid Swords killin you all
I'm the virus in the street that'll get in your paws
See me jumpin outta four-doors wit my road dogs
All you soldiers want wars when you don't know laws
You be a rap fraud, knock you off the top of Billboard
Besides keyboards, only thing I love is the Lord
G-G, Maccabees, K-P be backin' me
Aiyyo Prodigal, niggas is charged wit blasphemy

Chorus 
AND ALL THAT HARD ROCK SHIT (charged wit blasphemy)
AND IF YOU'RE FEELIN LIKE AN ENEMY (come after me)


I heard the sweet words from sour tongues
Vent poison in the ears of the ?grown-z's? dead head for years
Shed a tear for the underwear under the stairs
Left naked in the shame from hunger and fear
Shots were fired in the darkest moments
Niggas missed they targets, hit the homeless when the chrome spit
Sacreligious, days of atonement
Sing a praise wit a peace pipe for niggas I zone wit
Priest I blow bread amongst twelve thugs
Drunk a cup of blood
We trained the same time Peter sprayed a slug
We all trapped in this dream scared to wake up
I seen a phantom whisper, grim shadows, shows a blurry picture
Streets are filled wit goons and bloody niggas
I seen my friend fall, clutchin holdin his stomach
Caught him off-guard, foldin his hundred
It's like a life never ends, never know when it's comin


Vocal imbalance, a code of silence converses violent
Live from medalion, ?nometry? dealin equality
You could stop to see profiles of me
Mic styles of me, lifestyles of me
Parallel prophecy, three-sixty degree
Complete the formation, salute the salvation
A Wu nation, do the knowledge no hatin
No misbehavin, lyrical affiliation
Artist in occupation together maintainin
Brain stainin, metaphor mutilatin
This generation, a misleading calculation
No elevation, time wastin and live chasin


A day and night crime scene, livin in the time machine
Blaze a lime green, six on the spleen over some green
Surrounded by crooks, a life wit jux and bloody heist
It's a deadly price but the gun fiend for ice price
In this hell puzzle filled wit bitches, money and trouble
Stitches, for dummy knuckles crummy fuckin up the hustle
It's a struggle, in jungle wit sin we fondle men
Plus a prison, ain't no division and no religion
And inner city chronicle, thugs get caught up astronomical
Stash phenomenal, blast at your abdominal
Niggas is comical, fuckin wit the abominal
Son, I promise you, you won't live to see tomorrow
Catch a slug in the back of your head at the Apollo
I'm a hard act to follow, rugged Smith like Rollo
(Let's mark that ass nigga)

Chorus 3x



I feel I'm a threat to high powered MC's
Cause when I roll up on their live shows they kinda freeze
From being approached by The Genius of rap
Whose poetry makes hands on a clock clap
You see, I be coming with strong rhymes galore
That even a stubborn MC can't ignore
That trying to defeat me brings about danger
Like a child speaking to a stranger
Soft MC's, I see more and more
With an ancient style, the prehistoric bore
Yes, they scream and roar until their throat get sore
Now they're running to the neighborhood drug store
To buy the cough drop for what? The wrong hip hop
Now they swear they're on the good ship lollipop
But it's a sweet trip to the candy shop
POW!, now it's a six feet drop
For stealin' rhymes which is incorrect
Of those who speak on how others are weak
You wanna sneak peek of the hype technique?
Don't make me run up on start flipping like
I'm insane, or you'll feel the pain

I appreciate your comments of my creation
Your standing up followed by your standing ovation
Your kindliness to listen to the true MC
Those who know me make me #1 cause they agree
I rock on and on past the break of dawn
Ask Rakeem, Unique Ason, or even Melquan
Cause I be flowing at the same time showing
Hard headed individuals who don't be knowing
That I wreck it, cause my style was perfected
And injected into a drop beat selected
By who? Easy-Mo-Bee, the engineer
But don't forget the hypest in the Northern Hemisphere
The G, the, The G, the, The Genius
From Earth, not Mercury or Venus
Or Mars, cause then I'll be martian
But even in that world I'll still be squashin'
Brothers who feel they have the heart
To battle me, then I'll just trip them apart
Don't make me run up and start flippin' like I'm
Insane, or you'll feel the pain




My life rest in a .45, aim for the head, chest fortified
Sons look for revenge, out of stress, daughters cry
Gotta do it here, can't afford to try
Thought the gutter ended in the 'Ville, then I saw the 'Stuy
They get wet daily, it's a live nigga water ride
Slow and steady win the race, step aside, let the tortoise by
It's the hunted man, street value hundred grand
Instinct, nothing planned, been through shit you couldn't understand
Cain, Hec, and Dawuan - I'm repping the lifeless
Weapon of crisis, guns run out, I'm steppin' in
Checkin' for secondary devices, live in the real world
Fuck bitches, get love from a real girl, raised my sister
Amongst the slime and the crime, now she a ill pearl
You never seen nothing like me, I'm for those who get it on nightly
You need a boost of strength, put it on, recite me
I tour with toast, cuz drama's always close
Feeling the waves, kill the praise, applaud my folks
From the core, the most raw, absorb the quotes
For sure I'm the cure, and there's more of the dose
Yeah, I'm from the bottom but I look forward to gross


In the gutter, some ride, some chill (some chill)
I'm from the gutter, some 'Stuy, some 'Ville (some 'Ville)
Know many brothers, some cry, some build
Word to the mother, some lie, some steal (steal)
Some get popped, some die, some heal (some heal)
Some get knocked, some hide and some real
(Some even bust shots, some live, some kill)
(But that's gutter where Ka and them chill)


Slim nigga with the fat pound, back down
Most brolic dude, try to move, hit him in the face
Never again taste solid food. Same nigga
If I'm in solitude, or with the wildest crew
Bulletproof down my coats like Ghost's wallets, too
I run wit a crook or two, look who escaped out Brooklyn Zoo
Fuck that queen, I show you what a knight, and a rook'll do
New York City Bronson, heat up quicker than Vinnie Johnson
The block got Bloods now, it's like a mini Compton
To have honey smiling, need money piling
Bundles, bundles, bundles, a hundred thousand
That's why with my gun I'm browsing
On the hottest strip to see who I gotta hit to start running housing
I listen to my id, respect my ego
If I need council, bounce through, check my people
The first on Earth with the same thirst I accept is equal
Never move with crews, you'll lose, they steps beneath you
I rep it lethal in beef, might elect to mesquite you
From where the beast greet you, do as much as dirt as us, but they preach lethal
The block is class, the blast from the heat teach you
Get one lesson, fail, oh well, the streets keep you
Pat his jeans, one magazine, sheet sleep you




I embody, every nigga who carried a shotty
Forced to grow up quick, never sat on the potty
Went from crawl to run, we want all or none
Being fatherless bothered us, everybody we called 'em son
Block scholastic, sellin chips from the rock jurassic
For heavy glory, mark territory 'fore I rot in casket
Thought our young committee was gon' run the city
One fears being unprepared, so I brung the Smitty
If you dare come and get me, I'm from royalty
I represent myself, don't need no lawyer fee
People call on me, cuz I'm ready when it's urgent
Too much grace to tremble, hand steady as a surgeon



[Mashup of Labels by GZA from Liquid Swords
And
Floating Boy by Fugazi from End Hits]




Tommy ain't my motherfucking boy
When you fake moves on a nigga you employ
We'll all emerge off your set, now you know God damn
I show living large niggas how to flip a def jam
And rough up the motherfucking house cause I smother
You cold chilling motherfuckers, I still warn a brother
I'm ruthless my clan don't have to act wild
That shit is jive, an old sleeping bag profile
The soft comedian rap shit ain't the rough witty
On the reel to reel it wasn't from a tough city
Niggas be game, thinking that they lyrical surgeons
They know they microphone's a virgin
And if you ain't boned a mic you couldn't hurt a bee
That's like going to Venus driving a mercury
The capitol of this rugged slang is Wu-Tang
Witty unpredictable talent and natural game
I death row an MC with mic cables
The epic is that I rush associated labels
From east west to atco, I bring it to a next plateau
But I keep it phat though, yo
I'm hitting batters up with the wild pitch style
I even show an Uptown MCA style
Who thought he saw me on 4th & Broadway
But I was out on the island, bombing MC's all day
My priority is that I'm first priority
I bone the secret out a bitch in a sorority
So look out for A&M, the Abbot and the Master
Breaking down your pendulum
As I fiend MC's out with a blow that'll numb the a-
-ppendix, I'm holding more more weight than Colombia
Index Interscope, we RCA, clan
That's coming with a plan to free a
Slave of a mental death MC don't panic
Throw that A&R nigga off the boat in the Atlantic
Now who's the bad boy character, not from Arista
But firing weapons released on Geffen
So duck as I struck with the soul of Motown
My central broadcasting systems is low down
And dirty, like that bastard
It's getting drastic


Read the label and say it loud
Another Wu banger
Thirty-six chambers, through your area
Read the label and say it loud
Another Wu banger
Thirty-six chambers, through your area
Another Wu banger






Got me doing all the things I said I wouldnt do
And all my other girls be looking like who the fuck is you
Jealous on the time weve been standing
Cause they dont hold my interest, I cant help it


I fucks with you, I fucks with you
I fucks with you, I fucks with you
I fucks with you, girl I fucks with you


You got me strong girl, keep me coming back
Oh youre my fun girl, we be kicking back
Youre like my homie, except youre fine as hell
Except youre fine as hell, Mama cooking these well
You got that whole cake, so I blow you out
We spend the whole day, we might never leave this house
Youd be tripping on these chickens
Trying to get all up in our business
You keep it tight, I salute you
That body right, I applaud you






When its you and its me we dont got nobody to impress
Just sex, no stress, cant say the same about my ex
When I call, you pick up your phone
When I call you know its time to go
I aint gotta say, you already know, you already know to keep me on the roll
You got a girl crush on Cassie, uh you so nasty
Its okay I like it, that shit get me excited
Bitch you so crazy and dont take that personal
Cause you know youre my baby






You got me strong, girl
Oh, youre my fun girl
Youre like my homie
Except youre fine as hell
Except youre fine as hell








Planets spinnin all around me
Galaxy Surround me
It's astronomy


Jupiter's a gassy planet, along with Saturn
Ask me how I know? I follow the stars pattern
Turned around Saturn and ended up on Mars
And the surface of the planet was cold like these bars
Standing on Mars, my hands started to freeze
Cause the surface temperature was minus 63 degrees
Left the cold in my soul on a quest to get heated
Swerved around the zodiac and ended up Venus


Bright as the phoenix, the temperatures so hot
I'm wildin out a lot
Volcanoes is all it's got
Strapped on my oxygen, to avoid the carbon
Dioxide Im getting dehy-
Drated, so I waited, a minute I contemplated
My patience was getting faded, from this journey I created




Hesitate on a planet that dont count  PLUTO
Other schools like that planet -- dont count cause YOU KNOW I'm
Shining like a diamond flying to the planet next to me
Closest to the sun so it means that I'm on Mercury
Certainly, I'm bout fly to Neptune
Mad moons, then it hit me with the dark blue
Color
I dont shudder
When I see the stormy weather. But its whatever..
When I'm chillin on uranus - PAUSE
Tilted downward dog
Been to all the planets so here our last search
Blue seas and pollution we're talkn about EARTH!




Castle, Qc2
If black takes on c4, then white could play e4



I must put in time to get mine, many hours to earn power
Like the ashy hand pizzeria owner that rolled flour
I can't be a broke nigga, bitter and sour
Sellin' CDs on the corner of Sunset and Gower
A small fry nigga in a baked potato world
Sizzling in some beef full of grease like jheri curls, uh-uh
Shout out to DJs who kept it real
Shipped a few hundred thou' but some never broke the seal, fuck them
Stick to college radios, mix shows
Stormin' university with freestyles, sick flows
Might give a lecture about your rap texture
MC, B-Boy, DJ / Director
The name was a bell that rang through the hall
Popular as the tag on the bathroom stall, check it
This language is so captivating
When we lose a rap nigga the news is devastating
Whether to the prison or grave
You know this rap shit is built from the strength of those that hunger and crave
My clan got rhymes for days, to be skilled it pays
Most of them can't escape the solar rays




Name a crew that can stop the force that I strike wit
Let alone try to hold the pen that I write wit
You can even chop off my fingers I type wit
Those I hold a mic wit, thinking I might quit
They didn't know that only makes me more determined
Ich lebe fr hip hop, you can ask the Germans
Some say I never got this full recognition
So I drop another, they shocked and still listen
Plus I ran into a well-known musician
He said this sample shit got too many cooks in the kitchen
Now he's back to flippin' love borns and cypher zigs
To support his kids, much even hyper wiz
A bad amigo will stroke your ego
You see the flash on the dash when he blast your Buick-Regal
The same brother you was throwin' your key to
Brought the seven niggas in the buildin' to see you
You know these goddamn streets 's so gritty
With sour milk from titties that'll spoil the city
The hood cornerbacks, strong attack is a blitz
But we don't lie down for shit, not even direct hits


From graffiti in New York on the walls and trains
DJs in California to the shores of Maine
B-Boys on the floor who be doin' the thang
To MCs behind ropes who had titles to claim


My team's about shootouts, the fans shout with loud mouths
The clock run out, the ref throw the sign, it's overtime
The rim-leanin', visitin' teams schemin'
Championship ring fiendin', they must be dreamin'
These rap players and slayers got a lotta endorsements
Make 'em hire law enforcement
Plus I just turned down tracks, can't remember the
Producer with the beats is wack, sound similar
It gotta be exciting, striking, lightning
Bring the best out, to dawn through Harlem
Writing, light stroke from my pen might choke
The tape lent, got a little air, then half the spins
MCs be stuck with fear and fascination
The nature and the scale of events shake the station
I stick up the track armed only with the pen
Terrorize it vocally with the force of wind



This is hip-hop


Castle, Qc2
If black takes on c4, then white can play e4)

C5, Qa5, e5, Nd5, Bxc4, Nc3, and then castle




Yeah, know what I'm saying?
Wise Intelligent, broadcasting live from the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro
Know what I'm saying?
Hip hop go wherever I go
For real, Poor Righteous Teachers represent
'96 off the hook we're dropping this hit kid
Watch


Lord, how you be, madam G, peace God
Fuck frauds, get yours, kick ass, leave scars
On Mars I built a school to study life on Earth
Thoughts burst, a million rappers murdered in the first verse
Now what's worse than eating dirt, being buried alive
Put to death by surprise in the name of black gods
Ain't I most fly? Young pie don't cry
Dry the tears from your eye and your lover might live
Life to give, life to take, never making mistakes
All wise enjoying everything right and exact
Poor facts, pro-black, Donnelly Homes projects
Learn that time is the same on Casio or Rolex
Knowledge James, chapter two, verse one through six
But try not to judge a man by the price of his kicks
Come off this talk shit  convert words to actions
Cause you know Jersey runs things every time boy
Build destroy, Trenton must make noise
Enjoy the fruits of life, need the wife and my boys
My seed won't need for anything, trust me
Black man, 'nuff land, eight hundred acres of trees
Please the seven seas travel regularly
Degrees consciously study everywhere we be
Family daring he who talks enough shit
And come and get the stitch to fix the split upper lip
The shit providers
Will call us great civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers black


Whatever happened to the Gods and the Earths
They thirst for a pot of gold God's worth is birth
Knowledge is worth more than diamonds
When the mind is shining, surprise us
Gods Earths and 85ers


Dedicated to the Gods and the Earths
Dip dip dive-a, civilize an 85er


Intelligent, twenty-three, now nineteen five
Hold the mic I'll rise right in front of your eyes
In here six years see what I felt every year
Oh yeah it's ninety-six I'm born and understanding, understood
Get the goods, build a school down south
In some remote location that nobody knows about
Teach, add on to the life that we live
God degree, twelve jewels, eat the foot that I give
No pig, strictly kosher mathematics and fact
Poor blacks on track mission to take the Earth back
Cause Whitey got it locked, that's why the whole world's lost
We wearing crowns made of thorns and being put to the cross
Lost souls futures told in the Dead Sea Scrolls
God reduced to a savage lacking soul control
Talking lots of shit about his drugs and guns
Several daughters, 'nuff sons, ain't trying to raise none, yo
Whoa-ho-ho, let me slow up with the flow
Can't move too quick because niggas got to know
The duty of the civilized is to civilize the uncivilized
And make the world recognize
That God is Wise, and Wise is God to the death
And back to life, you Lazarus and I'm the Christ
The forthcoming, like a thief in the night
The wave of light, the key to everlasting life
That shit provide us, to call us straight civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers y'all


Whatever happened to the Gods and the Earths
They thirst for a pot of gold God worth his birth
Knowledge is worth more than diamonds
When the mind is shining, surprise us
Gods Earths and 85ers

 (x2)
Dedicated to the Gods and the Earths
Dip dip dive-a, civilize an 85er


Since I've been away I've been thinking about
How gunslingers turned singers and black culture went out
Wake up all you teachers tired of teaching and wait
Grass roots, pass truth into the ears of black youths
Watch me talk the talk and walk the walk right now
As mystic as it seems, I bring for real to your dream seeing
Midnight marauder got it dipped off the block drug
Street niggas bug cause they know we do it for the love
We rose above every limit that they said we had
Who loves your ass enough to strictly educate the mass?
Come get your cash, fill your mind with swine and dash
For longevity, these niggas we will never be
You will remember we from now till forever G
I am infinity, lyrics flowing endlessly
You ain't no friend to me so don't even pretend to be
Like O.J. Simpson be sleeping with the enemy
I call you out and make the world know your ass is lacking
Quoting some lessons but see no parts of understanding
You standing under my rain, snow, sleet, hail and thunder
That's why you wonder what's causing this to exist
I raise the mist, distill the myths of many currents
Don't be determined except to life forget the death
Nevertheless you're being blessed cause I'm who God is
Don't know the time niggas must be wearing Guess watches
Hands on your boxes, turn 'em up like seven notches
Your Magnavoxes amplify my super conscious
Shit providers, we'll call us straight civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers y'all


Hold it down kid and you don't stop
P.R.T. represent shop
(There's a new set of rules you shall all have to abide by
And the non-lyrical shall be terminated)




Aiyo shorty, yo that's my word
Oh, y'all smelling y'all piss now y'all think y'all gold
Yo anybody get caught flinging over here
I'm returning 'em, that's my word they getting blasted
Anything from 220 to 140, that's mine
Y'all need to step the fuck off
Y'all niggas ain't crazy for real


Yo, the fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you


I'm deep down in the back streets, in the heart of Medina
About to set off something more deep than a misdemeanor
Under the subway, waiting for the train to make noise
So I can blast a nigga and his boys,for what?
He pushed up on the block and made the dope sales drop
Like the crash in the Dow Jones stock
I had a connect to cross-sales, to catch more mill's
Than ho-bitches got birth control pills
I'm in the park setting up a deal over blunt fire
Bum nigga sleeping on the bench, they had him wired
Peeped my convo, the address of my condo
And how I changed a nigga name to John Doe
And while we set up camp, we got vamped
Put the stake through his heart, I ripped his fucking fangs apart
Snake got smoked on the set like Brandon Lee
Blown out the frame like Pan Am Flight 103
He got swung on, his lungs was torn
A kingpin just castled with his rook and lost a pawn
A regular on the block that played lookout
For preying predator with a Glock, he should have took out


No neighbourhood is rough enough
There is no clip that's full enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you
Fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you


It's mandatory that I supply all my troops with mega firearms
Big apes and spread 'em out like crops on a farm
To get cream, sometimes they repaint the scene
Like the last episode on gates, and other niggas
Plant bombs till the smoke from the blast becomes thick
And flows through, all they knew, he's gun sick
His Glock clicks like high-heeled shoes on parquet floors
Mad sick, stand on hills and invade wars
Filthy foul, shovelling dirt, he's out to hurt
For instance, chop off hands, attack worth
His idols would lock down airports and extort
Some import, catching ten percent of what the fiends snort
Up in the ski resorts, up in hills
They move keys and had the skis making drops on snowmobiles
The plan was to expand, catch seven figures, release triggers
And live large and bigger than my nigga
Who promised his moms a mansion with mad room
She died and he still put a hundred grand in her tomb
Open wounds, he hid behind closed doors
And still organizes crime and drug wars


Fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you
No neighborhood is rough enough
There is no clips that's full enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you
There's no cuffs that's tight enough
There is no niggas that's fuck with us
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you




I'm in the schoolyard rhyming with my brother Jamel and Ra' Allah
Vibe and took the beat, and imagining how far
The sound travel at the turn of the volume
It could shake the gravel, before we heard the loud boom
It vibrated through the parking lot
Shattered a few windshields, set off a sparking shot
The local UPS cat, but we didn't stress that
He had a slow leak, front tire almost flat
I got a cousin think he slicker than the oil in the chain
But I live in an arcade, surrounded by game
He used to pass me bucks, trying gas me up
He was a fast talker, and he kept a flashy cut
From a spot that was on Malcolm X Boulevard
Where this magician, wishing I would pull a card
An optical illusion, and whose hands were quick
But wasn't fast enough not to reveal his trick


Who be the first to set it off and just begun
Turn up the heat until the track is done
And we roll together as one
Yes, I call my brother son, cuz he shine like one

 (Justice Kareem)
Mass hysteria inside the cafeteria
(Not a food fight, but the news might) beat your area
Whether by word of mouth, or if you read about it
(Extra extra, they felt the need to shout it)
(The drummer played the beat on) the table
His boy kicked a verse, like he was the first (and I wasn't able)
More prepared to let off anything substantial
(If I had no rhymes and my planes was cancelled)
Picture that, before you give your bag and expose it
(Couldn't develop the color, wonder why he chosed it)
(See less than the worst competition, to the point)
I only use one ear to listen
Was it something I'm missing (the food is getting cold)
The corners about to flake (as soon as I flip the bowl)
(See the rhyme ain't worth the lunch ticket)
Waste of time of mine (plus the temp kicked it)






Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
The special technique of shadowboxing


Poisonous, poisonous (word word word)
I should slap all y'all niggas for coming in my fucking face with that shit
Alright cool yeah, go ahead man...
Poisonous


Poisonous paragraphs smash your phonograph in half
It be the Inspectah Deck on the warpath
First class leaving mics with a cast
Causing ruckus like the aftermath when guns blast
Run fast, here comes the verbal assaulter
Rhymes running wild like a child in a walker
I scored from the inner slums abroad
And my thoughts are razor sharp, I sliced the mic from the cord
First to criticize, but now they have become
Mentally paralyzed with hits that I devise
Now I testify, the rest is I
Rebel INS Your Highness, blessed to electrify
With voltage of a eel, truth that I reveal
Will crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real
Caesar black down, hoodied up in fatigues
Part time minor leagues receive third degrees
Attack like a wolf pack once I pull back
The God-U and bust through like a fullback


Yo, you fourteen carat gold slum computer wizard
Tapping inside my rap vein causes blizzards
The wildlife that kills for ice trife like by the digits
Gorillas injected with strength of eighty midgets
The Earth spins, whirlwinds, rap exotic blends
Let my peeps in, niggas gasping, swallowing aspirins
With a dosage, you overdosed in rap
High explosives, my posters hypnotize with hypnosis
I sell goods, my whole Clan is on the run like Natural Born Killers
Record-breaking the album Thriller
Got access to tear gas, bombs and rocket launchers
Flow like dough, Killa Beez is what I sponsor
Your entrepreneur, pens in gear like Shakespeare
When I fuck I grab hair, collect drawers as souvenirs
Fuck yeah, my crew down German beers
My career's based on guns, throwing cats in wheelchairs
Etcetera, damage any lame ass competitor
Who try to front, get broken in fast like leathers
Whatever hot hardheads get shattered like mirrors
Beretta shots splatter your goose, scatter your feathers
Say never poetry chumps crumbs deal with graphic
Flew my family overseas, I'm maxing
If rap was crack, fully packed I be tall cats
Taxing kingpin of the rap drug trafficking
Village niggas get slapped in Manhattan
For rapping, Big Ghost steps off laughing
Ha!


Were you just using the Wu-Tang school method against me?
I've learned so many styles, forgive me


Sit back relax, fake niggas don't get turns
Watch me massage your brain with slang that's king
Projects filled with young men cause threats
Who has that? Thousand dollar chains and Tecs
Focus, the brokest niggas of life shit
These mics is like cocaine son, check the suicidal hype shit
Exchange mad blunts taste the sweepstakes
Keeping up on fakes outta state for cakes
No doubt, plus nobody amount, we making dough off
Putting fifty on the Land and Allah, it's like that
Pull ya shoes up black, matter of fact just adapt
Tie up, your black Nikes and tight hats
Corners stay surrounded with foreigners
What up, dread? Feds caught your bredren for his bread
But regardless, peace to jail niggas with charges
Unify laying in the yard with La
My Clan done ran from Japan to Atlanta with stamina
Slingers and gamblers and gram handlers
Tical light the Owl cigar, let's get steamed
Infra-red guard your beam, so seek 'nough respect
Rude bwoy you bet, keep it moving Mashallah
Pro black like tar
Designing the fly shit and stay shining
The RZA pour more beats than Cristal's fine wine
Concrete raps go to bat
With 50 other niggas on the other side of the map
Knew it's all good and all done what, we want son
Mike Tyson of this rap shit, pulling out Macs for fun


The nigga don't get mad, I got mad styles of my own
And it's shown when my hands grip the chrome microphone
Verbally I catch bodies with cordless shotties
Intriguing MCs, I keep em trained like potties
I bomb facts, my sword is an axe
To split backs invisible, like dope fiend tracks
Sky's the limit, niggas are timid and nobody knows
How we move like wolves in sheep clothes
Producing data, microchips of software
Underground and off air
The Land of the Lost, notorious henchman from the North
Striking niggas where the Mason-Dixon line cross



(feat. RZA & GZA)


Yo... before the Greeks and the creeks..
It's an old Pete Rock classic, nigga, yo


Before the Greeks and the creeks, before you can stand
Before your hands and your feet, from a band or a beat
We would stand on the street, with our hands on our heat
Twelve grams, twelve feet away, balled up in a sheet
Of Reynold's wrap, one smack, leave's your dentals back
Your voice get quiet like the voice in the instrumental track
Slick from the lip lisp, son, sip the citrus
My voice unfolds, with the soul of The Whispers
On the block, we rock loud like The Pistols
Up in the crib, my wiz drinkin' a Harvey's Bristol
Natural flavor, yours be artificial
I blow holes in skin, like big nose through snotty tissue
They go berserk, when the dollar dollar bill is on
The thrill is gone... upgrade to the silicone
That's birth of four billion, eight hundred milli-on
It's not official until I smack the W, silly on
From the valleys of Ohio, to the sounds of Cairo
Still hit, like the whirlwind kick of Ryu
Zig-Zag-Zig Allah, still puzzled like the jigsaw
You renig', you get jinxed, pa, Pete Rock exclusive..


We boat guard the road, like trucks on the turnpike
Smoke by the load, just to see what it burns like
Architectural design, intellectual rhyme
Official stripe, movin' on a diagonal line
With thugs trapped, scholars they want the books back
The piece, they turn us off, the moment they look back
The castling position, made weak by a wind calm
Knights lose armor from the pressure, we bring on
And fire all these shots in the rhymes with mad flames
Kept the cramp game, and he posted on bad squares
The king's the kick, the queen's the snare
The bass are minor pieces that move in a pair
Quick to break through, an un-parallel opponent
I do it on the regular, at any given moment
Check the venue, those to make the saga continue
Before you check the credits, the swords is all in you
It's real... it's real... it's real... it's real...

Knights lose armor from the pressure we bring on
They fired all these shots in the rhymes with mad flares
Kept a cramped game, many posted on bad squares

Yeah, we on a high stake game right now my G
No foots allowed, you understand?


I dribbled in Philly, doubled down in Vegas
Tripled off a nickel, down in Talladega
Tipped the oath, blood, money and smoke
And I swear the state wrote any rhymes that I quote
Here on now's about, stuffing the couch
Making sure that shit is slammed right in your mouth
I'm laying on cellophane bags stuffed in vials
Palms got itchy cause my girl blew trial
Checking for funny money purple life a marked bill
Throw your dick in the dirt for chopped grills
Open like a market of fleas and from
11-7, son if you copping for trees
And I'm only fucking with 20s and Z's
If you get the wrong idea, you better come with the D's
Cause the bank won't stop and the bank won't freeze
A double dose of process and 4 g's


I spent a lot of time on the bounce to get it right
Stay rough around the edges like a bare-knuckle fight
Call me Smokey Robinson when I write as I'm a journal
I keep the burner tucked, deep inside the thermal
And the way I hear you talking to me is irrelevant
My laser sharp speech, makes me relevant
Makes the ground shake like a gang of elephants
And I came with mathematics, supreme intelligence
So I can mix it in the pot and watch the rocks just melt
Or put holes on the block it's just a notch on my belt
Or invest in new bubbles watch it rock it and sell
When the pockets start to swell, I'm taking that lane
Hit the button doors open like butterfly wings
And the sound system jumping on the summertime thing
And we always up to something when the temperature's hot
At the Maldives island watch the landing gear drop


Lyrical battles I identify with
I load up and exploit this fly gift
The clip is filled with 16 bars
Lead hits the paper so the loose leaf scarred
The mic booth is bulletproof
Anger and frustration, auto fire from hooded youths
In the darkest area assassin down to bury ya
Decode a message from the fastest carrier
This craft of trade with a sharp blade
A double-edged sword give life in dark fades
Turn murderous rap only means I killed it
Up close and personal, Wu-Tang we filled it
Mic masters Hip Hop's hallmark
The Big Bang of rap and the center was all dark
Then came the spark and we begin to rhyme
And shine light on the world in the form of art





Yes the good life, you know *sound of glass clinking*

What the fuck is that, Hell's Angels?

Ahh Mr. Bobby Steels, Tony Starks on the line one for Mr. Bobby Steels


Steels over here, Steels over here
Peace, Starks what's going on baby?
Yeah everything is lovely over here
Yeah Maximillion didn't show up yet
I'm over here with Noodles and I got Lucky Hands with me

[GZA}
You got soul, R&B, classics?  All that shit right?


Yeah, Greco is right in front of me right now
Greco is standing right here
Yeah he has a briefcase; ohh, OK, OK I got you
Aight thanks


Bobby Steels

Mr. Greco, good to see you good to see you good to see you

A pleasure

So is everything OK, is everything working as we planned?


So is everything OK, is everything working as we planned?


Everything is working out, very nicely
Do you have the cash, twenty-thousand dollars?

Do we have the cash?  We don't have to talk that, hey hey


Get the fuck outta here with that Hell's Angels bullshit!


We got the cash, you know Cash Rules Everything Around this Motherfucker
Umm, let me ask you...


The fuck outta here!


Do you have the full amount?  Twenty thousand as we agreed upon?


Fucking hell's bastards

Let me ask you a question Mr. Greco...
Do you know a a Don Rodriguez?

I know no such person

Don Rodriguez from the Bronx? Don Rodriguez?

I don't know who you're talking about


I think you do know him cause your fuckin friend Don is down at One-Twenty Precinct right now singing his fuckin ass like a fuckin bird
The fuckin guys is comin


Do you believe him?



Life of a drug dealer
Killah hills 10304


Restaurant's on a stake-out so order the food to take out
Chaos outside of Sparks Steak House
Maintain the power, I feel the deal's gone sour
Nigga missed a wedding, late a fucking half hour
And his man who bought land from Tony Starks
While he was contracting bricklaying jobs in city parks
He's a loan shark, bitches raise a grand to a finger
In the garment district, got it sewn like Singers
Cause all that talk blasphemy this kid after me
For the heist, in a Burlington coat factory
Fuck it, he turned state's on my nigga Castro this co-pilot
Who used to drop rice sacks of blow
On this remote area we label Dead Man's Island
Two hundred miles South from Thailand
Right off the docks, I got luxurious custom made yachts
Burial plots, for my niggas hit with fatal shots
There's no need for us to spray up the scene
I use less men, more powerful shit for my team
Like my man Muhammad from Afghanistan, grew up in Iran
The nigga runs a neighborhood newsstand
A wild Middle Eastern, bomb specialist
Initiated, at eleven to be a terrorist
He set bombs in bottles of champagne
And when niggas popped the cork, niggas lost half they brains
Like this ex-worker, tried to smuggle a half a key
In his left leg, even underwent surgery
They say his pirate limp gave him away
As the feds rushed him, coming through U.S. Customs
Now look whose on the witness stand singing, a well known soprano
A smash hit from Sammy Gravano
Here's the plan minimum for the hit, two hundred grand
Half time at the game blasting niggas out the stands
The sharp-shooters hit the prosecutor, judges are sent
Photographs of they wives taking baths
Along with briefcase filled with one point five, that's the bribe
Take it or commit suicide
First rule, anyone who schemes on the gold in Syria
I want they small intestines ripped from they interior
I got a price for those jewels, ship 'em freight cargo
Don't forget to launder the cream through Wells Fargo
Reconstruct those processing plants for the call of Costa Rica
Four hundred barrels of ether
Two hundred pounds of reefer and fifty immigrants with fake Visas



The saga continues




I wiped the chrome off with the dust cloth before I bust off
What's the cost, life loss?
High price to pay for a small reward
Kill for that Bushwick and Horsely broad
I provided the jumper cables through the booster mini-packs
Based on the drama unfolding in the track
I don't hold back, I spare no one
Swords swing like shogun, now who want it?
You see the truth, then act upon it
Or feel the fire's full view
Ain't a MC that I hit can pull through
Y'all niggas are like kids, flashing plastic tools
Unaware of the multi-year dynastic rule
What?! Stupid!


Without a doubt, it's in the heart
Where the best darts were written
Sitting at the window of the Grand Old Earths
Youths thirst for knowledge, I teach but hold heat
Cause some savage niggas are lost beyond reach
Broken homes breed seeds of no guidance
Left to wander the streets and experiment with devilishment
Violent, felon offenders, supreme folders
One-twenty bomb holders let 'em off and explode
The battlefield haunting, the daunting
Wu-Tang dance, deadly emits six pence
Spiral, rifle barrel pointed, elastic noose
Plastic head wrap stifle, survival
Tribal, title - Secret Rival
Article subliminal message throwing
Bitch niggas hoeing on labels
Mic cables, capable of slowing down jets on deck
Fucking you straight through continuously
Justice, the war of the critical penital
Some long overdue, now served by the chiefs on cheat
Drama builds, it's the street prophecies fulfilled
Bitter chill currents to the invited
Bang for the phones, live niggas on their way home
Snatch poems from clones, we got it sewn




An MC stepped to me, lying about one
Kid that rolled with him who died in the outcome
Thinking he could get with me, gain victory
When the season's all on his beef was hickory
The situation at hand still remained critical
The check analytical, reaction was pitiful
He pushed his pawn up, yo that's a wrong move
A hog move, some rap cat on dog food
Microphone competition we devour
You pull plugs but take no source of power
Cause then in MCing, the contours of the land
Intricate architects that's linked to a plan
The W U hyphen T A N G
My rap flow automatic and never empty
Don't tempt me, quick to bust off another
Flee in that direction you could get it from my brother
At least then you know that you up against G-O-D
So when we throw those grenades you better be
Ready, not iced out and petty
Neckful couldn't match one oil drop from Getty
That's ran by the icon who just left Exxon
And spilled oil so he could cash checks on
The strength cause local niggas be hating
But the sound still travels from state to state and
No dress code, boot, hats and all metal
Strictly hip hop underground and all ghetto
So catch it, throw it on your plate and scratch it
Mix that 


Stick it up like it's a highway robbery
True gangstas we run New York City
We come fi takeover the industry
Cause you know them have fi too 'fraid of we


How come so much rap  sound so similar
Is it confusing for you to remember the
Originator, paint sprayer, crafts innovators
Quick close ups of the artform's life savors
From tapes to decks, beats with raps, streets with gats
Speaking of tracks, I've ran plenty laps
The crates were packed, Farms were Phat
Thieves would chat to stab my back, detect many traps
Hazardous enterprise, the youths energized
Not seeing the truth till it's in your eyes
Burning, you learning to power your rhyme
Exert maximum damage in minimum time
Road L's are lit, my spears start to hit
Strange translation of words of wit
Through the cable transmit' and once the shoe fit
Unlock the secret of prophecies and that's it
Stay submerged deep as we cruise the seas
Beneath the Surface just like Adidas and Lee's
Or a croke head that used to walked the length
From Brooklyn to get a beat on 43rd and 10th
And that's just a short trip to flip without a whip
Tried to shop this most extravagant gift
To a cat who wasn't hemped and never opened doors
Till he accidently seen it on the shelves of stores
That's more frightning than strikes of lightning
Tearing up the storm in your average college dorm
So think about it when you trying to flow
When you wanna step to us I think you should know






You crunchy chump crabs get crumbled up like crack rock
Fuck with the Wu, we busting ya whole snot box
Million white ears and your bitch up in a zip lock
From Spazzola to this purest form of hip-hop


Here's something to advertise
Promoter keep the fans satisfied
Load data for the disc drive, ghetto citywide
Leave 'em paralyzed, they stolen every word I provide
Without no clearance, I nurture this track like I'm its parents
Got requestments from retail stores for my appearance
First we target it, then they market it to kill your artist with
My hundred sharp cartridge hit whoever's starting shit
Got as many rap soldiers for how much this record ship
Fuck them niggas you record with, I make 'em forfeit
Send a bomb rap through FedEx inside your office
Son we build and deliver, came to build with the GZA
You heard the chorus from the RZA, ain't no real album spitter
Me and my street team be holding congress meetings
Audio visual video treatments internationally speaking
Got managers scared to shop you, ready to drop you
It's the coming of that newest hip-hop, Christ's apostle
Try your BDS and SoundScans for more fam
Your whole roster couldn't take on that one Sun of Man
Get your street team, get your stickers out, put your posters up
Boost your budget up, still Razah gon' fuck it up


You crunchy chump crabs get crumbled up like crack rock
Fuck with the Wu, we busting ya whole snot box
Million white ears and your bitch up in a zip lock
From Spazzola to this purest form of hip-hop


Industrialized niggas change as soon as you get in
Throw 'em on an auction block, CEOs bidding
Highest price paid for those wack rhymes made
Was overrated, cut off, never reinstated
I be fruitful and multiply with marvelous tales
Feed you hungry MCs who be starving as hell
I laid the first verse to quench a dry ass nigga's thirst
Who drank my wisdom up like water till his stomach burst
Full tank with the premium quality raps
Mickey Mouse niggas get caught on a trap
You Cottonelle kid from Tottenville, you're Kleenex
Looking like Rockwell wearing V-necks
You learned from this, earned from this
Niggas get tossed and turned in this and burnt in this
Scorched at a thousand degrees from live MCs
I melt y'all niggas down to the size of fleas


Your microphonists collect the bonus, a-yo we own this
House niggas verse the homeless, ten to one
Timb's the one, Royal Famous. the verbal painters
Dark gallery, million dollar pictures
Imports from poor to riches, move darts
We cruise across the Brooklyn Bridge doing 60
Illegal driving from dusk to red dawn
The GZA/Genius, Wu-Tang, we live long


True indeed, I hug tracks like my seed
Masada, wack MCs do me nada
King Solomon the great came to evaporate the fake
Yeah you, you know you're Power-U
You recognize the voice, it's the nigga from the Wu
Every dart I spit gets mastered and promoted
You've just been demoted cause you're sweet and sugarcoated
You folded, your style is half stale half molded, molded,


You crunchy chump crabs get crumbled up like crack rock
Fuck with the Wu, we busting ya whole snot box
Million white ears and your bitch up in a zip lock
From Spazzola to this purest form of hip-hop




Windshield, rappers are like gnats
They're gettin' splattered 'pon the windshield
Fallin' down like London Bridge, my blade split your onion head
Axe that like Paul Bunyan, Meth prefers the gun instead
Bong bong, put a hole inside your head


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw


How come the streets don't want me to live?
Plus my niggas keep tellin' me fibs
But the devil done poisoned my wiz
I'm doin' this for my family and kids
I'm tryna be wealthy, take my time right and stay healthy
Said it before but I don't think nobody felt me
Yo tried to understand this hand that this life dealt me
I'm on the verge of a whole new makeover
My fake friends, they can take it like a takeover
I'm ready to eat, I'm ready to grip it
Got enemies everywhere, I got chicks that's wicked
Sick shit, niggas doin' wicked ass wig shit
Bid shit, tellin' jakes that I had the biscuit
Niggas be wantin' my leftovers
I'm like a general that died and lost some of his best soldiers
I burn holsters and I kill that dirt religion
Murk that pigeon and I shoot the television


Got that trey pound on you, run down on you
Hard boiled nigga, Clan top soil
My fam straight royal, I'mma die loyal
When them shooters come for you, better throw your flag 'em
I'm pure gun oil, let 'em see that hand cannon
Foundation strong, never ride a bandwagon
Andrew Jacksons, hand-to-hand transaction
Cops jumped out, caught him with his pants saggin'
Criminal individuals up in here
Wild like the theme park ride called The Buccaneer
Weed in the Tupperware, throw you off the upper tiers
Suweeee, I got all my niggas up in here


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw


Imagine the sound of your face scrapin' up against the gate
Of a barbed wire fence, this is barbed iron fist
Heartthrob, iron dick, hoes slob the nob quick
This is odd, so throw it in your iPod quick


Lifeless activity, constant movement
Buyin' elasticity, such improvement
Sword held to where it collapses inward
Spillin' rhymes if it's Shaolin vineyards
RZA had a mixture, then he added sound to the picture
Co-author rewrote the scripture
Math worked from birth, doubled the net worth
Amplified in the time machine of early Earth
A two-way radio, simple yet complex
Receivers, transmitters, interest to contacts
The emergence of the earliest atoms
Transform to a level extremely hard to fathom
Same soup, different bowl, Wu ceramics
Same group on them large-scale dynamics
A wave triggered the burst, glass was shattered
Galactic matter served on a graphic platter


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw


Overachiever, power hungry overeater
I95, whip fly like an overseer
I'm overconfident but some might say I'm overeager
Or overzealous, especially when it's over cheeba
I got a soldier's features, I rock the coldest sneakers
My sneakers' so cold, can't wear 'em 'less you hold the heater
Can't push me over either, that go for dojas
I ain't got no love for posers neither, keep my composure
I'm focused, tryna roll the reefer, let's turn it up
Forget the cope, I'm tryna blow the speaker, that's all he wrote
One verse could turn your soul to ether
It's time you gave me my respects just like the old Aretha
Mr. Meeeth


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw






Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump
Troops on the left, fight to the death
Fam on the right, infrared lights
Wolves in the back, ready to attack, for what
Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump


I pop off like a mobster boss
Angel hair with the lobster sauce
Summertime can't top the scorch
Check my hot broad, I dropped the Porsche
FBI wanna watch the force, trying to lock my source
Where I'm from, hear the macs, techs, Glocks and fours
Hide the safe, nigga, lock the doors
No respect for the cops and laws
In the land where your own blood brother still plot for yours
Seen things that'll drop your jaw
My soldiers got dropped in war, see the mural on the project wall?
Won't stop til I copped them all
Wanna block me? You gots to brawl, trade shots and all
Cuz I ain't on the clock for talk
The Spot Rusher, blow down the spot for sure
Still break off the block with raw, my stock is more
The General, watch your board


Deep pockets with the eight on me, sleep with the safe in the wall
The camo's on with the make-up and all
Swap six 45's, twist reefer in the flicks, papi whoadie ride
Bolt his gun off, from know your horse, she lied
Fly criteria, bury me in Africa
With whips and spears, and rough diamonds out of Syria
A true don, only I could do wrong
Rock fitted hats, get crack money and drive a sick blue joint
Retard-less, I'mma blow regardless
Resume is straight up live, I shank niggas up for larger E's
And speak with the youth in the spot, eat the fresh fruit in the crop
All these hip hoppers eat cock
You could see me in the street or the yacht
I'd rather be promoting your block or buying fresh sneakers with gwops
Yo, I'm an ill dude, always been a real dude
Don't fuck around, I will spill on you and kill you in the field, boo


Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump
Troops on the left, fight to the death
Fam on the right, infrared lights
Wolves in the back, ready to attack, for what
Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump


Leather jackets on, rocked up rock stars
Treacherous bank robbers, the plan go dub, we pop guards
The team gotta eat, seeds is hungry, that's why we ain't scared
To dump on niggas, our guns is chunky
Usually we bust niggas down with bats, swell up they joints
Elbow, wrists, they shins get cracked
We still humiliate, brutalize, Ruger pop, pulverize
Still got gear in the closet, that's stupid live
From Benetton rugby skullies, Oshkosh conductor jumpers
The train hats fit me lovely
Rae job is to make sure the coke is fluffy
While I politic his birthday bash with Puffy
Bagged Nia soon as I linked up, the kid ain't inked up
I'm an old mummy, my gold weigh as much as King Tut (yeah, yeah)
Slippers, robes is minked up, under the doorag, bro (uh, yo, yo)
My three dimensional fade is clean cut


Man, ya'll niggas ain't shit to us, still a pistol bust
Split your melon like I split the Dutch
Got a lot of piff to puff, and I ain't come for fisticuffs
Or for the cop that wanna clip the cuffs
Man, is Staten in this bitch or what?
Don't get it twisted, we, twist it up and even mixed with dust
See these fans can't resist the rush, they Wu-Tang for life
Scarred for life, they can't forget the cuts
Got a whole line of classic joints, and while you at it
Pass the joint, let's push this music past the point
Of no return, til it crash and burn, down the ashes
Then placed inside Ol' Dirty Bastard's urn
When it's my time to go, for sure, ya nigga goes to war
What you think I brought these soldiers for?
To send shot, like forget me not, at any nigga
Respect, bitch, that figure they gon' get me got


Heheh, your basic kung fu's no good
You can't move fast enough!
And you don't have enough strength!
And your body movements are like a street fighter!
It's too easy for me to trip you up!
(Fighting sounds)
Heheh, how's it feel, eh?
Ah, it's no good I feel my back's broken!
Heheh, you've still got a lot to learn!




I love that shit

Wu-tang and graffiti on the wall in Berlin
Clash of the two causes of dangerous whirlwind
Rap flow through a life wire, work for hire
Grip plier put the stronghold on strict attire
Now we multiplied our strength on a worldwide note
Through compact disc televised live quotes
Clear my throat with the green fog from bulldog
Thick smog, my memory kept it on log
Flyin' through space like a comet with DJ Tomekk
Making y'all drunk niggas vomit
Sling it to the Hip hop junkie from country to country
Mic chords is swingin' like monkeys

Yo, Ich rap so optisch, nicht mal Kino kann das
Denn viele Fronters sind auen Hahn und innen Puss' wie Lilo Wanders
Ich hab n' Maul, das sich an Mikros anpasst
Mag meine Schnippen, dicke Titten, groe Augen wie in vielen Mangas
Lass mich gehen auch ohne Riesenanlass
Steh auf die Frauen Sri Lankas auch gerne Tangas, doch am liebsten Blankarsch
Bleib in harten Zeiten ziemlich standhaft
Ihr knnt dissen so viel ihr wollt, doch msst wissen da bin ich fies veranlagt
Chill bei Stieber Twins mit Beatz im Anschlag
Curse ist der Typ der nach'm Bad fragt und mit Edding deine Fliesen anmalt
Deine Tochter in Gesangskabinen langmacht
Auf Grund der sweeten Art noch immer angesagt bei Schwiegermama
Der vieles anfasst was viele anmacht, der viele brandnarbt
Der vielmehr Verstand hat als Kies auf Bank hat
Der fr die Philly Blunt Arzt friedlich ansagt
Das du n' vollkorrekter Chah bist, nee ehrlich, aber dein Stil ist Standard
Und bis die Mucke mir Devisen rankarrt
Steh ich wie Pik 7 bei Burger King fr Pommes auch bei Riesenandrang
Und wenn ein dieser Mann an Mikros ran kann
Geht das Licht aus fr alle anderen MC's, mann
Yo, peace dann

Up in Kreuzberg, Germany, puff a burgundy brown blocks
Kid, we shine from the Apple that rise the battle rock
Mechanical shots, shatter thru a panel of cops
Spread 'em with bates, shell born puncture the face
Chemical gas, we rock from the digital DAT
Material, stereo, universal on wax
Flooded with blacks, I roll with a team with bats
Brooklyn cats, my brothers from the Island of Stat'
Livin Hip-Hop, Wu-Tang Clan, the Sun of Man
We won't stop, the Amsterdam green weed crops
Machinery pops, blood on the scenery, hot
Hip-Hop son, we live for the share in the drop


Yes, yes, yo
Ey, yo mein Flow beim Pissen erdacht, Wissen ist Macht
Was mich an Deutschland ankotzt, wenn jeder Spast aus Rap ne Wissenschaft macht
Hart wenn dein Papst nach nem harten Tag und Herzinfarkt im Straengraben lag aber nicht wieder erwacht
Wahre Feinde dissen dich wenigstens ffentlich
Falsche Freunde ffnen dich und ziehen dich ab
Doch wir planen am Tag, intervenieren bei Nacht
Rasieren deinen schei Arsch, desinfizieren mit Schnaps manchmal
Luft's anders rum wie'n Rasenmher mit Phasendreher
Wenn die zwei Dicken rappen sind auf deinem Jam garantiert die Toiletten leer
Was, ihr wollt mit Stieber Twins zweimal im Doppelbett, platonisch, ohne Sex?
Fr dich ist Hip Hop blo n' Modegag
Bist doch blo am Set weil in dei'm Projekt Kohle steckt
Ich bin der, der Texte schreibt, mein Bruder der der Noten setzt
Und zwischen Heidelberg und Minden geben wir zwei Bodenblech
Zuviel Alkohol im Arsch, klar, schon sitzt man im Idiotentest

I gotcha back, but you best to watch your front
Cause it's the niggas that front, they be pulling stunts
I gotcha back, but you best to watch your front
Cause it's the niggas who front (they be pulling stunts)


I was always taught my do's and don'ts
For do's I did, and for don'ts, I said I won't
I'm from Brooklyn, a place where stars are born
Streets are shot up, apartment buildings are torn
And ripped up, stripped up, shacked up and backed up
From fiends, cause the bosses on the scene, they got it cracked up
Kids are slinging in my lobby
Little Steve and Bobby
Getting paid but it's a life-threatening hobby
Yeah, they still play hide-and-seek
The fiends seek for the crack, and they hide and let the cops peep
Grown folks say they should be out on their own
Before the gangs come and blow up their mom's home
Because they lifestyle is hectic, so fucking hectic
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Bullets are ejected
My lifestyle was so far from well
Could've wrote a book with a title "Age 12 and Going Through Hell"
Then I realized the plan
I'm trapped in a deadly video game, with just one man
So I don't only watch my back, I watch my front
Cause it's the niggas who front, they be pulling stunts
Back on the Ave of Livonia and Bristol with a pistol
Sticking up Pamela and Crystal
You know your town is dangerous when you see the strangest
Kid come home from doing the bid and nothing changes
What is the meaning of CRIME (what?)
Is it Criminals Robbing Innocent Motherfuckers Everytime?
Little shorties take walks to the schoolyard
Trying to solve the puzzles to why is life so hard
Then as soon as they reached the playground, blaow!
Shots ring off and now one of them lay down
It's so hard to escape the gunfire
I wish I could rule it out like an umpire
But it's an everlasting game, and it never cease to exist
Only the players change, so



RZA - I gotcha back (8X)
I gotcha back so you best to watch your front
Cause it's the niggas who front, that be pulling stunts
I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
It's the niggas who front, that be pulling stunts


*old man*
Your, tech, nique, is, mag-ni-ficent
When cut across the neck
A sound like wailing winter winds is heard, they say
I'd always hoped to cut someone like that someday
To hear that sound
But to have it happen to my own neck is... ridiculous
*man gasps for air*




When I request my flashing sword..
And my hand take hold on judgment..
I will take vengeance upon my enemies..
And I will repay those that hazed me..


When you got bass all in your face
Sub woofers pumpin' all throughout the place
A fake rap nigga tryna plead his case
It's about to be, a catastrophe
And if you got beehive's, right before your eyes
About to start shit that'll attract the flies
And then you hear lies, followed by some cries
It's about to be, a catastrophe


Half of these rap lyrics ain't thoughts prevoked
Just alotta beef, til they get caught in smoke
But the problem is never cured, on top of that
Most of them be swingin' wild and then drop the bat
Many curious spectators, watch the human drama
This rap cat was all in the street without his armor
A homicidal attempt, that had failed
He flew off the roof, on the fence, got impaled
He talked a good one, but it was make believe
Much too low, for the human ear to perceive
He confused science fiction with science facts
He couldn't separate the block, from the recorded tracks
Need a rhyme or the tactic, gotta work your magic
Detailed and graphic, but the outcome is tragic
Something built to a complex network
With a panoramic vision, designed by experts
I be the ice breaker, for you unskilled skaters
I increase the heat significantly, just on paper




No matter what, I'm throwin' an iller dart
I can lay a verse, that'll soften a killer's heart
As fire as a five alarm blaze, that's too hot to be holding
You feel the heat, once the flame pumps lace your clothing
What some talk about, had little or no bearing
Could the next be some real shit, that's far from comparing
Materialistic M.C.'s, come off boring
Meanwhile, I be sketching up, deposit drawings
Through the years, a countless, number of victories
Changing the era, we swarm unpredictably
A rhyme book is not, difficult to manage
I leave a mic in a bandage, from catastrophic damage
Rap niggas on a trip, gotta steal your sandwich
So I creeped, division reports was left on canvas
I made it through the worst extremes of cold weather
Scuffed up, but remained durable as old leather
But I hold the pen, you feel the whiff of Polo wind
Something like Jesus, when he civilize older men
The math that shed light, all across the borders
If our wisdom was the vast expands of fresh waters




We call it a sword style, because, we are lyrical assassins
And we aware that the tongue is symbolic to the sword
The lyrical assassins... the lyrical assassins... a sword style...
(The procedure is, check with the knight
Move the knight away to deliver a discovered check from the queen
Then, sacrifice the queen to force the rook next to the king
Then mate with the knight)




I've seen a kid
One night out at the spot
He had a Wu-Tang logo on his face
And just... a tattoo THIS big
And a whole bunch of other shit carved on it
You don't see that often, I mean
I mean I've never seen a, G-Unit logo
On someone's face, or arm, or...
Y'know; not sayin that there isn't
But umm...
I would say it's sort of like a cult following
Y'know but we're just regular people
I mean, I look
I look at myself as a regular person



It was the summer of '77. New York was just recovering from the riots due to the blackout. Hip hop was young and growing rapidly. It was during that time when my father would often make journeys across waters. From Shaolin on his plain to the place where many say this art form started. The ferry, or the boat, as most called it, was a floatin' forum, for talent especially MC's, who would often battle while en route to the city. It was on the boat, where he would sharpen his sword on neighborhood MC's, preparing for the battles that were soon to come...




Here we go, come on


"A battle-A battle was fought, in Brooklyn..."
"Hessian Soldiers killed 3,000 men; much of the fighting took place in what is now Prospect Park in Green-Wood Cemetery as well as the Park Slope and Gowanus neighborhoods."
"This was the first battle of America."


Rugged rhymsters, crooked crimesters
Dime droppers, Twenty-five-to-lifers
Backstabbers, low blowers
Illegal... cocaine growers
Starvation, profanity
Anxiety, brothers trying me
Gun slingers, dead ringers


Yo, my slang's out of this world
Mix collaboration man, little man and his girl
Way of life got me thinking, plus I'm analyzing young
Youths on roofs, you know, three time felony brutes
Roll together, tropical trees puff, whatever
Yo we could go run up on, kids for leathers
What drug? Faculties bubble keys for G's
Cream flow like seven seas, hit chicks Guyanese
Word up, hold your head before you fall out
The morgue route, the devil want that
Let's get my niggas locked all out
Change for better, that be my only vendetta
With life, feed your seed right, he's breathing indeed right
Chef, remarkable, sparkable, raps and tackable gats
Never get jacked, see ya then move black
Paradise trife, plush with much ice
Getting nice, laying back, sleep all my life; word up!


"The battle of Brooklyn depicted was the bloodiest
Clash of the American revolution. Soldiers killed
3,000 men, much of the fighting took place in what is now..."


Crack patients, dime smokers
Vial carriers, mocha tokers
Burnt buildings, brothers building
Save the children, investigative reports!


Calling all cars, calling all cars! Ghetto
Psychos, armed and dangerous, leaving mad scars
On those who are found bound, gagged and shot
When they blast the spot, victims took off like astronauts
Get with this, even your best can't
Come on down, you're the next contestant!
Get your pockets dug from all your Chemical Bank ends
Caught him at the red light  on Putnam Avenue and Franklin
They used to heat up the cipher with a shot that was hyper
Than your average JFK sniper
He just came home from Spofford
Rolling like Kaufman, and laid that ass out like carpet
Stop the stuttering boy, save complaints for the five-oh
Then praise the God  chk-a-chk POW!
They release shots and premeditate to grab
And then they jet back to the lab
And then remain in Shaolin, an endangered island
Where shorties lose blood by the gallons


"Have integrated a number of corrupt cops, judges
...into high-level positions, to insure the continued
Success of the drug smuggling and money laundering operations"


Crack patients, dime smokers
Vial carriers, mocha tokers
Burnt buildings, brothers building
Save the children, investigative reports!


Yo, I grab the pen for revenge and let loose, see
Like Muslims, standing on the block, rocking a kufi
The hundred-dollar kick rocking kid's back for more
Starting gun wars, with black Reeboks and Velours
Jungle way of life, living villain
Packed with visions, copywritten
Throwing bread to pigeons, Christ has risen
King Elegant, slang master, jack expensive noodle hats
In sixty-nine, old timers time that brothers shot craps
The baggy blue Guess jeans, pull strings off in Palm Springs
I'm locked in the bing, Rocky ring labelled rap king
The corner emperor  the golden thieves play the benches
Rednecks be hanging big niggas down in Memphis
Back in Now-Y, hit the bull's eye with loaded nines
Life is like Tarzan, swinging from a thin vine
Shatter dreams, then mirrors don't need a press spirals
Aim at the white shadows with big barrels
Of Moet-ers, the bald headers, milk and Armarettas
Who fear none, crushing all personal vendettas, yo
They use guns while we angrily shot arrows
You better keep your eye on the sparrow


Rugged rhymsters, crooked crimesters
Dime droppers, Twenty-five-to-lifers
Backstabbers, low blowers
Illegal... cocaine growers
Starvation, profanity
Anxiety, brothers trying me
Gun slingers, dead ringers


"Have integrated a number of corrupt cops, judges and lawyers
Into high-level positions  to insure the continued success
Of the drug smuggling and money laundering operations"



* Provides back-up vocals


In my State of the, my State of the Union
Or State... my speech to the... nation
Whatever you wanna call it, my speech to the nation...
(So let me drop it on you, this what I speak, I only speak
To teach what they can't teach)


Aiyo, pardon me Jacob, but let me school these fools
And turn up the heat, melt their cool with jewels
I gave, poems for rules, draped morals and epics
Spoke with dumb, deaf & blind, wise Pagans and kept it
Then watched them fake preachers panic, cuz they food for thought
Got pesticides, but mine is organic
I got to stimulate their brain system
Wrong of the light for great wisdom, hear me?
Health & school systems? Your soul that rock
Cuz of Cuba, it's all free to stay alive
That's why we love Castro and love Yugo
That's why we know so much more shit than you know
Oh Indian land, home of the brave
Where great soldiers bring democracy for the wide blue grave
Oh Indian land, home of the grave
And great culture fast food, and Guantanamo Bay
I saw God's work privatized, I saw graving images idolized
I saw, young girls sodomized, tears dropping down my mama's eyes
But when you stand before God, it's too late to apoligize
And I can go on and on with this
But got to go speak to my people first
Cuz it hurts to see Christians, Athiests, Jews
Treat me better than my own Muslim brothers do
Live professors, ain't even living out the lessons
And I ain't talking bout your Five Percenters
I'm talking bout your faces turn to Heidi Klum, cash and bums
But what about the thirteen ninety ones
Where mighty gun, your brothers fight against with little rocks
Or socialism battling the Bill from Little Rock
Riddles stop with the words I speak; listen
I never teach, I drop words to seek, so get 'em
See got your Google, but stay truthful
I'm in the cut, Chessboxing Noodles
Cutting this struddle, laughing at George


It'll take that, to destroy chaos
Poor people aren't necessarily killers
Are we gonna raise kids, without knowing we have a gun?


The world is filled with chaos and nonsense
Gets no better, with negative responses
The chain of events, creates a global effect
Killing for dollars and cents, to get local respect
The magnitude of the destruction, untold
Countless souls, after the drama, unfolds
Time is a terrible, thing to waste
So the mind must think, at a peaceful pace


Time is a terrible, thing to waste
So the mind must think, at a peaceful pace


I know what I believe
I will continue to articulate what I believe
And what I believe, and I believe what I believe is right




Shit is traveling, hehe, yeah
Uh, and you don't dare stop
Come alive party people give me what you got
Uh, yeah, hidden gun spot


It don't take long to write a song, when the beat is strong
Check the bicep, flex the tricep
When I hold a microphone, you can't take it
When I start to spit the dart, you can't escape it
Trace it, and guide for you to write ya next shit
Supposed to be bitten, and sent three times a day
Fully automatic word spray, hold 'em at bay
Red dragon slay, turn M.C.'s to souffle
M.K. outta B.K., flight outta J.F.K., on his way to the U.K
Heard the fans wanna see me and GZA perform
When Math throw the "Liquid Sword" on, we gettin' on


Check it, darts fly, through the air, hit the M.C
I lay 'em all out, til my clip is empty
No one can take the hate, from the Clan
We execute, carry out the plan
My pen glides across the paper, like skates on ice
Makin' rappers think twice
You don't want to enter this deadly chamber
Even on the same track, you still a stranger
Just the thought, raise the hair on your skin
And once you step in, you feel the forceful winds
Prefuse 73, lace the track, and the DJ
Put many cuts on your back
Even in the foreign land, we still reign supreme
Whether solo, or the entire team
All over the globe, we represent the hip hop
Hoes and forces are bound to get dropped, what?


Wu World Wide, GZA, Masta Killa
Saga continues...




I ain't trying to be no D-boy, I love music, I'm a b-boy
Are you the undercover or the decoy
I'm heavy with the D, Trouble T Roy
A pit with no muzzle about to bust your bubble like a keloid
Too much marijuana got me p-noid
I'm killing instrumentals with that All So Simple Can It Be, boy
Shout to Lil Cease, B.I.G., boy
And Funk Doctor Spock, I mean Redman that's not Leonard Nimoy
88 keys on the keyboard
I'm down to catch wreck, take them first three letters out of record
It's Meth, you heard it through the wire I could be more
Or washed up like Sonny Black's body on the seashore
That's a problem, I could be yours
A monster without the mad scientist and Igor
I've heard it before, a third of these boys
Got murder raps and never even murdered before


Keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
Keeping the streets locked
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
Keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
Run these streets out here don't need cops
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block


Codename Sensei, I live what my pen say
Game hall of fame, flow is MJ, Muy caliente
Je m'appelle Rebel, capisce, comprende?
Son I'm touching 'em up, trust I'm like
Justin Tuck how they ducking the rush
Tryna Break Bad, you catch a bad break
Like I own a bake shop how I stack cakes
Greatness was nothing, Deck the next Nike ad
Wifey bad and my life got 'em slightly mad
Cause I shine like chrome in July
Soldier I opened your eyes, notice the lies
DEA say I'm drugging 'em
I get you leaning hard, I get the fiends to nod, I mean they loving 'em
All hail your highness, terrific win
Put a so-called beast in his place, Pacific Rim


Keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
Keeping the streets locked
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
Keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
Run these streets out here don't need cops
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block


Foul ass police, crooked ass friends
I don't give a fuck yo, the drama never ends
I'm a project nigga, I don't care about the Benz
Plus I had a lot of chicks, you can have those bitches
But I murder your bloodclot if you touch my riches
Yeah crazy ass skipper, I be in the slums, nigga
Fuck where I come from I'm a quiet gangster nigga
First I get you comfortable, then I start shanking niggas
Park Hill code is don't violate the family
Brother to brother it's no snakes in the amnesty
I come through wilding on some Wu-Tang 'Can It Be'
Googly-eyed nigga, chop his face in the ministry
Never scared to do the time, fuck the penitentiary
Leave a bunch of dead niggas, don't forget to mention me
The angel of rap, the un-ordinary light
Already did what I was gonna do before you even got the mic


We left a large solar cloud distinguished by size
Interaction with the wise and civilized
The mind caused matter to fall into a center
A great deal of heat that'll radiate within ya
From out of this collision
The central cord became thick enough to trap its own light and bring vision
Each drop full of Hip Hop energy
Balanced on all sides such great symmetry
The bars unlocked the power of the stars
The mirror in the telescope pinpoint the Gods
From a distance, acting as a guiding coach
Analyze the board, universal approach
Retune the soul to a certain pitch
Changing the frequency frequently, hitting a certain switch
The love is paramount, the connect is brotherly
Respect for the intellect and broad discovery


Keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
Keeping the streets locked
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
Keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
Run these streets out here don't need cops
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block




Don't trust a stranger, my weapons'll bang ya
Don't trust a stranger, my weapons'll bang ya
Don't trust a stranger, my weapons'll bang ya


Yea, anotha Wu Banga, strangler
Y'all better watch for these swords as they swing
Cause you know we ain't playing, son
Worldwide, Japan, check it out..
{*imitating the beat*}

Attack the track like a suicidal bomber
Lyrical assault from experienced rhymer
Niggas sleep, end up dead in a recliner
Witness forget, enforce the Alzheimer
Flying kicks and numbchuck sticks
I speak a verse and break bricks
I throw the first blow
Reach out, steal ya heart on the low
Infectious beats laid down by Nigo
Seven GrandMasters had 5 Deadly Venomz
Metal darts hit the body, then explode in 'em
I swing the gold chain, my whole name is slang
Crack the window pane, shots stain ya brain


Enter the Chamber, watch for the danger
Don't trust a stranger, my weapons'll bang ya


Yo, yo..
In these black streets some pack heat, I stash Shieks
My heartbeat is like stone, steal and concrete
Mental athlete, I smack defeat, crack cheeks
Front and scream in peace, we leave ya whole click deceased
In break bread with Shinobi, Isreal the Golden Shield
Shaleek, Jah Shameek, I conversate with Iron Shiek
King Masada, they never ever win, the Godfather
Worldly author, visual rapper, the Pearl Harbor
Superficial lava, I burnt the City of Gomorrah
Through a life of horror, I spoke the tongue of a lawyer
My holy aura generates the blood of the Tora
And if you out of order you can't escape from my slaughter
I turn steam into water, ask ya crew about the shot-caller
Legendary, human brawler, brawler, brawler..




You know what I see? Potential..
Check, check, check, check it, check..
Check, check, check..

I see guerillas in the mist
With bathing apes, within an eclipse
Carriers of hip-hop tapes, ripping in a milk-crate
Athletic MC's, do tracks around the lap, still sting like the Bees
While the gates'll rip the tea-house up in the tree-house
You walk around the trap, bisect like a free mouse
My Wu-Tang logo on the back of a kimono
Beat played in the background, on the phono
My Kung Fu, be the tough Wu
Look for the dragons when they come through
On the manual, the title's in Boston caligraphy
I swing the sword, heads rolling respectively




Enter the Chamber, Enter the Chamber
Enter the Chamber, Chamber
Enter the Chamber
Enter the Chamber
Walk these dogs, moving with Allah




Ain't nothing changed, RZARectah
Yo Gleamz, throw it up
Yo, 12, you see him over there? (bododododo)
Shitty, Merdoc, you take the front
Zoo Keeper, you come wit me, let's go


Knock knock, guess who came knockin' at your door
It's them Brooklyn Zu dudes and we back for more
Knock knock, we from the slum where poppers are from
Get your facts right, game tight, ain't playing tonight
Knock knock, this ain't right, cuz change light that bring light
Same night, watch the story tonight
Knock knock, if you didn't wanna play wit these cats
You should of shut ya ass up, now it's lay where you at
So knock knock


Dartsman, marksman, captain of the starship, you can mark this
The night that you reached your darkening
Zu blade master from the Dirt Dog Chapter
Get snapshot, exit wound back and G cut after
Lay my life on the line for any Cuffie Crime nigga
Stand trial, lay 'em down, blame cats uptown now
My dig, came to Dirt, nigga, so this off hurt critters
Got ghost getter, under Roc-A-Fella in winter
Peep me in the Maybach, 12 boomin' on haze back
Gleamz, you got made gat, take aim, refrain at
It's the payback, Shitty hit 'em wit the mack
Merdoc gon' wild, Zoo Keeper got watch
Damn right we do it, how we gotta
After that, post up and bury chicks
Sippin' on a new trick, the casualty's reality
The gun game, the slug name, end game
Ya life nothing but memories and shames




For those who thought it would of been a drought forever
Flood the city wit plenty rain and call wicked weather
The scale of the event was unprecedent
MC's reactions, delayed and hesitant
Swords are bent, the gravity gon' mad
Heavy rhymes they move through the galaxy on pads
While traveling, they test air and change seasons
Collide with exploding stars and rap breathings
The dominant factor within the universe
Highest form of light that live off the grains of Earth
Never go against it, because it's not the objective
Plus there's no room for error on the different descriptive
Yo, I still write the raw uncut material
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
Words are like bullets, verses are like clips
Rhymes are just guns, cannons that sink ships




Dope man, dope man, I got the snub in my right hand
Traffic coke in the Mazda van
My whole team Supreme Clientele like Ironman
28, turn a range in his tan, man
When I drive with my seeds, there's no contraband
Like shooting revolvers, it's auto jam
Got the baseball bat, head's a ball, man
MOney tall, and nigga, this is midget man
Cut up coke, I'm Edward the Scissorhands
Niggas is pussy, all I see is panties, man
Carry tools on my belt, like a handy man
Smoke O.G. kush with Method Man






I'm the obscene slang kicker with no parental sticker
Advisin' y'all that wise words is much slicker
Under circumstances label advances
Ample opportunity, infinite chances
To rhyme, so unrelated beef I don't stress
I seen many killed for infinitely less
Ya raps be the clips that's packed with lies
Cowardlessly ya shoot up those innocent bys
In extra long verses hundred bars in length
The percentage of the truth in the rhyme is one tenth
A solid mass of minerals, easily broke down
Hard rock MC's ya nothin but compound
Sparked by the endless greed of CEO's
In the videos, with those questionable flows
Take it twenty-six, cut it down to four bars, make it a hook
If it's not on the song it's in a book


Knock Knock
Who the fuck is bangin at my door?
Is it abstract commercial or hardcore?
Better know who the fuck they lookin for
Cuz they don't want more
Yo Knock Knock
Who the fuck is bangin at my door?
Is it abstract commercial or hardcore?
Better know who the fuck they lookin for
They don't want more


The CREAM of the crop we run circles that remain symmetrical
With lightnin victories that's highly electrical
My microphone is just too hot to handle
Plus I don't fill ya ears with the, Pennister's scandal
I gift wrap the sawed-off, the DeeJay pump it
March to the sounds of Armstrong's trumpet
Great things satisfy great minds
You want me to paint scenes describe it in eight lines
Check it
Conceptional breakthrough, incomprehensible
Rap that make you, convinced it's invincible
Lease up my words, powerful hazardous
The most dedicated research the data; this
Info tempo, is gatherin momentum
A thousand rounds of ammo wondering who spent them
Applied science to, vocals we flyin through
Victorious always because I am who?




I wrote this rhyme with a Sharpie
You see this dark key ignition's for those with keys
Who wanna start me up
That's where nature and nightmare converge
Where you hold in so much inside, ya gotta splurge
On these snakes with the fangs that, poke through your denim
When ya move it accelerates the action of the venom
But the purity and sacrifice gettin stung twice
From those who load dice, the target is G-Grice
Cuz rhyme travelers are light years beyond
The Clan had a bomb that made the world respond
Considering my own future, I'm used ta
Damaging MC's then party-ing with producers
Whose main makin cereal from two tracks of stereo
Hold That song's playin weak ass material
We all peak at a singular point in time
'Till you see the sign, nigga resign






Bitches running up and flashing like a photo sb's on while I'm sipping on that slo-mo

I be the Unholiest the oracle ,She wanna chill with me
Cause my aura cool ,G star jeans kind of sort of dude

In these rhymes I write my life like a thesis
When I was 12 I went to hell for snuffing Jesus
Fuck that man the masses gon believe this
I'm unstoppable the abominable for reasons
Ain't nobody keeping no tabs on me, I got some tabs on me
Fuck with me baby meet the unholy army
We jus tryna party
But pardon me,im probably
John Locke on adderal , arguably
Somewhere in the astrals, mob with me
Ya third eye calcified , so its hard to see
My Aura poppin' like a zanny
I'm out of site, before ya bitch could even find her panties
The blunt ignites, the only hairy bitch I like is Mary
Sincerely,got bigger things to stress over than superstition
Assassinate the secret service ,when I tote the smithin
Rip up the
Declaration ,Overthrow the system
Deep meditation ,nigga my soul is missin'
The goal is to get top from whoever you kissin'
Trust me I'm a fucking cloud stomper
Master of the mantra
Fuck a gun nigga better open up ya chakra
Even tho you heathens prolly won't even bother
I'm the godfather
Of
Everything mystical
Put unholy homies where ever the abyss would go
Twisting up ya mind, And Fuckin up ya physical
Prolly why ya ho down to roll like a tissue though
She claim that you so got damn predictable

Call me young actavis or astral
Don't believe in yolo cause I been here In the past ho
I'm pretty sure in every single life I am an asshole
But this might be my first speech to the mass yo
Thinking without no barriers
Fuck god cuz when I call he ain't hearin us
Fuck satan too he da one dat put the fear in ya
But ain't no such thang
Just the yin and the yang
Negatives and positives keep the world fuckin sane
You couldn't even fathom, My synapses reactions
That's why I'm Rolling wit the unholy faction
These vibrations you wouldn't understand it
Vivid ass lyrics everything I say is candid
While niggas in the hood let it blast like a cannon
Im an avid substance abuser , Thee unholy recruiter
You into higher counciousness than I'm ya fuckin tutor
Tryna spread a message no intentions of malice
Kick knowledge to ya dome till ya ears get caliced
Fuck whatever you rock we still anti-stylist

Wish that I could put my lucid dreams on replay
If life's a bitch, tell me why the fuck she so easy
The world spin around like a record ... Who the d-j?




Lot of people, you know what I'm saying
That be getting misinformed, thinking everything is everything
You could just get yourself a little deal, whatever
You know what I'm saying
You gonna get on, you gonna get rich
And all these labels be trying to lure us in like spiders
Into the web, you know what I'm saying
So sometimes people gotta come out and speak up
And let people understand
That you know you gotta read the label
You gotta read the label
If you don't read the Label you might get poisoned


Bomb these niggas God!


Tommy ain't my motherfuckin' boy
When you fake moves on a nigga you employ
We'll all emerge off your set, now you know God damn
I show living large niggas how to flip a def jam
And rough up the motherfuckin' house cause I smother
You cold chillin' motherfuckers, I still warn a brother
I'm ruthless my clan don't have to act wild
That shit is jive, an old sleeping bag profile
The soft comedian rap shit ain't the rough witty
On the reel to reel it wasn't from a tough city
Niggas be game, thinking that they lyrical surgeons
They know they microphone's a virgin
And if you ain't boned a mic you couldn't hurt a bee
That's like going to Venus driving a mercury
The capitol of this rugged slang is Wu-Tang
Witty unpredictable talent and natural game
I death row an mc with mic cables
The epic is that I rush associated labels
From east west to atco, I bring it to a next plateau
But I keep it phat though, yo
I'm hitting batters up with the wild pitch style
I even show an Uptown MC a style
Who thought he saw me on 4th & Broadway
But I was out on the island, bombing MC's all day
My priority is that I'm first priority
I bone the secret out a bitch in a sorority
So look out for A&M, the Abbot and the Master
Breaking down your pendulum
As I fiend MC's out with a blow that'll numb the a-
-ppendix, I'm holding more more weight than Colombia
Index Interscope, we RCA, clan
That's coming with a plan to free a
Slave of a mental death MC don't panic
Throw that A&R nigga off the boat in the Atlantic
Now who's the bad boy character, not from Arista
But firing weapons released on Geffen
So duck as I struck with the soul of Motown
My central broadcasting systems is low down
And dirty, like that bastard
It's getting drastic


Read the label and say it loud
Another Wu banger
Thirty-six chambers, through your area
(Yeah, the RZA, phat tracks on a disc)
RZA razor RZA razor sharp
(Another Wu-Tang production kid, coming at ya)




Who won the covenant role, based on a nationwide poll?
For the grip tales told and rap scrolls
Perfect pitch for language that's built within
Where half the rap ink couldn't hold my pen
Meanin' when emcees came, to live out the name
They signed the documents with the, blood of the slain
Far removed from this hip hop life off course
But the confidence and resilience was never lost
In the think tank and research labs I laid tracks
Seen work rule my life but it never broke my back
Destiny forever shake from the events to come
From the father and the chemical contents of the sun
A solid gold figure with a verse that glitters
Until the platinum beat comes increasingly bitter
They joined in a likely alliance with the rest
Schemin' with unsuccessful in a zealous Quest
We all see, with a degree of certainty
Who the fake, cowardly cats behind the curtains be
(Yeah, yeah...)
They hunt, for the skin, flesh, the blood, and bones
In front, want to impress with studdes stones


Now who's the man who brought you the Legend
Of the Liquid Sword?
Rap critics say "Damn, you're sick with your's"
4th Chamber and the Shadowboxin' too
That Nigga be the GZA from Wu
And if you don't know
About the pyroclastic flow
Hotter than the spark that made it blow
You better recognize, recognize....


My U-N-I-verse run like clockworks forever
Words pulled together, sudden change in the weather
The nature and the scale of events don't make sense
A storm with no warnin', you're drawn in by immense
Gravity that's gone mad, clouds of dust and debris
Moving at colossal speeds, they crush an emcee
Since this rap region is heavily packed with stars
Internal mirror in the telescope, noticed the Czar
From far away, they blink as the lightnin' strolled
Great distance of space between precise globes
That travel in a circle of order
Like the tape in your cassette recorder filled with cult for slaughter
(Yeah, yeah...)
Meaning the con-tracts manifestly work
The hitman for hire, weapon in his hand he lurks
Inspite of the strange appearance he laid a clearance
On his target through a crowded market
No interference
The microphone left on the scene without a serial
Evidence consistent with organic material (Well)
Surprisingly, as we marched lively with great size and degree
'Til it spread widely





 + (Raekwon)
(Yeah, yeah) Aiyo, how much more for a fifth of Vodka? (Peace beloved)
(Six bottles of Henny, six bottles of Henn) Word, word, let me get that
Herb, yeah, yeah.. (bring that bucket here)
Yeah (get some ice, man, two more bottles of Cru', man, word up)


I've gone through life pretending
That time will change the ending


Peace to the God (peace God) pour out a little liquor
Shame On A Nigga, I heard the reaper done came to get ya
So I done copped a fifth of, Vodka, and in your honor
I've grown this fetish for loose ladies and baby mommas
Some say it's bad karma, what you do, man, it come back on ya
Music got us up off them crack corners
Now I'mma swallow this whole bottle for Ol' Dirty
Damn, it hurts me, I hate it when brothers go early




Word to my son, he gon' remember you, rubbing on a statue
In his lab, that resemble you, and what it meant to Wu
Us forming like a family, you just blew
You was the chess piece on the board, that made us look true
Watching your pen swish, you love frying kingfish
You the pearl in the ocean, I'm up on the land, pissed
Now you moving more prestigious, me, hitting this reefer
I know it's real, guess I slept with the Black Jesus




I became weak when I heard, that his body expired
It was hard for me to believe my brother retired
Suddenly the clock stopped and the room started spinning
How can he walk off the field during the first inning?
I cried like a baby on the way to his place of death
Hate not being there, the minutes before he left
Now I'm in the booth, ten feet from where he lay dead
I think about him on this song and what he might've said




When I first heard the word, I needed air to clear my head
I know you didn't say what I thought you said, my brother's dead
You crazy, another Dirty prank to get the family cranked
Ya'll niggas shouldn't play like that, I know how you feel
Lord, but it's real, and I still can't believe
And my heart still grieves the loss, there's no pretending
Ason Unique, loved wine and fine women
We singing on tour, "ooh baby, we like it raw"




Can't pretend...
Some day it gotta come to an end
But I'mma keep you right here dog, real close to my heart
Yeah...


I popped a bottle on your born day, God
Tried hard not to cry, I still can't hide the scar
And I still ask, why to God, analyzing your form
As I stood there beside your mom
And I share the blame, cuz you was calling for help, kid
Should've, would've, could've, had the time, I was selfish
I carry on your struggle, each day it really hurts me
I really miss you Russell, hope you forgive me Dirty




Yo, these walls I wanna crash, and put my fists through
Shout out to Dirty, let the whole world miss you
Reach out and kiss you in your coffin, my heart races
I dropped tears and watch my nigga fall from greatness
It's all wasted, flushed down the drain and
Soon as the news hit me, I bust out with pain and
Rivers I cried, my brother just died
I'mma see you, my nigga, on the other side




Ah, man, how do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones that have to die
It's hard to live without you, God, I shouldn't have doubted you
When you said that The Passion of Christ was all about you
From the God Mobile, to Linden Plaza, to Brownsville
Florida to Ohio, to Putnam, to Park Hill
You interrupt the Grammy's said "Wu for the kids"
Took four or five shots when they rushed in the crib
Trey-five-seven cracked ya ribs, cops shot ya whip
You've been chased by the pigs, sold the four year bid
Crashed cars, still came out without a scar
They tried to keep ya free spirit trapped in a jar
So you'll keep ya mouth shut, and not tell the world
Who's who and what's what, and probably go nuts
How we treat them hoes? Dirt, how we treat them hoes?
We fuck 'em in the butt, Dirt




But those mistakes behind me
Cast shadows to remind me

*gong bangs*
*Sifu Shi Yin Ming reciting the Heart Sutra*




I got scientist killas that'll jam your cell phone
Send a text message, kill you off with a ringtone
High pitched noise, on your brain, it's heavy
Autopsy report, that he jumped off a train
It started when the dearly departed, tried to escape max'
Then cut into the general's income like state tax
One call, to seal the deal with feel
Doctor on the payroll, cost a quarter mill


The mailman's late with the check
I'm in the flood with a bunch of bills that's about up to my neck
Plus my rent's not paid and the light's about to go off
Car got stolen by a thief who likes to show off
I can't even get a job, giving out flyers
I'm a handyman with a pair of broke pliers
The fridge is bare as Mother Hubbard's cupboard
I'm so down and out, I can only go upward


I form rhymes in alphabet soups
From the rhythm of the spoon, I transform the loop
From the steam of the bowl, I'm making special effects
Add a dash of spice, only God can detect
Had a word, to make a bear return to his cub
A word that make a girl come home from the club
A word that make a demon return back to God
And the word that help Dorothy get home from Oz
Thirty frames per second, these films we be perfecting
Scenes of light put through all projection
Electricity, perfectivity
Audio and visually, physically and mentally


I got a smile that'll make the mirror crack
And I seem to stay under clouds that's pitch black
So when it rains, it pours, and when it pours, I'm soaked
I contracted lung cancer from third-hand smoke
And uh, I'm like the frog that's dying to be a prince
The boy who cried wolf and no one was convinced
The man who hit lotto and lost his ticket
In a rainstorm, and struck by lightning trying to get it


And sometimes I feel like my life's a movie
I don't like to film, I don't like to film
And sometimes I feel like my life's a movie
I don't like to film, I don't like to film
Play it all back, play it all back


Lights, camera, action, let the tape roll
Some scripts get ripped, canned or even sold
Directors vision, producers decision
And raised the budget, because the chase had collisions
Stunt double risks his life just for the thrill
DP checks the gate before the scene gets sealed
Gaffer slapped with a slate for being late
Craft service got nervous and dropped a hundred plates
Leading actor banging an extra in the trailer
Screaming, hitting high notes like Mahalia
Box office hit and a Blockbuster smash
Two hundred mil' budget and still recouped the cash





There's a rumor that an old lady heard a
Kingpin hiring a hitman to murder
A federal prosecuting drug-dealing witness
But that's how it is in the business
And I'm in it, physically gaining power
Constantly counting up cash by the hour
And it feels good to be paid
Regardless of how many victims get slayed
Accomplices of mine drop like flies
But in this everyday a homeboy dies
Whether shot in the body or cyanide in ya Bacardi
Cause it's a cutthroat party
Now it's up to me to retaliate
And if I score, I'll increase the murder rate
I move on ones who double-cross
Set them up, now they suffer the loss
Of he or she who's ever on the agenda
Most likely a family member
Informants, rattle-tattle-telling snakes
Get shot up, brutalized and thrown in lakes
The parts of a body is found days later
The other half was done by an amputator
I'm undefeated in plenty fights
My enemies are beaten with many stripes
I'll shoot up funerals, firebomb wakes
Vehicular homicides, whatever it takes
Just to keep control of my empire
I'll set ya own mother on fire
Cause when it comes down just to me and my money
Ain't a fucking thing funny
All those who pose a threat I'll stick them
Ya friends, ya family and innocent victims
Get caught in the midst when I'm busting of nines
But they was in the wrong place, the wrong time
Decapitated bodies found in lots
While I'm still cooking up kilos in pots
The kilos becomes bricks and the bricks becomes rocks
Then retailed on the blocks
I drive around in expensive cars
And get women who fuck like porno stars
I get them high, you know, like powder they nose
Then put 'em in the streets as my high-class hoes
I'm wild, living foul and I'm ruthless
I leave muthafuckers toothless
I had a worker who stepped on the scene lively
Then started selling my customers Ivory
Soap, counterfeit vials of cracks
I stuck 'em to death with a thousand thumbtacks
You've seen my resume, that's just the half
I'm a bad muthafucker, just like Shaft
A character played by who? Richard Roundtree
The only difference, my guns are sound-free
Silencers ring off then wisp by
Then all you hear is a last minute cry
Of those who triedto control my territory
Not the West Side but the Bed-Stuy story
Police be giving me eye-to-eye contact
But I smile cause I'm putting out contracts
Now a G-note is placed upon ya head
You say picture that alright, bang ya dead

This is the life of a drug dealer




When I was little, my father was famous
He was the greatest samurai in the empire
And he was the Shogun's decapitator
He cut off the heads of a hundred and thirty-one lords
It was a bad time for the empire
The Shogun just stayed inside his castle and he never came out
People said his brain was infected by devils
My father would come home, he would forget about the killings
He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him
Maybe that was the problem
Then, one night, the Shogun sent his ninja spies to our house
They were supposed to kill my father but they didn't
That was the night everything changed...


See, sometimes
You gotta flash em back
See niggas don't know where this shit started
Y'all know where it came from
I'm saying we gonna take y'all back to the source
Do the knowledge... yo!


When the MCs came to live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before he rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Yo RZA flip the track with the what to cut...


Fake niggas get flipped
In mic fights I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe
On some wild out shit, to insert a fiend
But it was your op to shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rolling smart
I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirt
That's minimum, and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance that's if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my Clan in the front want it




I'm on a mission that niggas say is impossible
But when I swing my swords they all choppable
I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
Child educator, plus head amputator
Cause niggas styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers
Lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers
Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
Round the clock, that state pen time check it
But the pens I be sticking with, you can't state the crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels
Niggas are fascinated how the shit begin
Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin









Dilogo Shogun



Ves, a veces
Tienes que recordarles
La gente no sabe donde empez esta mierda
Vosotros sabis de donde viene
Estoy diciendo que os vamos a hacer volver al origen
Haz la sabidura!



Cuando llegaron los MCs a vivir el nombre y actuar
Algunos tuvieron que esnifar cocaina para actuar como locos antes de que "Pete Rock-ed it on"
Ahora con el plano mental para desencadenar el cerebro con el edificio para ser nacido
Yo RZA pon el track a tope con el que para cortar



Los falsos niggas son volteados
En peleas de micros balanceo espadas y corto payasos
Mi mierda es demasiado veloz para morderla que tendrs que grabarla y escribirla
Fluyo como la sangre en la escena del asesinato, como una jeringa
En alguna mierda salvaje, para insertar un demonio
Pero era tu op(operacin) comprar arte robado
Pillar un corazn inchado por no actuar inteligente
Pongo increble presin, en psimas rimas falsas que son heridas
La mierda es interpretada como los signos del zodiaco en suteres
Eso es mnimo, y femenino como las sandalias
Mi mnima pila en la mesa es un verso en la apuesta
La energa es sentida una vez repartidas las cartas
Con el impacto de patadas giratorias de cinturones negros
Que atacan, a los micrfonos como ciclones o tifones
Represento de medianoche a medioda
No gasto tinta, nigga yo pienso
Suelto bombas megatn(o toneladas) ms rpido de lo que parpadeas
Porque los pensamientos de rimas viajan a una velocidad tremenda
Nubes de humo, de combinaciones naturales de hierba
Solo bajo una circunstancia, si estoy fumado
Pon esa mierda, mi clan en el frente lo quiere

Estribillo



Estoy en una misin que dicen que es imposible
Pero cuando balanceo mis espadas todos son troceables
Soy el "suelta cadveres", el parador de corazones
Educador de nios, adems de amputador de cabezas
Porque sus estilos son viejos como las deportivas Mark 5
Las letras son dbiles como los altavoces de un radio-despertador
Ni siquiera paran en mi estacin y atacan
Mientras tu plan fall, descarrila como Amtrak
Para que cojones? Bajo el peso de la ley, hago normas
Soy la justicia, y sentencio ese culo dos a cuatro
Alrededor del reloj, que declara el timepo de crcel (check it)
Pero los bolis con los que clavo/critico, no puedes declarar el crimen
Vine con el Wu, me escabull al DL
Soy de notas bajas como las conchas marinas, sacudo estas campanas
Ahora ven a bordo, va con rumbo a Medina
Entra a la sala, y hay un sonido totalmente diferente
Hay una ancha entrada, pequea salida como un embudo
Tan profundo que se pilla en las radios en tneles
Niggas estn fascinados por cmo empez la mierda
Vacnate, mi logo est marcado en tu piel





Such a shame, such a shame
Critical...

You're living foul, things are getting wild
It's difficult to raise a child
Cause growin up in a lost environment
Every day becomes a new experiment
Now we are faced with problems
But if we come together we can solve them
Before we start to solving, here's a sample
Who's coming foward to set the example
Inflation, starvation
Surviving takes a strong nation
Those who like to bring about static
Be aware of the true Asiatic
What you see was predicted before
We were already warned of this bloody drug war
Wherever you sell it wherever you go
Ya still being clocked by the cops, ya know
You're paid by the hours, they see time flies
While your brain's being showered by a bunch of lies
You say I'm no slave where's the lock and chain
Hmmm, on your ignorant brain
Skip to ya loo with your High Pro Glow
Ya not stim off life, ya stimulated off blow
Or the new improved, ask beaming Jack
Criza, criza, crack

Chorus: You're living foul, living foul

My people you were forced then brought
Stripped from your jewels brainwashed and then taught
To hate, deceive and dislike each other
Separating themselves, you're not my brother
Sit up at home for a mystery
Face-valuing things that you can't see
Can't taste can't smell, hear or feel
But senses prove everything is real
I'm here to present a positive way
If strong you'll accord if weak you'll stray
Drug users are stuck in the mud
Another 20th century modern day chud
These cannibal humanoid undernourished dwellers
Just took your check to the heroin cellar
Dope addicts, that walk and roam
Might have Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
AIDS, doesn't come from me
Cause I've studied and learned my history
It had to be something evil to bring that about
This is showing and proving beyond a shadow of a doubt

Chorus: You're living foul, living foul

When you wake up, to a brand new day
And you think about your salary or your pay
You think of negative things, should I get involved
Caught in crime, serving time, that's problems to solve
So you think about it, say that you must quit
Smoke a blunt, then you do the same old shhhh
And while ya high you don't truly know why
You spent your cash so that you can buy
Some herb (word) and some Old E (yeah)
A fifty cent Philly so the herb can be
Rolled up modern style to what we call a blunt
Know the facts is true don't try to front
Or stray away from the positive message in the song
That's only showing and proving you're not strong
And the strong is what we need today
Why? They go the opposite way

Chorus: Of living foul, you're living foul

The words right now flowing off my tongue
Is for the old, the young, the one's that's strong
Those who are worshippers of diamonds and gold
You should not be bought and you should not be sold
Those who always want but does not need
Is slightly controlled by the hands of greed
If you rob, steal, backstab and abduct
Sooner or later you will self-destruct

Chorus: You're living foul




Yo (yeah), check it out, son, check it out, son
Yo (Wu, can I get a soo?), live in the place to be
You got the capital G, Z to the A, MC
Givin' a mad shout out to the Ranch Crew, from the old school
And we gonna take y'all back, know what I'm sayin'?
Lyrical sorcerors right here, the fathers, the cream of the crop, son
(Yo, check it)


Well, if you livin' in the world today
You be hearin' the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front, we don't have 'em
So we blast 'em, alright, well, ok
Well, if you like the way it sounds, then clap, man
And if the women love it too, well, then raise your hands
But only raise your hands if you're sure
Punk niggas shatter like a glass jaw, break it


My rhyme gross weight vehicle combination
Was too heavy for the Chevy's, is chased out the station
Double-edged was the guillotine that beheaded it
Gassed up, fuckin' with some regular unleaded shit
Heads roll on hillsides behind ropes that
Bind-in, X marks the spot on the scope
Heavily armed, military is necessary, it's a gamble
MCs bet they best at every
Powerful parable ditties might harm
If tampered with, set off and strike like pipe bombs
Flashbacks to the "Duel of the Iron Mic"
Look out for these fatal flying spikes, of massive
Sleep-holds, put strangle on commercial angle
Microphone cords tangled from being Star Spangled
Now, who could ever say they heard of this?
My motherfuckin' style is mad murderous


Well, if you like the way it sound then clap man
And if the women love it too well then raise your hands
But only raise your hands if you're sure
Punk niggas shatter like a glass jaw, break it

Well, if you livin' in the world today
You be hearin' the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front we don't handle 'em
So we blast 'em, alright, well okay



Well, what you know about MCin'?
Yo, I know a lot
Well, can you demonstrate somethin', nigga?
Huh, I'd rather not
I'm talkin 'bout stacks, cousin
Nigga, that's what I got
Cash Rules the world
Well, Cash Rules the spot


My preliminary attack keep cemeteries packed
Of niggas who think it ain't like that
MCs are gunned down like being run down with mad trucks
Then, God struck, religious niggas call it "bad luck"
Rap celeb, you got caught up in the web
Now, bees are stingin', yo, that niggas em-singin'
I'm just swingin' swords strictly based on keyboards
Unbalanced like elephants and ants on see-saws
I throw raps that attack like the Japs on Pearl Harbor
MCs be out like bank robbers
Fleeing the scene, to be a sole survivor
DJ, the getaway driver
Tried to dip, but he dive, I socialize on vocal vibes
On tracks stabbed up with razor-sharp knives
Criminal subliminal minded rappers find it
Hard to define it, when narrow is the gate
For fat tapes and, then, played out and out of date
Then I construct my thoughts on site to renovate
And from that point, the God made a statement
Draftin' tracements, replacements in basements
Materials in sheet-rock, to sound proof the beatbox
And microscopic optics received through the boxes
Obnoxious topic, major labels, flavor tropical
Punchlines, that's unstoppable
Ring like shots from Glocks that attract cops
Around the clubs and try to shut down the hip-hop
But we only increase if everything is peace
Father You See King the police


Well, if you livin' in the world today
You be hearin' the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front, we don't have 'em
So we blast 'em, alright, well, ok
Well, if you like the way it sounds, then clap, man
And if the women love it too, well, then raise your hands
But only raise your hands if you're sure
Punk niggas shatter like a glass jaw, break it

Well, if you livin' in the world today
You be hearin' the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front, we don't have 'em
So we blast 'em, alright, well, ok

The Wu-Tang say
We don't handle 'em, alright, well okay
The world today, the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front we don't handle 'em
So we blast 'em, alright, well okay




This is a tale of a town with the population
Of approximately two thousand people
A small close knit community where crime
And murder were virtually unheard of
Where front doors were always left unlocked
A place where mayhem only happens in your wildest dreams


For some, the sun will never come out tomorrow
Like those in this heart pounding tale of random horror
Of a body count, after trashin' it, they done with it
Victims inflicted with passionate punishment
Specific offers of horrific torture
That left crime scenes, that retired law enforcers
His ruthlessness knew no bounds, as he beat him down
Shot him while gagged and bound, kept the whole town
Shocked, with they doors locked, fire arms cocked
Major roads blocked, no one knows when he knocks
As a kid he killed three pets of an attorney
So his childhood passion became a life long journey
Grew into a world of destruction, abduction
Left many body parts flowin' on the Hudson
Whether fountain or ditch, after the ride you hitched
Screams was high pitched from scars you can't stitch
Mutilated and decapitated, white collar chicks
Just from his involvement in local politics
His outfit stained with the blood of the slain
While his backyard full of skeletal remains
His goal in life, was preparation for death
An autopsy showed asphyxiation, loss of breath
Was it his fascination, for strangulation
The lynchings in the '20's was his inspiration
Unspeakable acts that made front page
Motivated by an unexplainable rage


"A suspected killer plaguing this community
Has once again eluded police and detectives"
"We have no leads, no photos, no suspects"
"This nameless, faceless murderer
Has killed a couple, execution style, in their own home
Smashed a 12-year old Little League ball player skull, with a baseball bat"
"We have no leads, no photos, no suspects"


The State psychologist, forensic pathologist
Warned the detective to search beyond the obvious
They ruled out the possibility that the killa be
Physically fit with athletic ability
Talley and murder, on his agenda
There was no word, and it's code for "surrender"
So when the headlines had announced the arrest, the repercussion
Was his trial became a lightning rod for discussion
Compellin' evidence, statements from residents
Validated guilt as he maintained his innocence
From the hair to the fiber, broke the bondage wire
The stains on the carpet consisted with saliva
DNA directly linked to the psycho
Luminal made it glow, was test to Type 0
For many years, a lot of murders went unsolved
A lot of blood resolve as guns still revolve
The bullets had names that made the frames shatter
Most savage massacre that made the brains scatter
Detectives astounded by the scope of the crime
Made a hard discovery from one of many signs
While questionin' a man he picked up on a scanner
He reacted in a loud and agitated matter
And once they tried to read him his rights
He turned cold as ice




Uh, Dreddy Kruger, what up, my nigga?
Yeah, GZA, you know, uh, Rassy, you know
Shouts out to my nigga Wreckonize, all my MIA


Formed in very a strong advanced post, east to west coast
Ahead of time, competition not even half close
Let's say, by no means, an equal value
Prematurely brought to play, I'll never allow you
To strike first, so precautions must be taken
And what's worst? When you're just fronting and faking
It's a shame when the sixteen bars are just a waste
And every line or word, is badly placed
Even dealing with the narrow window of time
My arrangements, are quick, shutting down your power lines
On a bunch of small puppets, with a wack ass team
That only move, at a push of a button that pull strings
Bad boys move in silence, secretly fading in
Unlike fake gangstas and ya wannabe made men
Acting like they carry the gun that killed Lincoln
Or they rolling with two hundred murderers from Kingston


Our goal is to learn y'all niggas, about this new world order
But I'm still try'nna run up in the president's daughters
He the author, ain't let the NARC's see this sparker
Stick to bitches walls like I'm Peter Parker
The Vida Guerra sidekick hacker
Five naked pics, on the Internet jacked her
Dog, I'm not a rapper, I'm the black Dracula
Nosferatu, spitting darts at you, out of black Acura
Homies is gat packers, rat packer
Fly nigga, I'm the Benjamin stack attractor
Mack attacker, pimp slapper, the track cracker
Epitome of nice, after Rainbo press the lacquer
And y'all niggas is the worst, like fat chicks with little tits
If your names not YKK, then get off my dick
Bitch, I hang with the trillest, and that's why 5 percenters
College kids and ex-felons feel us
I'm sick with the words, Waterproof and Liquid Swords
The world never heard this before, call me Mr. More
More money, more murder, and more spit to serve




 Yeahhh, torture, motherfucker, what?

What? I'll fuckin'  I'll fuckin' tie you to a fuckin' bedpost with your ass cheeks spread out and shit, right? Put a hanger on a fuckin' stove and let that shit sit there for like a half hour, take it off and stick it in your ass slow like *Tsssssss*
 Yeah, I'll fuckin'  yeah, I'll fuckin' lay your nuts on a fuckin' dresser, just your nuts layin' on a fuckin' dresser, and bang them shits with a spiked fuckin' bat
 Whassup? BLAOWW!!
 I'll fuckin'  I'll fuckin' pull your fuckin' tongue out your fuckin' mouth and stab the shit with a rusty screwdriver, BLAOWW!!
 I'll fuckin'  I'll fuckin  I'll fuckin' hang you by your fuckin' dick off a fuckin' twelve sto-story building out this motherfucker
 I'll fuckin'  I'll fuckin' sew your asshole closed, and keep feedin' you and feedin' you, and feedin' you, and feedin' you

Yo, roll the dice, yo, roll the dice
Yo, so it's goin' down like that, huh? Yeah?
Niggas is whylin', check it out, kid

The force of gravity is the force that the earth, moon, or any other large object attracts another object towards itself

I defy gravity
I am stronger than any force
I am Brooklyn

Gravity, Why you wanna be mad at me?
Like 9.803 pulling down at me
Meters per second squared
Acceleration
Im pushing back up (you know thats called) determination

Gravity wanted to battle said he had forces
Of course I took the battle had to show him who the boss is
Now Ill start to show you what the three newtons laws is
Move in line, stay in a line till a force is on it

Newton found gravity when an apple fell from a tree
The battle is over, in physics class i learned your history
Give me a minute let me describe Acceleration
Its the rate that an object suddenly-- changes motion
Gotta give it time-- seconds, minutes, hours
Let me break it down, Im stronger than Austin Powers

Gravity ain't got nothin on me or my force
You know we from Brooklyn so we holdin it down of course
I got a Hypothesis-- an educational guess
Who winning this rap battle, yall know who is the best
At the end of the day we putting gravity to a test
Hope my hypothesis is nothing but correct

Gravity-- are you still mad at me
You know Newtons law told you that
You cant handle me
Your actions of holding me down are battling with the constant force of energy




Mic Trippin' from rock skipping off the local brooks
Not knowing, heavyweight throwing vocal hooks
Rhyming off Apache, the RZA scratch thee
Records borrowed from Home Alone kid known as Latchkey
Break beat fanatic, crates deep in attics
45s marked up, looped with static
Rap ring heavy, each link in my chain, truck's Chevy
Flare ripped from the magic lair of medley
But deadly, I merge forward with a sharp spear
He must return now, his flight departs here
Like Sitting Bull, I lay with my bow pulled
Arrow poisonous cause my enemy clip's full
Stay in the venue, with the party promoters, life parolers
Half the crowd wild, 9 m&m holders
Apply boulders, smash your allied soldiers
Intimate footage roll off the cameraman's shoulders
Many will die for fame, moving like Leroy
Can't be one and the same, nah, that ain't b-boy
The decoy, scan this with high tech radar
Til' my mic strike, leave a state-size crater
I came into this with the writer's block
To prevent a sudden shock on a large flock
Clips are uncut episode, invincible armor
I blaze one, once I strike the match off my bomber


Adjust this, til its EQ'ed like never
Watch ya megawatts, bang spots, raise the lever
It's Operation Cobra, it's over
Control the globe slowly, the bold soldier


My rough cut metal tapes, quick to break label mates
Won't hesitate to negotiate your table stake
First lesson came from the session, room one
From the longest awaited but the strongest made it
Complex, complicated, compressed, elongated
Homicidal, subtitle, Wu claw, banger off the ocean shore
Kid jaw, cut with the jigsaw
Intern engineer, vest on the youth
Make the mic booth bulletproof from sparked wires
From autofire rapid from a verbalist slangster's gat
Two hit Tucker, she labeled it gangster rap
Unseen curve, struck the vital nerve
Of some sort, courts got papers to serve
Still bang 'em in the head, just lead, no eraser
One shot, no chaser, who ya replacer
You punch-drunk swinging your keys on your index
Showing off your Rolex, didn't see the Joe Tex
Filmed it on Bolex, smashed with the largest
Full finger, name ringer, life clinger






Brother, I think that necklace is causing you too much trouble


My necklace had the whole crowd on some next shit
The guest list full of real niggas that's hectic
The charm piece made my niggas move like calm beasts
Palm beats, two jostling niggas with long reach
Keep your eyes open for them strong on thieves
Out here looking for ice to put in they teeth
Chain glowing shining and I'm ready for beef
Like my nigga 2 Chainz, cappuccino from the east
From the Wu-Tang Clan, my necklace and my heat
Bang bang, different robe every day of the week
2 Angels, dinner plate, fat dollar sign
Universal flag on, nigga, I got shine




I keep my neck frozen, .45 loaded, please don't approach this
Rope is so ferocious, diamonds that shine in oceans
Keep you arm distant from my carats, silly rabbits
Make me get my barrel, spazzed out and cause havoc
Iced out Cubans, exotic stones from Africa
This the real thing, big bling, the chain swing
Try to swipe mines, that's a no no, the God's loco
Jewelry truckin' fancy spend stacks upon Delancey
Exhaust pipes coughing horse kicks
ACP's dress up the flesh, now the crime scene's gorgeous
My links is unbreakable, told y'all on the Purple Tape
40 inches hang from my neck, nigga, I'm wealthy




Why you say that?
It's real, kill a nigga for this shit
Aha, yo relax sis


Dinner plates rings, smothered in 2 pounds of dope
Eric B on the cut when it blings
Scrubbin' chain down in Colgate, double edged bangers
On they hips I wait in the jaw break
The snakes and the violators, Dracula style takers
We got a bunch of gold balls, but we ain't the Lakers
Hey bitches, stay lickin' my necklace
And I ain't even put the dumb bitch in the guest list
That's what you get when you throwin' on Cuban's
Drawers that's made from silk, a robe and a Ruger
Crack heads catchin' a sweet vix on a scooter
Catch me for my chain, it belongs on a shooter
Lucky my shit blow like a horn on a tuba
You might as well do me now cause I will do ya




God-Cipher-Love-Divine in math 79
Bright yellow and dense in its gift and shine
Still the same when exposed to air and water
Like when amongst thieves you  travellin' across the border
The brink of the metal link when in transition remains solid
The message was lost in transmission
That's often in a free elemental form
Nuggets and grains and rocks and things that's norm
Malleable ductile metal on many levels
Get you shot for a Flintstone, killed for a pebble
Lieutenants and Generals move with criminals
The pride for all in line, they hunt for mineral
The scope is on the rope, claws on the table
Brass knuckle, knees buckle, legs unstable
And it's sold by the weight
Shaped into a plate with food on it
The hungry wolves lie in wait




Tu Tin-To. So you're the tigers of Tinan, bastard, you're gonna pay for this, you'll die here. I'll use the tiger strike to kill you all. I'll show you the three different strokes. Forest Tiger! Win Tiger, Winmau Tiger!




I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Five score years ago, a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today


Look, homicide is illegal, death is a penalty
Never let go when you've got ahold of your enemy
Eagle claw cobra clutch by any means necessary
Ill never let it go, see my shadow ninja mic flow
I throw a great archer dart arrow to your temple
Almighty bow of Ulysseus the indigenous
Plan of the Wu-Tang Clan became a world brand
We never let it go, we talk a half a mil a show


Never let go of your mind
Its a terrible thing to waste
To lose, but its very hard to find
Being that ignorance is lethal
We must touch hearts, tune souls, harmonize the people
Never let go of your plan, execute
So when you shoot, inspire everyone on the land
Never lose knowledge of yourself
For it may become risk to your health
And great loss of wealth


Never let go of your cream, never let go of your dream
Players retire, but they never let go of the team
If you a rider then you never let go of that thing
Pull up your mans like you better let go of that bling
This lifes crazy, too many life sentences, maybe
Fatherless babies on the block but they father 380
Thats just the hood lately, never let go
Im what the hood made me
Momma told me to find a good lady


Never let go of staring at the death
Like yo, that's your best blow
I still hold on like En Vogue
The cold go to war with the heat
Eyes wide, never falling asleep
All the talking is cheap
Call'em, ultimate warrior, W.W.F
I come up victorious, struggle is nothing to Deck
Set it straight for the seeds, to see a better new
Take the real life by the rings and I aint letting go
I aint letting go


No matter what the odds be
No matter how hard we
You never let go


Never let go of the fight, never let go of the mic
My honesty, my values, my loyalty, my pride
And memory of those who have passed to the other side
Never letting go, Im never letting go of my beliefs
My faith, convictions, real
Both hands holding on, never let go the wheel
We hood legends, misunderstood
These lessons, learned
Growing up for manhood
Keep focus on the prize what you better do
A little taste of heaven, sunshine is where we headed to
States whats ahead of you, always on the schedule
Smoke the gold leaf down to the residue
Letting go, is something that I never do
Those who let go, live life regrettable
Never let go of your hope or your rope
Eyes on the prize, never let go of the scope
When Im in jail, never let go of the soap
Hold on, boy, never let go


Never let go, the all-eye-seeing, the supreme
Never let go the love of your seeds, or your queen
Never let go your heart, or the place you started
The feeling that I had, Wu-Tang had just charted
The old earth departed, I give thanks to the martyrs
I never let go the love I have for thy father
Never let go the glow
The more I know the more that it shows
I wont let go, even if I decompose
Your seed will carry it on, we need to carry it on
Pass the baton, life is just the marathon
And ain't' playing to win it, its an epidemic
Never let go, thats what the god recommended




And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. Who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. For many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom




Aiyo I roll like a Bat Out of Hell, evil acapell's fly
Spitting out of my grill before I hit the sky
With springtime colors, juicy as a Sunkist
Certain broads double Dutch this, they carve it in they wrist
Pillsbury blazes, straightening combs left on the stove
Crumbs in my lady hair, plus yours, the look gold
God, the old chain and ball technique, got these
Vegetable lasagne niggas in they whips, jumping out they seats
18 Bronzeman Part II
We like Dorothy Hamill on ice, we in your hood we might circle
Hats down low in the Range, switch lanes Change my tire, peel out, real loud on the stage yo
I shitted on your hood kid, I shitted on your hood
Got to your burner too late, I'm looking real good
Draped out, shining like a fresh fifty cent piece
"Yo girlfriend, come here, oh shit, you my man's niece"
The gourmet pocket twenty, bombs made of clay
Sexcapades take place, we fucking forty eight shades
Might walk up in your studio, time slap your engineer
Lighter fluid to DAT style, hand me the matches now


Aiyo rainbow Roley on the wrist, now what's this
Niggas bless this, eight and a half, Bally banana twist
E shakes, puffing on lye, feeding the seed's plate
Pulling out old .38s to rob gates
Major wake up, the kid tell tales, make a nigga head wake up
Beats break, the nigga whipped, take off his time
Honolulu status, gladdest, the rich rock cabbage
And dollar vans grands, that nigga mad savage
Stationary Hall of Justice, niggas came clumped out
Just came home, now they bunked out
Money be longer than triple life, till the Sun burn out
That's my word, move it with the burner out
Fidel way of thinking, roll with the Mac bent Ac-10
Most of my team, Five Percent
Check what the live said, rolling with Guess vests pedestrians
Yo, holding my nuts, fucking thousand dollar lesbians

 (x2)
Yo, the Older God put me on to how to rock this
Maintain 360 Lord live prosperous
It only takes a lesson a day, just to analyze life
One time in the respectable mind


Let the shot spark, soon as his pit bull barks
Tire scars from skid marks leaves from jams in school parks
Witness forget his original statement
Even in protection programs there's no escapement
Gunned down, three in town hit king from seven crowns
Spent rounds, catch him while he rhyme in the Zebra Lounge
Wounded, back in the '83 summer heat
Up in 3-0-9 park, rhyming off the drummer's beat
I stalk the city streets demonstrating mic wrecks
All looking stank, I ain't playing with a full deck
And as they nervously stare, I know they scared
They saw the coming of Wu in neon in Times Square
Household name assassin, Killa Bee
Mill to the grain that posess the Wu trilogy
Quick to spot those that bite camoflouge and blend
Those that got styles, they got identical twins
Don't stretch the small thing, copycats are finicky
Without skills, they master the art of mimicry
But I go line for line on the whole page
Your unspotted life on the mic is old age

{*rocket fired, whistles off and explodes, breaking glass*}




Yeah... Vinnie Paz, baby
Yeah... yeah... yeah


This is raw, all across the board, Liquid Sword Chamber
If it's coming from my jaw, then it's pure anger
Heavy metal rap, with a four four banger
We can settle that, let the mic cord hang ya
I play homage to the best of them, like Christopher Wallace
And bring drama to the rest of 'em, with biscuits from coppers
I'm with Allah justice, and we raw gritty
Picture hell, Illadel' to New York City
I brought a four with me, we can capture the ring
And now we more merciless than the Statue of Ming
And y'all more purposeless than a pacifist king
You gon' die, like a brawl with a gat in the Bing
It's a passionate thing, the way we make classics
Genuine brilliance or innate madness
Yeah, we all spin on the same axis
And this chrome thing here, leave your frame backless
The police always try'na aim flame at us
So I don't mind when the pig brain splatters
I don't mind, that we all gon' die soon
I return to the silence of God's tomb

Imagine a rhyme in it's prime, from off the baselines
Skyscraper verticals, support the hang time
Evidence that was left at the scene of the crime
Trace back to a few, from out a group of nine
Who performed well, regardless to the price of the tickets
Off or onstage, whatever, still kick it
With the footwork, of Freddie Adu, it's all new
Now the rap commissioners, they wanna clone my shoe
But the road's narrow, and it's difficult to climb
With the heat, the wind and the fallen rocks combined
It's hard to stay in line, the course is an obstacle
Within each chamber, the force is unstoppable
Lyrical swordsman, blades sharp, I cut out your heart
M.C.'s want no part, in any type of conflict
Because then I respond quick, it gets thick
The problem goes beyond sick

Those who dare oppose us shall stand knee deep in the blood of their children

And his abode in Hell, and it is an evil destination...)

Tenho um nigga de frias, tenho outro a trabalhar
Porque meus niggas querem paz, meus niggas querem uma vida
Tenho outros niggas de frias, outros niggas a trabalhar
Ao contrario os teu em sofs, parados a crescer barriga
Os meus niggas aguentam-se, no fogem se minoria nas brigas
E ao contrario dos teus niggas, no falam a torto e direito
Os meus niggas movimentam-se, nem que seja para o interldio
Os teus se nao h boleia para o estdio, nao h musica nao h respeito
Os meus niggas fazem obras de arte, pinturas sem contas
Os teus niggas acham-se arte, porque recitam obras prontas
Os meus niggas fazem covas, usam nas depois do ataque
Os teus niggas s trincheiras, suas covas depois do abate
Os meus niggas, bebedeira e fumo, merda feita de qualquer maneira
Os teus niggas tambm.. como? quando esto de caganeira
Os meus niggas nem so muitos, andam por ai espalhados
Os teus niggas sempre juntos, mesmo assim preocupados
Tenho niggas, tenho niggas, tenho-os em todo o lado
Tu tens niggas, niggas e niggas, mas eles esto  do meu lado
Por isso  que eu acho essa merda, uma jogada suicida

Yeah, killa, The GZA, La
Live, yeah, what yo


My clan is like USA the way we conquer
Lay back, grow more chocolate than Willy Wonka
Stomp ya, till your head bleed, your mouth bleed
Running wit the heart of slave that's been freed
Triple Darkness, wild like a killer from Spofford
Heartless, trained to hit moving targets
Profit, .357 cock it
Kill you, leave you wit your money in your pocket
My logic - money, bitches, land and lessons
Allah blesses, me wit automatic weapons
Scholastic, geographic, stay Jurassic
Running through Medina wit the Glock plastic
Rotten fruit, Black Je-sus, I got juice
Darkman move swift as a mongoose


Yo, niggas caught plaque from biting off the platinum
Dumb MCs caught the gum disease, ask them
Who style they took, two wild rooks
Tried to take a page when I'm the author of the book
At twenty-seven years young, y'all some old timers
I write wit invisible ink, y'all use eye liners
Define rhymers, the question and the answer
The DJ and the dancers, check



You ever seen someone who roll
With Mayweather, rhyme like Ricky Hatton
Smash whatever you throw, a thousand is what I'm battin'
Got a few hooks with no jabs
Took 'em out ya corndog books and notepads
I get it, you got rich robbin' those in the industry
Bite off this one, steal from your enemy
Never try to play the hottest one out ya camp
He might step off and take half the joules from ya amp
Enough to make ya Vogue on that cover of GQ
Only missin' the sheer blouse, homey, you see through
Stop sippin' on that Formula 50
They want heat? I give it to 'em, burnt and crispy
Rhymes too short to box with God, so stretch it
Especially these over-rated raps, step to fetch it
I told you if I rain, there'll be an eternal drizzle
Woodwork strips bein' chipped from sharp chizzles
One verse shatter your spine and crush your spirit
If you was a pimp, put tricks on the stroll
And if those were soldiers, give 'em bigger guns to hold
Who shot ya? You don't have enough on your roster
You move like a fed, but you talk like a mobster
That yayo you slingin', please abort it
Too many cuts on it, cokeheads, they won't snort it
I spray the Flea Unit with pesticides, and you can get
Your best ghost writers, get 'em all to testify
Have you ever been stung by a thousand hornets?
Five hundred Killa Beez, buzzin' and really on it
Whipped with Cuban Linx, and cut with Liquid Swords
Choked by Ironmen 'til we crush your vocal chords
You ain't nothin' but a pig in the blanket
Hog head, the deadliest food at the banquet
All this rap crap, that's trapped in your colon
Only means, get rid of the wack shit you holdin'
Sweet tooth dudes stay out the candy shop
You ain't gotta handcuff 'em to see the panties drop
A few cats is lookin' for a rat with cheese
Got somethin' to pitch, they all swing a bat with ease
Get your ankles broke, while doin' your two-step
Leave a thank you note, for the crutches the Wu left
ProActive rap, you know they put drug in the cream
You hallucinate and see Kanye in your dream
And yo, I don't smoke dust, I dust off Smokey and the Bandits
With the brush stroke off the canvas
I walk on your gators and lizards, raise the lynx
That was killed for your minks, you be rockin' in blizzards
Wanna be cop, 'til you walk to D-Block
And get entranced for us, spread your wings like peacocks
I was an MC when you was in Nutville
On a world tour, you was gettin' your guts filled
Ten years MC'ing, but I flow like I'm twenty-one
Straight from Medina, with the mass of many suns
The supernova, give off gamma ray bursts
And I'll finish this, only 'cause I let off first, what's up

This school year I had the opportunity to teach one 9th grade living environment section in addition to my other, all chemistry, classes of 11th graders. I have to say that the maturity level and skill levels are so very different as was expected. My 9th graders struggle with reading and writing much more so than the incoming 9th graders last year. When I heard about the opportunity to be a part of the Rap Genius battles from Chris Emdin, the science coach for our school, I wanted to be a part of it. I wanted these 9th graders to feel successful in science despite their skill deficits. I knew they would be more engaged with science vocabulary and science concepts if they were a part of this opportunity. My students look forward to their weekly opportunity to write down their lyrics. It has supported the instruction in my classroom, because the students have to understand the science vocabulary in order to write a lyrics that are academically sound. It forces them to think of more abstract and more concrete ways of conceptualizing and visualizing the vocabulary, simultaneously. It makes them think! It makes them think about science and write about it, in their own personal way

As a teacher, teaching a Regents terminating course, it is very scary to do something like this because it takes up precious instructional time that is already limited, so the challenge has been to keep up with the curriculum and still providing the students enough time to generate their raps. I attempt to allow them at least 30 minutes per week but sometimes it ends up being just 15 minutes due to the jam-packed curriculum. I believe it is helping many of the students, however, because they are able to use and engage with the Regents vocabulary in their lyrics

I was surprised to see Ryan Rivera, a student who exhibits low engagement during class discussions and share-outs, perform scientifically sound rap lyrics, with such animation. It was inspiring to see him

I am looking forward to each of the student groups performing their full 16 bars. As of yet, most of the student groups have not completed full 16 bars.

I am very grateful to Science Genius, Chris Emdin and GZA for promoting science in such a RELEVANT way for young people! THANK YOU!!

No stems no seeds that you don't need
Acapulco gold is BAD ASS WEED


Yo this is the Gka-gka-Genius
And I got the brother Prince Rakeem on the side
You know we got the sess bones in the house
And yo God I'mma pass you the bone
(Pass the bone kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, so I can rule the microphone)


Rakeem is feeling lovely, word a pocket full of dough
A little drunk, reaction's mad slow
Thinking, should I go to the club scene
And do what? And bag a rub-a-dub queen
Another thing, beyond the cream, I wanted to get ripped
Put my lips on a blunt tip
It's been two weeks, since I last sparked it (what'd you do?)
Went down to the club floors
Five dollar fee, plus ID
But a brother like me, gassed his way in for free
Word, took a bar seat
Got a tall glass, of Sex on the Beach
Turned to my left, saw this girl she was slamming sir
Oooh, what ya do kid? I examined her
Pushed up, I tried to bag her, for her name
What happened? I didn't have the game
Overwhelmed, by a scent in the air
Could it be? Yes, yeah, a potent bag of sess there
It was Raekwon and Loungin' Lo
They had a bone, you mean a blunt? A palmetto
I said pass the bone, pass the bone
Pass the bone kid, pass the bone
They passed it, took one pull I was blasted
Felt kind of stimulated, fan-tastic
Re-approached the weak-cypher
Did you surprise her? I tranquilized her
Bagged her, for her name and address
Slid to her rest, achieved mad success
But did you bone her? Did I bone her?
Did I bone her; you should've heard her moan


Pass the bone, pass the bone
Pass the bone kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone kid, pass the bone
Yo Genius, flip the microphone
Yo, pass the bone, kid pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid pass the bone
Pass the bone so I control the microphone


Yo check it
Outside a nightclub what? We shine some young bloods
Drinking forties right down to the suds
Ready to flow inside and rip the mic phone
Hmm, and all I needed was a sess bone
And guess who come down the block stumbling drunk
(Who?) Ason, with two bags of skunk
Pull out the blunt put the weed inside
Roll it up tight, then the flame was applied
Inhale, but not pertaining to cough
Exhale, you know like two pulls and off
Stimulated kind of toxie
Seen a girl who was foxy, yo but she needed
OxyWash, oh my gosh, yo not to disrespect
But back to the subject
The brothers rolled up on the scene that I had known
Smelled the skunk and said "Yo pass the bone!"
I said, "Lounge G" there's not enough to pass around
So go get a bag from Uptown
I gave a pound to the brothers who was sweating me
What about the Wisdoms? Yo they was stressing me
"Hey Genius, Genius, when ya gonna Come Do Me
Step to me, you know screw me?"
Just another redbone, that I had bagged in the red zone
And took home to get my head flown
Forget about the weak-cypher, so I slid to the back
Leaving tracks of smoke stacks
That originated from the sess crops
Give me the mic and watch me get props






He was raised in a house, where he got scarce attention
Twisted, yet methodical mind, not to mention
Circus like atmosphere, story book upbringing
Neighborhood full of married couples who loved swinging
Preacher lived life, he spent it in the spotlight
A teacher was his wife who was stabbed and shot twice
They attended a church, where they both were active
And a little bit of rope, he gave others attracted
He rule with the iron hand, if the meal wasn't hot enough
Then he'll swing the frying pan
Heavy as the hammer of Thor
You know he suffer from the consequences
Of broken vowels and law
A convicted felon for armed robbery
At the time where he had sank into deep poverty
Forsaken by his mother and father, Christ achieving the talent
He attended the sheet on the path of destruction


And these prisons held yesterdays juvenile delinquents
Convicts who entered crime, even before they entered puberty (on the path of
Destruction)
They remember how old I was when I first got in trouble
Me? Around nine, nah, six, seven


He ended up on the block with kid scooters and ice cream
But in and out of foster homes, until he was 19
Stealing for food and didn't do for enjoyment
At the time of lay off, shut down and unemployment
He moved into a new world, to seek his fortune
And suited himself to the times with extortions
A hustle that was ruled by men and murder
He earned enough for his daily bread and wanted to move further
He knew no good, could come from such a sin
Had issues as a kid, so he held it all within
And he pursued the game so hotly, on a path of destruction
Even though the road was rocky
Very caught up in his own drive for dominance
And to know that he would pay in the end was common sense
Some say he had a long deserved death
And then he felt relieved when they were told he left


These young civilians move to an assault and battery
Plus, mortal techniques, breaking and entering, burglary
Purse snatching (on the path of destruction)
Shoplifting, hand graffiti, crash and stolen property
Possessing and distribution of narcotics
Illegal possession of weapon, assaulting a police officer
Larceny (on the path of destruction)




The echo chamber enhance the flow wit the block party
Keep an MC head spinning like Dark Bacardi
This B.A.C. is 2.3
Now the liver's damaged, but his lungs are joint free
So inhale, exhale, breathe and get well
Kick something live stop chirping like Nextel
I'm All In Together, a swordsman forever
I paint the town red, with many heads are severed
R-A-W, I still bring trouble to
Throw your raps in the sleephold, quick to smother you
Dart heat your breastplate, meet ya death date
Rook down a E4, look, it's checkmate
No other way to describe a catastrophe
The plan was drawing blood and displayed it graphically
Direct order, hit the border, then slaughter
Horrific torture, by prolific authors
Shape and mold MC's, like I'm playing the skelly top
It's getting 'hot in here' like the single that Nelly dropped
So take ya clothes off, the track is so soft
A little vodka turn 'em into Ivan Koloff
Why do the Gods make MC's study from
Thirty five, and fifty year, then try to become
Under the study with the sword above the head
So he would keep in mind under the open pledge


Fierce glisten, something so sharp
Piercing, swords cling, the vigilante intimate
Close combat, this is emceeing at its best
But there is no contest, sent I'm this
Speaking of a test, this and try to question this
He so different with the swiftness, godfather civilization
Shell casing, universal nation
Could he be the one predicted, presidential sent in
Old school soul survivors, we the wildest
Asiatic Arctic flow is so frigid


Is it, the Zig Zag, I'mma pay you a visit
Somehow mistake me as an old wise wizard
Word? I'm not the same
I go somewhere, don't remember how I came
Is it the weed, the hash or the 'caine?
Or the Digi being stained on my brain
Appear from a cloud of smoke, the voter's on choke
If surrounded, seven men drop from one stroke
Even if my feet was shackled down to one handcuff
To defeat me, ten demons wouldn't be enough
I sleep in the lion's den, without the steel iron
Ascended like Musa coming down from Mt. Zion
Superlogical this, superlogical that
Digital, take it back with superlogical rap
Have a shootout, at midnight, the sequel's quicker
Forty four colt jolt, all you seen was the flicker
You distress like the damsel, lost like little 'Hansel'
Your flame couldn't generate the heat of a candle
Me, I be a Killa Bee, keeping exilery
Ol' play the desert e, shoot ten millime'
Master the millipede, you try to end the sea
Your body being found in the naval yard artillery
A black blind governor, a rich white mayor
Man, this whole city ain't got a prayer
Bobby has invaded, now the whole town's slated
Your decapitated head is being tooken' out paraded
Up and down the avenue, I drive a shatterproof
Benz, and all my men's are tattle proof
My mic is a dyke, my life is a light
A Day to God is a Thousand Years, how long is a night?
You get trapped in my shadow of dark, hark, who goes there?
Power-U smells like carp, don't put your nose there
Drop you to a tank of sharks, your wound's bleeding
And it's been two weeks since they had their last feeding
Any leftover bones, we grind into sand
And spread it out, over 20 acres of land
Some call me Steels, cause it's hard to bend me
See Cipher Pigs can't apprehend me
In a no smoking zone, I smoke bones of hash
Niggas see me, then I disappear in the flash
Next time I'm spotted, I got the fatter wallet
Moving with a clique that stick like dry porridge
Someone's been sitting in my chair, who goes there?
To sub zero cold, your words can't flow here
Glaciers of ice, plus layers of spice
Say your prayers at night, 'fore you touch that mic



When I hold a mic in my hand, it's devotion
Then I began flowing in a smooth steady motion
Cause I'm contented to know that I've invented
Poetry which has been highly complimented
Thus how I rhyme is what I feel on stage
And from a fraction of a thought I can write a whole page
I'll just pull a notebook from off the shelf
And like Salt-N-Pepa I express myself
To make most of you know me, and some of you don't
But when it comes to cold challenging, I bet none of you won't
Arrange a battle, improve your style
Against a brother with a totally different profile
Most of you flake cold front ya flex
And hesitate on rhymes that should've been Memorex
But you forgot I remember you're an amateur
Mystery worshipper, now prefer
ThatI remind you or tease ya on who's the boss
Cause you suffer amnesia, that's memory loss
Well get this just as quiet as it's kept
MC's on the chart from the start has slept
Let's shake them,wake them, they should be woke
For what? They take MC'ing for a practical joke
You don't have what it takes to be an MC
Ya just as phony as ya wanna be

You present yourself to be the quiet storm
You're a sneaky littlesnake in a devilish form
But as they say, yo, to each its own
And to each one who plays with a microphone
Abbreviate microphone and M.I.C
Meaning what, Myself, I, you see
I invite those to battle me then they're through
Bust it, i'mnot prejudiced you're invited too
The rap convention or the MC show
I have rhymes to block those who hit below
The belt, that means biting a rhyme
Yes, I'll wax you, tax you and plus save time
Now who is known to uphold his own
And words are heard like a strong baritone
Freestyle techniques that's wild and bold
That'll smile in your face and still come so cold
That I'll freeze you to the point of non-defrost
Now you're trapped in the Land Of The Lost
Should I, could I, would I lose
When it's a selfish sore loser like you I choose
To roll your big eyes and suck your buck teeth
Because you're upset that you ever caused beef
Yo homeboy, I never meant to tease
But it's a slaughter, can someone help him please
Feeling uncomfortable, then loosen your belt
Once The Genius gets heated up, suckers will melt
Then after ya melt, ya start dripping like water
Then you can say this was a Goddamn slaughter
You don't have what it takes to be an MC
Ya just phony as ya wanna be

Ain't no rhymes like the one I got
They put competitors in a trance, y'all
Radio stations ran them a lot
They made children play and dance y'all
How dare ya mention you're an MC
When the crowd disagrees on who claim to be
Cause your battle piece are the rhymes you release
And that only make the crowd boos increase
Hey, may I say I'll slay a DJ
MC who try to defeat me or portray
One who claims he gain much respect
But in a battle, straight up and down ya getting wrecked
Cauise getting with me is definitely a slaughter
Or diving in a pool head first without water
So don't set yourself up to get brutalized
That only happens when you're not energized
Bit I'm so damn energized, I'm energetic
That I can wreck a microphone 'til it's pathetic
Oka, got it in your head, correct
That I'm victorious on any subject
You disbelieve, then huh, call the title
Then after one rhyme you'll be calling me your idol
It's like..zap...another one on my jock strap
Now you walk around praising my name
Cause I'm slamming and I make you feel the pain
You don't have what it takes to be an MC
Ya just phony as ya wanna be




We invaded Mars in parachutes
Size of Colosseums
Scale had to find the attributes
Whispers of space left over
From the moment of creation, down to the deaths of supernovas
A million light years away
The thermometer
Much differently like our neighbor
The Andromeda
Hydrogen gas cooled down and started forming
Clusters of stars that we begin swarming
Start a chemical chain and read it like a clock
And, if you can tell time, it's a beautiful thing to watch
By measuring the brightness of a star
According to the hydrogen burning in the core, you see the lightness
I am made up of layers, extreme pressure
Tectonic activity from such conveyors
A big ball of melted metal
99% percent of the planet explored on such a level


Ignition sequence starts
Ignition sequence starts
Ignition sequence starts


The dark like a rocket, many miles per hour
Global warming threatening MCs for power
Strictly hell fire, the ice caps melt
Oxygen, water, and food for thought is dealt
Space is so vast like a puck on ice
I glide across the track and never think twice
A little energy goes a long way
Electrically-charged, I move so fast, a year is one day
Deep-space quest to leave Earth
Away from the force that has shaped up all our lives since birth
Without Hip-Hop I'm like a fish out of water
Flappin' instead of rappin' and my days are shorter
The absence of sound weakens my muscles
The beauty of the divine art makes me hustle
Delivering hell storms of rap articles
Well-planned, detailed, intricate, methodical


Ignition sequence starts
Ignition sequence starts
Ignition sequence starts

I keep blunts of sess in between my jaws
I keep chunks of flesh, underneath my claws
Animal like, raping lady Afro-Dite
I watch people bleed to tease my appetite
Slice your mug, we're hand-and-knife thugs
That's so hardcore we banned from fightclub
Brawl with night crawling blood alcoholics
Y'all only hope is wooden stakes and garlic
Islamic, thinking on a higher logic
Dressed in arab garments on flying carpets
Taking me to hovering starships
With high powered aero nautics
To glide across cosmics
Lost in space, I pause to meditate
My soul's energy cause walls to shake
Niggas stand clear when my land is spread
Cause my scarecrow's got real Klansmen heads


I'm from the place where temples could flare, eagles are hurt
A neighbourhood wear from steady went to shirt
A battlefield setting the teams, they move thugly
A group with a bitter dispute that turned ugly
Beef that started back in elementary
Then it move from the block to the penetentiary
The contest of the phonecall was frightning
The spark from the blaze to kill all was lightning
Completely unaware of their surrounding
In a +pool of blood+ responsible for drownings
The un-informed remains a total darkness
The only time you see light is when this metal spark this set
Something greater than their own encounter
Took a small business and they killed the co-founder
Now police probe this youngster's background
Found something in his jeans that was hard to back down


Yo, I release agression
Explode like automic weapon
Going to deep spells of demonic posession
Gave the devil my rhyme book, just to read through
He hid it in a safe that he had swallowed the keys to
Said:"Jus Allah, I have nothing to teach you"
There's no plauge or harm to man more deceitfull
Than a lost breed of evil
Fucking monsterous niggas
Trained to kill inside their subconcious
Taken what's promised, derived from skies and comets
Accomplish Prophecies from Muhammed
I overpower shit, fuck the hater and the doubter shit
Chop off the top of your skull, drink out of it
Cowardly bitch I hear death in the wind
Notify next of kin, best of friends
You limbs are lobbed off, by Jus Allah's axe
Forced to whack their own severed arms to catch

DJ: "Whatchu wanna hear?"
C: "I wanna hear that Wu-Tang joint."
DJ: "Wu-Tang again?"
C: "Ah yeah, again and again."


I smoke on the mic like "Smokin' Joe" Frazier
The hell-raiser, raisin' hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider-Man
So uhh, tick tock and keep tickin'
While I get you flippin' off the shit that I'm kickin'
The Lone Ranger, code red: Danger
Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart
The vandal too hot to handle
You battle, you're sayin' goodbye like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspectah Deck's on the set
The Rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal


The way I make the crowd go wild
Sit back, relax, won't smile
Rae got it goin' on, pal
Call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat
Blow up your project, then take all your assets
'Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, go flip on the next man
'Cause I grab the clip and
Hit you with 16 shots and more, I got
Goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh


It's the Method Man, for short Mr. Mef
Movin' on your left, UH!
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break, fool, cock me back
Small change, they puttin' shame in the game
I take aim and blow the nigga out the frame
And like Fame my style will live forever
Niggas crossin' over, but they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a "Suuu"?
Nuff respect due to the 1-6-oooh
I mean ohhh, yo, check out the flow
Like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off, because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt make me *cough*


Ooh, what, grab my nut, get screwed
Oww, here comes my Shaolin style
True B-A-ba-B-Y-U
To my crew with a "Suuuuuuu"


C'mon, baby baby, c'mon, baby baby
C'mon, baby baby, c'mon


Yo, you best protect ya neck


First things first, man, you're fuckin' with the worst
I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a fuckin' nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zu
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down, that shit is packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin'
Ason Unique rollin' with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
Bite my style, I'll bite your motherfuckin' ass


For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
There's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats; if Rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stompin' grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin' star
'Cause who I are is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar
Point-blank as I kick the square biz
There it is, you're fuckin' with pros, and there it goes


Yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that
It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feelin' mad hostile, wearin' Aropostale
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy robe, then attack the globe
With the buck-us style, the ruckus
Ten times ten men committin' mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums
(He'll be) comin' around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one down
Ju-Jugger-Genius, take us the fuck outta here


The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap
That's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact, bring out the girls, and let's have a mud fight!


You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck




Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to welcome to you
All the way from the slums of Shaolin
Special uninvited guests
Came in through the back door
Ladies and gentlemen, it's them!


Dance with the mantis, note the slim chances
Chant this anthem, swing like Pete Sampras
Taking it straight to Big Man On Campus
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Scandalous, made the metro panic
Cause static with or without the automatic
And while I'm at it, yo, you got cash, pass it
It's drastic, gotta send half to Dirty Bastard


Waves is spinning, blades is spinning
Slay em in the eighth inning
Stay truck, god stay playing linen
Kill rap, observe the uptowns, ho, feel that
Mink jeans on, seen where the real at
2000 Zitos, moving with a ill ego
For real, for real, ill lines, ill people
Yo, bring it back, 9 more civilians
Pollying deals, monopoly and bills, y'all niggas lying
Caught 300, lab look royal wit a mean stomach
Go broke, all seen, done it
Words from the heavy set, if I don't eat, then we already met
Fly ass bro, liver than coke


Now what Clan you know with lines this ill?
Bust shots at Big Ben like we got time to kill
Niggas can't gel or I'm just too high to tell
Put on my gasoline boots and walk through Hell
With 9 generals, 9 ninjas in your video
9 milli blow, semi-auto with no serial
Man metaphysical, I speak for criminals
Who don't pay they bills on time and fuck with digital
Never seen, smoke a bag of evergreen
My sword got a Jones, more heads for the severing
Johnny in the dungeon, taking all bets, throw ya ones in
Scared money don't make money, throw ya guns in


That's word to Damo, San Juan, Puerto Rico
Blowin hydro on a beach wit Tamiko
My gun bullet hollow for you to swallow
Blowin' the nozzle, hear it whistle
One in the head, this is code red, man for dead
X amount of lead spray from the barrel
Heat clear the street like Connor O'Carroll
Fully equipped, rifles, banana clip shit
To make my niggas from East New York flip


Yo, you may catch me in a pair of Polo Skipperys, matching cap
Razor blades in my gums (BOBBY!)
You may catch me in yellow Havana Joe's goose jumper
And my phaser off stun (BOBBY!)
Y'all might just catch me in the park playin' chess, studyin' math
Signin 7 and a sun (BOBBY!)
But you won't catch me without the ratchet, in the joint
Smoked out, dead broke or off point (BOBBY!)


Wallo's comfortable, chocolate frosting
Your socks hangin' out, yours is talkin'
Rock so steadily, son, I'm still crazy
Sport my old Force MD furs from the 80's
Nat Turners wit burners, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Taught y'all niggas how to rap, reimburse me
Rothsdale's, ruby red sales, Bloomingdale's, blocks
Ox tails chopped up in Caribbean spots
I'm nice, maxed out, creepin' wit the ax out
Murder these bikini bitches, switchin with they backs out


Niggas wanna pop shit, I pop clips
Bitch, I'll put my dick on ya lips
Alabama split, hammer slay quick
That David Banner gamma ray shit
Shells in the mouth, jailhouse snitch
My powder voice, Snow White sniff
Verbal killas, gorilla grip
God body shit, puff Marley spliffs


You might see me in a 6, that's not my style
You might see me wit a bitch, that's not my child
I be in the benzo, keep a low profile
Dead serious, take flicks and don't smile
Tryin' to get money, y'all cats is wild
I pose for the clothes, make a song like wild
I'm a chip off the board game, got sword game
Live life to the fullest, still want more fame
Darts on layaway, beats on standby
Outfits pressed up, ready for airtime


Run on the track like Jesse Owens
Broke the record flowin', without any knowin'
That my wordplay run the 400 meter relay
It's on once I grab the baton from the DJ
A athlete wit his iron cleat in the ground
Wireless nigga who sprint off the gun sound
The best time yet still 7.0
Swift flow made the cameramen clothes blow




Who be first to catch this Beat Down?
My RapPages be The Source
Ego Trip remain victory and no loss
Rap Sheet show you Details of wars in streets
Where the most live catch Vibe and Blaze heat
Double XL kings who rush through got Right On
Quick to Stress ya sound crew to get a mic on
Math lets the plates Spin
Consecutive hits, promoters' face grin
The dawn catch fist, keep the paper direct wire, see MJ retire
Unlike the story that echoes out from chronic liars
Like those who feast on hogs, eat Murder Dogs
A Village Voice kid with his heart and soul calm
Killa Beez produce the honey that fortify the platinum
Plus the DJ claws fiend to scratch them
Thus street team take shots at criticism
Promotional vehicles wiffin with mad rhythm
With the lockout of one of our Source Sports
We spice the stand and launch the stage on the ball court
During the first half, number one draft
Rap lords swing swords, slam microphone, shatter Billboards
Forty-eight in sight after inhaling the herb
Vision impaired when the silhouette emerged
One nut out the Clan
Get your whole clique banned from radio
PDs cut your raps man
Forcing me to move on from one world to another
On the gulf from the fuel Jet to hover
Take cover wit the radical Urban Latino
No Hip-Hop Connection wit Us and Janet Reno
I do an interview and they aim to trace my Essence
To know more than is necessary blunts your weapon
My group's Nova, remain unsober
And serve High Times with king cobras
I shoulder low-post MCs, your whole style la feast
Second to get your Word Up then the troops unleash
Creative Loafing to the grand opening
With my ray gun scoping, you're hoping
Uniforms be fridged when they walk the Black Beat
In the heat of razors exposing fresh meat
In Bedrock and Gambling, Rolling Stone out of zone
Where they can't monitor my 'xact poem
Collide with the Tiger Beat, Rap et Ragga
Ebony eyes, folks see the saga






"Am I a good man? ..."


Take my hands out my pockets you can see my thumbs
Both of them turned green from counting the ones
Memorized by the glory, word life
Cut off niggas who killed good but couldn't do nothing for me
Shout 'em out every once in the blue
And kid yo, I never rocked with laws they keep away, we cool
I devised my own stimulus plan, I'm niggarish
I'm tired of eating those crumbs and black licorice
To free my mind on Friday, I cleanse in the mosque
Let the imam pray over my head and wash
Thoughts, sterilized, purified, Godly
Watch us gift men and fetch the green like barley
If that shit happen I'll feed his whole army
Talking 'bout the angels and peeps in Somali
Try to stay humble and swallow my pride
In God I trust, now talk about the ones on your five
Crisp dollar billing, catch me in a little hut in Benin
Village style, feeding the children
Big pots of jasmine tea with Mandela
Africans chanting me on like Coachella
Ghostface Bumaye, Kumbaya my Lord
My death day, 24 karat tomb I lay
Wishing they could bury me next to the prophets
Nabi, Lut, Is'a, Musa, Hadrat Muhammad, Ibrahim

"Am I a good man?" (I don't know)
"Am I a fool?" (We'll see)


The Lord takes me, gathering speeds before winds
High currents, distance, places be forming wings
Kings offering, thrones was there
Man with the seven crowns on his dome was near
Feet walked over rose petals sold from the ghetto
Face froze in gold like the pharaoh
Adorned in glory, robe of light, a power for his cherub
As He passed the path, white doves crossed the eyes of thugs
Eternal heartbeat and the dark fire in his blood
Seven hundred books were opened
Embraced to write, then threw the crooks in the ocean
Skin brass hair like it grew from goatskin
The chosen has spoken, tablets were broken
The smoke hand grabs an omen
Gravity grabbing me gradually, dragging me through Hell's cavity
This is blasphemy, I fell where the jackals feed
God felt bad for me but cast me in the Caspian Sea
Satan gave the dragon his key, Wu-Family's the faculty
K.P., K.P

"Am I a good man? Am I a fool?
"Am I?"


He used to sling in the stairwell
Fast to put the rap on a thinking cap, ignite your hair gel
No such thing as the fair sale
He'll put the bullet out same day, delivery airmail
And on this level a thug will sell your garbage
No refund, the only exchange from the cartridge
But the users just kept coming back with their life earnings
Ready to make a deal, soul and pipe burning
The outcome tragic, the household dramatic
Living rooms for heating spoons, basements for addicts
Support from a bean, hit the courts from a fiend
Who betrayed one, who had lit the torch for his team
So he sent them gifts, body parts per diem
In a box that held prints but too dark to see 'em




She dated jolly green GIANTS, that, flew on JETS
An A-list actress, who was never walked off sets
She loved stuffed animals, especially BEARS
Was a role model, like a CARDINAL to our peers
A PATRIOTIC tomboy, like Mary Ellen from The Waltons
A former lifeguard, who had the skills of a DOLPHIN
When I met her, she was in drama school and wore BENGALS
Drove a BRONCO, and she was far from star spangled
Had basic skills, and worked part time in mills
Raised buffalo's, cause she was behind them BILLS
Had a man who always roared like LION
A domestic violent cat, tackled the girl and kept her crying
Couldn't care, she was losing her hair, from depression
She was in the air, and there was some room for interceptions
I told her to stay strong, not to be ashamed
You're a "ten-i-see", you just need to TITAN your game
Her ancestors were CHIEFS, who ran with running deer
On the sail with the SEAHAWKS, who battled the BUCCANEERS
The REDSKIN garments, was suede coat liners
Held rare coins, frequently sought from gold miners
They were hard working warriors, we call over timers
Shot plenty arrows at COWBOYS and 49ERS
Her interesting background, but quite unusual
Great for a script, but out of bounds for a musical
She told me to call her, if I came to town
I started TEXAN her, soon as my plane had touchdown
Holding my luggage, in the hand that revealed the bad scars
She pulled up at arrivals, driving the JAGUAR
Her BROWN skin was soft, her legs beautifully shaven
Her house was fly, sitting on the roof, was a RAVEN
As we entered, I heard laughter
She walked into a large living room, I went after her
There was two of her, girlfriends, playing chess like they were VIKINGS
Militant as PANTHERS, they're resemblance was striking
Had on thongs, high heels, and belts that was garter
Energized like phones that just came off the CHARGER
I introduced myself to gain yardage
Cuz anything less then smooth, would've been straight up garbage
The shorter one met me, when I had a sky pager
Thought I rolled with robbers, STEELERS and panty RAIDERS
She took fruit from the orange bowl, it was in season
One of them said she loved the juice and kept squeezing
I knew that I was gonna get, wined and dined
It would've been a penalty, not to pass the scrimmage line
Now I laid back and relaxed, waiting for the kick-off
One removed the lip gloss, like she was bout to lick all
She caressed me, with fingertips soft as velvet
Dying for me to PACKER, as she stroked my helmet
And I was thinking these girls was SAINTS
But it was first and ten, and there was extra walls to paint
Before you know it, I had all three in a huddle
Buckin' like a COLT, before I released them puddles
They spread EAGLES like wide receivers
As I RAM them in the endzone, and they became true believers


I be liking chess
Cuz chess is crazy, right there, that's the ultimate
It's like a great hobby right there, playing chess
The board, the pieces, the squares, the movement
You know, war, capturing, thinking, strategy
Planning, music, it's hip-hop, and sports
It's life, it's reality





This concept is applied to all lives
We stride times distance
Ill let you be a witness to the prize
Be a man, understand
You comprehending this is vital, work = FD
The equation for survival;
Your only rival is friction dont get caught up in the drag
So you better prepare cuz obstacles fight back
When you get knocked down though dont please dont cry
Just get up and apply more force next time
One day I was dreaming with a really strong hope
That Ill make it but to make it takes more than just believing
These resistance slash demons were kinda holding me back
And I letem but the simple way to get me on track was
Force times displace, Is work no debate
Ill take that concept apply it to my mistakes
And now Im progressing a natural Rap Genius
And Ima get an A if I see this on the regent



Heres the lesson, I know it kinda hurts but if you truly want to work than there must be progression cause
FD=W the rule and the unit measurement for the product is called joules, Cool
I did the work Ima try to let it flow the more people I know kinetic energy grows so
Ima go to work convert all of my potential, and as my speed increases then Ima grow exponential



The work has been applied if my equations are correct
The energy that is left creates a domino effect
My mass is what Im bringing to the table underestimate
Youll wish that you had brought a bigger dinner plate
Separate me from the fakes let me educate
Velocitys my following and thats Ima generate
Through these shows and gigs and just overcoming all the friction
To the point where friction doesnt even make a difference
I feed my interest with the laws of physics
When m and v multiply the picture is painted vivid
The work was just something that got me inside the door
Now we, squaring the v and its exponentially more
I got a lot in store the vs
Cuz Im progressin my m
And when you multiply them
Theres no end to the kinetic energy
You better be prepared
Cause Im fillin you up with envy with my  m v2



Heres the lesson, I know it kinda hurts but if you truly want to work than there must be progression cause
FD=W the tool and the unit measurement for the product is called joules, Cool
I did the work Ima try to let it flow the more people I know kinetic energy grows so
Ima go to work convert all of my potential, and as my speed increases then Ima grow exponential




You will be punished (Wu-Tang style)
For all your evil deeds (Wu-Tang style)
Be warned - you will suffer (Wu-Tang style)
Justice (Wu-Tang style)


Slept on this hazardous enterprise
Hit from the back, from a long range attack in disguise
Week self-captivity became months
Those who were holdin' it down they hold a pump
Do we delay the conflict and prolong the suffer?
Got a mass of starvin' niggas wanna eat supper
Unfair corruptions lead to abductions
Creatin' wider circles of destructions
So we attack, with the pen and blaze in
From the terrifyin' to the fascinating
Quick to slay a narrow minded nigga that's hasty to give credit
Full of hostile overtones mixed with wack edits
They heavily defended airfields
But they bodies rot behind punctured steels
When I greeted you, you didn't hear a piece of my voice?
Oh that water was my liquid of choice
Forensic couldn't tell it, it was nine tons of steel pellet
Powerful projection, noise is deafening
Carrier battle groups, that's threatening
Higher level bombing, plus
The shipment in hand known as alarming, bells ring loud
In the same crucial manner but different style


Wu-Tang style
Wu-Tang style


Ayo once again, all blunts again
Yo the real remain silent, any type of violence I'm in
Allah's helpful most, innovative raps
That brought wealth through, shot out the belch too
We holdin', automatic semis with sick lines
Run up, body niggas, break down shoddy niggas
Styles so sharp, state of the art
Greater the mark, flyest creator sprayed layin' darts
Flowin' like water, "Apocalypse Now"
Gun out blaow, wow the shit's wild when you short us
Runnin' through parkin' lots, don't get caught
Let off, bark your shots, we outta here, off the blocks


It ain't all to the good, muh'fuckers hatin' in the hood
Gotta a hundred wolves waitin' in the woods
For the Clan's forthcomin'
I miss you in the game a court summons
And fugitives of rap caught runnin, y'all get locked up
E'rything was wack 'til we popped up
And got it on and poppin' like Orville Reddenbacher
Potnah, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
Wu-Tang got ya, like every ghetto got a Tasha
Request lines are now open, you see these MC's chokin'
And thinkin', "What's that SHIT they be smokin'?"
I'm so focused, simple chronic halitosis
Keep my shit funky when I spit this braggadocious
{*hach, spit*} Y'all niggas got some fuckin nerve
To critic what I write, that's my muh'fuckin word
Blah blah blah, like N'Sync
Kiss that ass bye bye bye knahmsayin'? I ain't playin'


Many shall come, few chose to stay exact
Track after track I'm fightin' for survival
Before me I see hills and mountains they sway
The words gotta move and the crowd's like the ocean
I walk water holdin' y'all suspended with the vocal
What's the total people that came to see the Gods?
I gave thought talent, construct my best poetry
Potentcy, high-level content
Side effect may cause a tec to eject, many places
All ages streets to cages, split faces
Shoutin' nuff love to the peeps from Miami
We live from Pulaski and spread glassy


Wu-Tang style




Interesting, interesting, interview, interview
Jazz, hip-hop, pull yaself, love yaself
Love yaself, we'll flair on y'all
Straight like that, ya heard?
No doubt, we'll make ya move, one time
Rodney Kendrick


Who'll be the victim?
I bend him, twist him, when I spark the 'ism
Mama gon' miss him, Bed-Stuy's in me, can't get it out par
Me in pull 'sage in the back of a shark bar
Whenever there's a mic, I'm there
Whenever the club starts spittin in the air
Everybody feelin me, "Scorp' you the man, son"
Girls say I'm handsome, got a new anthem
Break off with thumbs that write like me
Punish ya lungs to fight like me, how hype I be
Real MC's do real shit, lyrical shit
Rip my whole Bed-Stuy Click, blow clips
They came sour and rich, like fish and chips
If you don't fit then split, abandon ship
Punch you in ya lip, pop shit, I squeeze
Nigga Please, you won't believe how you gon' bleed


Extraordinary, rapability
Killa Bees, live in ya facility
You jazz cats are killin me
Who you think got the chemistry?
Extraordinary, rapability
Killa Bees, live in ya facility
You rap cats are killin me
Who you think got the chemistry?


Yo, those who try to judge me, they don't know me
Others try to teach me, but couldn't show me
The media, thought they distly, tried to play me
Rest tried to test me, but couldn't grade me
When I begin to bang this jazzy tune
The crowd react quickly, if not soon
I'm black and proud, I move the crowd
Yet I'm not raised in hell
My lyrics alone, rock the bells
Of those who say it's me they wanna scar
Hmm, that's like George Burns without a cigar
Some come in the game and project the hard image
But they can't never get past the line of scrI'mage
I'm on the defence with a strong sequence
You lack the knowledge to understand the pretence
From not playin it right, you got sacked
While I blitz the rhymes that were broken down in stacks
Therefore, the mic that was hyper than ya hand
Got stripped and ripped while it slipped from it's stand
Then what happened? You begin to cease to control it
You fumble, couldn't rumble, so then I stole it
How did you think you could make the first down?
If you were boxin, you wouldn't escape the first round




Made in God's image, with no gimmicks
Travel beyond limits, with Rodney Kendricks
Back hunch over keyboards like Igor
Leave my mind free to sour
The galaxies, cosmic alchemy
Spit words like a prince on his balcony
Touch you like the bullet that made Malcolm bleed
Red mahogany, it's like hard times and poverty
Jazz and hip-hop, state of the art
Razor sharp, it rip clubs apart
Revise slugs in the park, then the blunts'll spark
The party gets worse after dark
Words and melodies, enjoy the smell of weed
Cold faces while brothers roll Aces
Play the wall, it might be a ball
Word is bond when my favorite song comes on
Recitin words like they fightin words
When it's night, dim in the light like a verb
Too swift to be observed, I move crowds like herb
I hit opponents in they vital nerves
Lyrics, hard like spear tips
It goes dip until you feel it
Confess, who's the illest? Who's the realest?
Go tell ya whole village {*echoes*}





Gyg



When a man and woman make love in a bed or sofa
And then the sperm have a journey just to try to reach the ova
Then when it enters the cervix, the sperm start running
That's when the function starts as sexual reproduction

Now the function the male produces is testosterone
Which is a hormone like females produce estrogene and progesterone
And when the sperm finally reaches the ova and the journey's over
It becomes a zygote and waits 'till it's nine months older
As it waits in the placenta it begins to grow a nose,toes
Be careful though cause toxins can ruin the growth


Positive Energy Activates Constant Elevation (4x)

DNA, deciding to never agitate or detonate
Holding all of your fates but wait
It's the double helix, lifes remix

Deoxyribonucleic acid

Watson and Crick mastered
You're flabberghasted

DNA, the instructions for making a protein
Several amino acids one of them is named proline
46 chromosomes, pairs 23
DNA has a codon, sequence of it is 3

Some mistake chromosomes or common mistake
DNA copies itself we call it replicate

Each chromosomes has 100's or thousands of genes
Each gene codes for a particular protein

Each of the genes has a different fusion, some is fused to music others computers

Which is a hormone like females produce estrogene and progesterone
And when the sperm finally reaches the ova and the journey's over
It becomes a zygote and waits 'till it's nine months older




It's Wu motherfuckers, Wu-Tang motherfuckers
It's Wu motherfuckers, a Wu-Tang motherfuckers
It's Wu motherfuckers, a Wu-Tang motherfuckers
It's Wu


Reunited, double LP, world excited
Struck a match to the underground, industry ignited
From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth
Wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf
Scatting off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily
Tragically, that style deteriorate rapidly
Uncompleted missions, throwing your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up if you mastered addition
Where I come from, getting visuals is habitual
You're more safe walking on hot coals in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall, formed a mural
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it was plural
Rhyming while impaired, dart hit your garment
Pierced your internal streamlined compartments
Just consider the unparalleled advantage
Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage


Bitchass niggas counterfeit the funk
I smoke the bead of the skunk, tree top of the trunk
Moonshine drunken monk, your head get shrunk
Your treasure sunk, I be fucking bitches by the chunk
My name black, you worms wanna play in my dirt
Bitch stop, my Momma serve free lunch from the church
I cum like a thousand doves
Bitch you quiet at the bus, making no fuss, I gots tough love
Unglove the noose, watch a nigga transfuse
Dirty add to the fuse, heavy at the booze
I don't walk, I get carried
Gold and platinum Frisbees on my wall, looking properly
But comely, I U.F.O. you Wright Brothers
The Indian that sold Manhattan to the white man
My grandfather, stepped up and get knocked right the fuck out
Come to the cook-out, dirty bitch at the mouth
You scared, run around like a plane about to crash


Wu-Tang motherfuckers
Wu-Tang motherfuckers
Yeah and RZA


The Riddler, funny bone tickler, freak Caligula
Bigger dick sex enigma, pistil fertilize your stigma
Stinkbox order from Pink Dot
MCs get stuck on ink blots, AirSound plug to the sinkbox
Wu-Tang Incorp. take your brain on spacewarp
Talk strange like Bjrk, great hero Jim Thorpe
How can I put it, life is like video footage
Hard to edit, directors, that never understood it
Too impulsive, my deadly corrosive dosage
Attack when you least notice through explosive postage
I don't play, the rap souffle saut for the day
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig A Leg Leg Arm Head
Spread like plague, we drink Hennessy by the keg
I got the golden egg plus the goose
Eighty proof Absolut mixed with cranberry fruit juice
Ginseng boost, I got your neck in a noose
Keep my money wrinkled, the rap star twinkle killer instinct
Sixteen bar nickel sell more copies than Kinko
Grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us
And we return like Jesus when the whole world need us


Is it appetite for destruction?
Slap a murder rap on this production
I touch something, trust nothing
Iron Lung/Twisted Metal
I see 'em ducking my dart gun, busting from every angle
Worldwide total carnage, the sickest flow
That be codenamed Agent Orange, killing you slow
It's only right you pay homage
To those that's 'bout to blow like that shit up your nose
Solid as a rock when I strike target
Verbal be screaming on you like a drill sergeant
Herbals got me where I wanna be right now
Don't know the time
Check the hour on your sundial, watch me shine
Drunk off of cheap wine
Each line be on point when I speak mine
On behalf of my crew, SUUUUUUUUUUU, Enter the Wu
36 more deadly Chambers to take you through


It's Wu motherfuckers
Wu-Tang motherfuckers

 Oh yeahhhh, ahhh, aiyy yeahh yeahhhahh aiii
 And RZA...






Aiyo, Rockstars, bases and capers flying through cases
With placed bread, lead blowing through domes, scalped faces
Moving through towns, skama lit, nations bend stations
Dope fiend Asians, smoke cream vanquishes
The town is thirsty for work, blood hurting
Flash the curtain, open, I'm scoping, Hutch and his team
Clutching Dutches Backwoods, other shits working, not perfect
Flipping discussions, cussing all froze with slush, kid
Lacer had the drop, pass the Glock, Woosie uzi
The car hard bluesy with the pay me mean 'Bach
Cream shot, clean slot, one in his dome, four shock
He partially zoned, his dome fell on the rock
His face dazzle, niggas baffle, son, hit the floor, he traveled
Yo, to a new land, I cracked his cerebellum
Wide open, open the crowd up, he fouled up, black laid in the hall
For like forty-five to an hour, soaking


Sound of the smoking barrel, live like them older stars
Scrooge like a Christmas Carol, stemmed from a bloody love
Shot through the old apparel, no police to respond
Dropped off the Verrazano, washed up On Golden Pond
Just like a Shakespeare novel, more problems to dissolve
If this is destiny, that's how this world revolves


Aiyo, it's real, better pop your steel
Cop those wheels, shop those deals
Full time with the grind for a meal
Stay down low like O'Neal
Rain, hail, snow or shine, put time on the field
Police ride on my heels
Still big time, big dime, how you feel
I rhyme but the nine stay peel
I, zone on roam, floss with the chrome on chrome
Host on the corner store
S.I.N.Y. on my own, it gets foul, but I call it home
Live red bone give me dome, champagne toast to Tone
Roll a bone, a homegrown with Capone
Cause more rips to the o-zone, wanna ride with a nigga then hold on


The place was very smokey and cloudy, the full lousy
Music was emotional, people vibes was laid back and far from rowdy
She sit at the bar, holding a glass, sipping on a drink
Tears flowing like water from a sink, her eyes never blink
Her cigarette was burnt to the butt, her wrist was wearing a cut
Her facial expression was saying "now what"
Another drink was made, each and every time the bass was played
Bartender telling her to go, but then she only stayed
Riding on the borderline, between homicidal, suicidal
Just hours from the headlines, the story with the grim title
She questioned her reason for being here, but even with
Four kids at home alone, it still remains unclear
Opens up a bottle of prescribed drugs and grabs a mug
Down, every one of those pills, since she was feeling bugged
Kinda weak, she stumbled from her seat, but she will never return
I guess it must of been a, lesson to learn






Uh-huh, GZA, uh, RZA, uh


Listen, if ya'll can spit, we can spit, please get it together
Cuz anything you can do, I can do better
Your imagine material looks, hidin behind hooks
Raise the fear, no one, but self, who's shook?
Bring the plague like the revelations in the holy book
Who's spot youse took? Duke off the hook!
I'm from the land of the crook, life quick to end
Better known as the Brook, rather take than lend
There's a lot of wack records, but this ain't one of them
DJ's off the books, go 'head put the gun at them
All groupie M.C.'s, I'm bout to start stunnin' 'em
Don't matter what crew, every last one of 'em
It's gettin' crowded in here, some acts got to go
Let's start by eliminatin' groups that can't flow
I bet a mil' my deal, my career with no fear
That none of ya'll, duke, can touch what's over here


These rough cut metal tapes
Quick to break your label mates, won't hesitate
Negotiate your table stakes, you can't flow right
Or fuck with me on no night
Fuck the slow light, you need to get your show right


Yo Justice, how many M.C.'s must get pistol whipped?
Crack faces with bottles of Crys', hollow tips gobble lips
That's the penalty for poppin' that shit
Vanish in a colorless whip, bags of grip
Doo-rags and clips, tag the strip
You had the chance to advance, I'm sorry for the holes in
Your hip
Son, It's the way of the street merchant, live by the laws
Die by the rules
My gleam play the part of a fool
Now hear these jewels from a wise king, see what my eyes seen
Ten year supreme, the theme, we sizzle-line and triple CREAM
My grip'll off that digital bream, visual scene
Roll footage on your video screen
Globe patrol, Two On The Road, we never fold
Snub react, GZA mack eliminate tracks
Stimulate phat, Sunzini, nigga, gifted and black
Now watch me mack to the kingdom of rap


Give me a beat, nigga dealin' battles like a thief
Done killed more niggas than Jason in part 3
Stay Wu, own the graveyard and this label
Dum dums, that battle 12 O'Clock, now it's able
So what, looked up and made the bitches clap
That was because my style's clothes, not the raps
Ain't that shit, props for the clothing
Should of brought a mirror, cuz lyric wasn't rollin'
My rhymes is all that and yours ain't shit
And at a party, your bitch takin' crazy flicks of me
She said I was nigga celebrity
But I'm from the slums, with the bums drinkin' Hennesey
Take a sip of some Jamaican rum
Put fire to my lung, tongue, teeth and gums
When it comes out my mouth, shit's hot and it burns
Make fools out of bitches like I'm Howard Stern








Huh, after all these years, what you said was true
The Shaolin and the Wu-Tang is very dangerous

Hahahahahah


It's the ODB kid, once again coming through your area
And I'm going to tell you one time, you gon' love this


I had to get the money, said it wasn't a choice
Die Hard's on the bars, Ladies lovin' the voice
Morphine flow, numbing your joints
Bomb a nigga like he number 81 from Detroit
Zombie life, World War Z
Antidote to your virus, your highness, the world on me
Capital G, cool as the dude from Dos Equis
So deadly, I don't make it rain, I snow heavy
Sick lane, Nic Cage how I ride with fire
Forever with bars, sort of like a lifer
With the son of anarchy, I be breaking bad
Walking dead, day dreaming of making a band
Dancing with the stars, Americans idol me
The mentalist with the Big Bang Theory


Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


The most duplicated, anticipated, validated
Urban legends in the books with the ones who made it
Highly celebrated, everything was work related
Current top 40 got the Wu deep in all their business
20 years Killa Bees, yeah, we hold the pennant
Monumental stance on the cover with my co-defendants
Drop her sentence, in remembrance
Construct these jewels so they can live through my descendants


Youngun, I can see your draws, pull your pants up
Can't even call yourself a man until you man up
And if you call yourself a fan you need to stand up
This ain't a party, it's a jux, keep your hands up
And I don't care who runs the city when the summer come
Your summer's done, Wu forever, and we're still number one


Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


Picture a nigga on the strip getting rich off the drug shit
Putting other niggas on, teaching em thug shit
Then they want stick 'em up, then they get slugs quick
Hood-type niggas always living that crime life
Jealous-ass grimy niggas seeing the limelight
Slimy old nigga like fucking your mans wife
Fool shouldn't use the word brother, he man dyke


Yo, I spin my web all across New York
Get it out in all types of ice, there's a sport
One chain, two chain, three chain, four
Niggas mouth's drop like the leaves in the fall
Tone got that WBC
I take off heavy in air balloons and land in the Fiji's
That's my bird and that's my word
You faggots keep fucking around and get curbed
(I came to town)


Forms circles like the rings of Saturn
Dust rocks and ice in a particular pattern
Then this fascinating picture has emerged from surface
A wonder of the young world with an urgent purpose
A wild fire engulfing every home
It's history chiseled and carved in every stone
A workshop where skills are learned
Handcrafted and drafted, written works the main concern
Urban center provided with a social structure
And a curious culture full of superconductors
Each stain is part of a scene with
Intricate geometric raps on a larger screen
Spell bounding, marvelous and it's surrounding
Viewpoints remain the same, it's all astounding
A place where the forgotten art is so powerful
A striking image is something that's so valuable


This one's the blackout! Three-fifty-seven to your mouth!


GZA, this is called Ruckus In B Minor
Rae, all those bad times is behind us
Ghost, put that mask on to remind us
Method Man, let 'em know who's New York's finest


Youngun, I can see your draws, pull your pants up
Can't even call yourself a man until you man up
And if you call yourself a fan you need to stand up
This ain't a party, it's a jux, keep your hands up
And I don't care who runs the city when the summer come
Your summer's done, Wu forever, and we're still number one


Still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


Now I'mma let all you motherfuckers know
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga
I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker!


My lines is like Peruvian coke, go ahead and try one
My recipe is A1 remarkable with my mixture
Rainman mathematician, this city slicker
The finest threads cover my frame, the cloths of royalty
Strive with an army of winners and no pretenders
(*One*) We live free and achieve more
But first we gotta win with no stalemate
The all eye seeing is victorious biz to the sound man


Armored trucks, tanks are bulletproof, been the truth
Loot the track, clear the booth, my thought ready, aim, shoot
My knowledge one twenty proof, let's tear the roof off
Let's spray, M-A-S-T-A
King I Love-Love club, pack stadium rock
I hold the mic snug, split a slug
Black ninja, mask and gloves


Still number one, still number one





Visual, visual, JB
Yo, Ye, what up? Raekwon


You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened I was floating, you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dining in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, patent leather
Playing the field, trying to outslick Baretta


You see, my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going? That's what nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love


I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool, tryna be cool, what you expect me to do?
I'm just tryna find, find, find this sweet love of mine


I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love


Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said "Yo what's your occupation, crazy rhyming?"
Listen to Wu-Tang, trying suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon
Stunting in a high top Louis', shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
Next show they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rocking like this 16 years old
The hard drums and the Wally's something that caught me
I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rocking the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top, old school bumping to Cash Rules
No question we the reason why the summer's blazing
Then say, "You looking good fly coloured Asian"
Raw I give it to you, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia
Until she caught me getting numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love, sweet love of mine




Why can't I find you, love of mine?
When you're standing in front of my face
Oh why, I must be blind
How did I let you get away?


Leave it up to the most high, sitting in a ghost fly
Chilling with two of my brothers
We both live on deck grabbing 'em on set
This is how we roll in the business, she a go I'mma go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month baby girl, just call me up
Waking up resting in cold sweats
Thinking of this bitch, the videotapes, even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost, I know I'm going crazy, I can't floss
Me, my lady left my homies it's all baloney
Just like rocking the old Pony's
So when I'm chilling, I'm just lost no more feeling
I need my honey in my life get that feel me
Take your time, readjust and ya you shine
My runaway love didn't mind, come on






Oh, oh, oh, come on, come on, come on
Mutha what? Muthafucka
That's right, all day, all night
Come on, get down, yes y'all and
To the right beat and you can even dance
Or, just have a seating, seating
Yo, yo, yo


What it was, what it is, it's like I got a pistol
To my head, can I live? You never should of left Tical for dead
Never that, be careful what you wish for
Today's your day to get yours
Blowin' up the spot from the sixth floor, bent off
Come and get your on smoke on, fish funk to choke on
Go 'head, blaze a pound of that bullshit we both on
Take it the 'source', 'hip hop quotable', of course
I'm pullin' out my 'roots', to breathe in my 'black thought'
Let's be honest, I break a spirit, if she break a promise
They act just like they momma's, now what that got to do
With the price of rice in China
Or why these gold miners raise the price on they vagina
Now frankly, I'm official, New York Yankee
You can blame the radio stations that's trynna yank me
And jerk the Jabber Jaw shark bitten flow
Go 'head, test the water, my friend, stick in your toe


Rush, the colisseum, rush, the dance floor
Rush, the limosine, rush, don't let go
And jerk the Jabber Jaw shark bitten flow
Go 'head, test the water, my friend, stick in your toe
Whoa-ho-ho, let me like, solo with the flow
Whoa-ho-ho, promoter better pay me at the door
Whoa-ho-ho, what the fuck y'all think I'm flowin' for
If I move to quick, oh, you just don't know


The sound echoed through the neighborhood and vibrate
Circulate eruptions throughout the tri-state
The wise they attract to it, cuz it's magnetic
Those slow kids, stuck on the block, they don't get it
But, they don't wanna set it, track on immedietly
Quick fast, clock tick to the blast machine
The bugged out, they scatter when the lights on
We raid those local spots, til we turn the mics on
Rollin' with the talent, the beats, and rap verse
The crowd get excited, with the heat and clap first
Must of had a hot hand to go in his waist band
Set he had to lick a shot for a top notch Clan
Multiple swordsmen, blade sharp
Rip through your heart, M.C.'s, want no part
For any type of conflict, or nonsense, then we respond quick
It get thick, The Problem, goes beyond sick




Let the record show, never test my flow
Never tested positive for blow
Got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffin'
Soon as muthafuckas get dough, they act different
But not Nixon, let the pot call the kettle black, but not in my kitchen
And y'all fixin', to be on milk cartoons missing
In the Double XL, Supreme Clientele
Since then I have no birthday, my sign's not for sale
If I had a dollar, for every time M.C.'s tried to holla
Brag about dough, and pop they collar
I'd probably be a zillionaire, like, 'fuck rapping and rappers'
Cut the drama, we don't like the way y'all actin'
Eat, drink and smoke Mary, Mr. Meth's rated X
By any means necessary (come on)
It ain't easy being greasy, in the main event now
Catch me on your Pay-Per-View TV






Yo, yo, yo, what up kid? Yo, these niggas is back, son
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) I'm telling you, spit that, done it nigga
Yeah... yeah... yeah, yeah, I seen it like a Zenith, man
You hear me man? Word up, man, ya'll know what it is
It's on again, man, for real, Top Gun, what what


Aiyo, we came through thumping like elephants
The new Range is super-charged, I remains intelligent
Back to the formula, lord, hard grammar
This is God school, make sure the lobby ain't jammed up
Excalibur swords, T-Rexes, bibles of rhymes
We in the lunchroom, weed and veggies for breakfast
Polo campus, sicker lances, the crisp
Hundred dollar kick niggas, that be showing you hand steps
Back to the dormatory, where niggas
Broke my forearm and index finger, now you write glory
True holding my flag, it's all engraved in my blade
So when I wave it, you gon' say Rae mad
Now it's 28 Days Later, now Wu's up, do something, you can't
It's blood in my eye, I might get amped
To rip something down, the billboard holders is back
So when you see me, you gon' say he gets down


From darkness to DNA, I move with my brother
And we resonate, energy that shifts in colors
Bringing MC's punishment, then I'm done with it
The meter leave way on the fast break, I run with it
It was not a hobby, but a childhood passion
That had started in the lobby and was quicky fashioned
Every line to line, bar for bar is clockwork
Hazardous and powerful enough to have your block hurt
Check the total amount of MC's inflicted
With torture, from moving with work that's restricted
We criticize producers til they joints are right
Then acupuncture the track with pinpoints of light
Hitting them from well conceiled firing positions
With explosiveness that'll make the deaf listen
Drastic, pyroclastic, connected with the same old
Down the dangerous slopes of an active volcano


Blitz like the Green Bay Packers, sack like the linebackers
Hang with niggas, like redneck crackers
Strangle cold bottles of Beck's, like a vexed German
Duck low behind the car, my tech burning
Neck burning, from eight karats of sunlight
Absorbed, in the grill, Big Pun like
Lord of the Wu-Tang sword, know what that means?
Like J.R. Tolkien, it's the Lord of the Rings
This is my man, Chef, auto, like Grand Theft Auto
The 18th letter, followed by the mark of Zorro
Plus A, not for apple, but I pack an apple
Shorty try to buck back, and knock me off the saddle
Caramel, pecan, sundae, Pregline
Plump breasts, was filled with saline
Her big booty cousin, nasty Nadine
Get you on the floor, whore tried to double team


Is he still that nucca? Is he in the hood like that?
Is he really strapped? Will he really split yo' shit?
I thought you said he rap? Pull up in the yard, ten sets
He ain't flexing, microphone ripping, heat holding
Who testing? Rope-a-dope his black lotus
Can't quote this, chat with the sword tongue
Duck when the axe is swinging, wild Apache drum
Crazy Horse kicking his thoughts, he won't quit
Can't tell 'em nothing, he grown, give the man room
Space was demanded, beat banging through the speaker
Voice, heat seek missle, guided at the listener
Swing to the gospel, catch up and wet at the brothel
Unstoppable, direction of my flow, optional
To the ear, depending on the current of air, the crowd's in



Teachers College, Columbia University
12/12/12

Thank you for your introduction, Chris. Thank you David, Helen, Daniel, Ridhi and John for coming to support our effort. And thank you everyone, for coming. My name is GZA from The Wu Tang Clan. It is an honor to be here at Teachers College to discuss Science Genius. Particularly on 12/12/12. Since 2001, I have done something to commemorate the triple number date. But I can't think of a better way to culminate the tradition than to be here with all of you to talk about this program

Most people associate Wu Tang with Staten Island but I was born in Brooklyn and lived in almost every borough by the time I was ten. I left high school in the tenth grade and it's one of my greatest regrets in life. I am here--not as a teacher, nor expert, nor genius--but rather as a science enthusiast who wants to inspire New York City public high school students to get excited about biology, chemistry and physics. I wish there had been a more compelling way to captivate my imagination about science when I was in school

The interaction between matter and energy has always aroused my interest and curiosity. When I was around the age of six, I can remember playing with two pieces of steel or metal. One of them was magnetic and the other was not. The piece with the magnetic force attracted the piece without. I flipped them in opposite directions and they repelled each other as if some force was pushing them apart. I found this fascinating. Years later I would come to learn that every single atom in your body is from the core of a star that was created billions of years ago. From the skin cells to the iron in your blood, the carbon in your genes to the gold on your finger, all created over thirteen billion years ago. Not only is that an interesting connection, it is also a great one. This is a very unique bond that makes you look at life in a whole different perspective and see beauty in everything

In the last year I was able to meet with some of the top scientists in the world, including those whom you've just heard from. At MIT I met with Biological Oceanographer Penny Chisholm, Geneticist Eric Lander, the founding director of The Broad Institute at MIT. At Cornell University I met Alexander Gaeta and last but not least, Neil DeGrasse Tyson. It was incredibly humbling and inspiring to meet with these people but I do believe that the future Penny's, David's and Neil's are the young students that are in the NYC public schools. Not only was it interesting to see how dedicated and committed they were to their work, it was also interesting to see how excited they were to hear that I was incorporating science into my works

My next album will be entitled DARK MATTER, which is scheduled to be released in 2013. It will be a Cosmic journey through the universe. A galactic adventure. A Personal look into a dark and distant past. Matter that influences the evolution of the universe gravitationally. The goal is to influence the evolution of hip hop and schooling

Now that hip hop has become the single most dominant cultural touchstone in the lives of most youth, Chris Edmin, Rapgenius and I have come together to sponsor Science Genius. We chose hip hop as an art form to educate the listeners about scientific topics. As I said before I am not a science teacher. I go into classrooms as an artist and provide a model for students to communicate the information learned from their science teachers

My role in the process is to encourage students to compose creative writing, not just through rhyme, but through a metaphoric narrative approach to animate the science concepts so that the material can be digested by students in a interdisciplinary way. The rhymes are a starting point to introduce this technique of seeing science in a new way, a new context. I challenge students to not be too literal and write compelling stories. Make it "half short, twice strong." Light as an atom to where it doesn't trouble the soul of the listener, but heavy as a neutron star to where it's mind boggling

One thing that I try to impart in the classroom is that the rhyme must be clear, eloquent, witty and clever. I challenge students to make sense of complex information while maintaining the high standards of serious lyricism

I believe that science is important because it helps you gain a deeper understanding of yourself and your surroundings. Knowledge of one's environment specifically through science can increase self-awareness, confidence, and critical thinking skills that can translate outside of the classroom. I just heard on a commercial that Children need to learn science in order to succeed in this global society. Hip hop is important because using a vehicle the students are already familiar with decreases their resistance to the technical jargon in science, giving them more control over their communication while incorporating science concepts into their everyday vocabularies

Thank you again for coming to show your support




If we talkin' rocks then let's talk metallic
Metamorphic, cementation, and compaction
If we talkin rocks then lets talk organic
Sandstone, coal, and that inorganic
Bioclast, foliation, and that granite
I can tell you something bout an aphinatic
It's very rare plus i heard it's so volcanic
To tell the truth i've never been a rock fanatic


I'm talkin' bout them rocks you can't imagine
That metamorphic rock with the streak sctratchin'
The way it be erodin' you would think its magic
And this a easy A cause they got me rappin
And shout out to miss ware cause she made it happen
And when I'm done with this it be a science anthem
That luster on the rock a have your eyes glancin'
When it turn to cleavage it be so fancy
That layered up appearance yea that foliation
But when they glued together then that's cementation
Composition, solidification
There's a whole rock variation






I despise your killing and raping
You're despicable (Are you my judge?)
It's just you should be punished
I'm gonna chop off your arm, so are you ready?


Check these high hats sling tings moving through the rubbish
Party robust, rec room style for you brothers
Time's ticking, erupt misconduct
Entering one funk before the drum dry up
Dial, style, jab vocab slow
Alphabet run, construction voice might blow
Tap dance swelling Hemingway novel model
For a breather, dirty reefer hide your bottle
Cut down, come with something that's round and profound
Blood brothers, people of colors, we get down
Watch this fly, force feed things being said
Nine Diagram acid black evil red leathers
Mic half a dangle, serious a man
My mic clapper death wish, everlasting plan
Heavenly God body, know me as the cleaner
Night champion, old villain style seamer
Kiss a spider, Seagal saga why bother
Godfather talk drama, fly swatters


Number two, Chao San Poi


This Wu shit be hard to kill and full blown
Rhymes filtered through the net before words hit the chrome
Pro tools editing tracks that's rough
Cause a jam without a live MC isn't enough
So we attack this and grab all within reach
Throw a scrap back to niggas,perfect your own speech
Shit is copper, it ain't worth the mic stands
Used by backup singers in Atlantic City bands
Niggas look on and get hooked on this mic line
Reeled in and shipped through the pipeline
LPs delivered with style and potential
Niggas flowing smoothly in a sequential
Order, revealing hidden tape recorders
Stashed inside pockets of those who lack aura


Twist the DAC up, them niggas with math is back up
Watch he act up, fifty-two block track we slap up
Playground manoeuvre, jet to Vancouver like this
Two Kahluas one chick, she's German Luger
Get the shit on, light a fresh pack, bust it open
With the seal on Dunn, deal on this, with the real on
Necks rocky ring, call it the Decatur
Slang soufleer home decorater, player
Mic immigrants, nine of us formed resemblance
Somethin flashy, God dead-armed is nasty
Peep the ornaments enough to make Shorty-Wop stare at me yo
He killed the God might as well throw a chair at me


Yo MC's wonder what's Hip Hop thunder
Tell you the truth it's just one nation under a groove
Gettin down for the funk of it
Like Fred Sanford in the biz...
Yo inhale this paraphernalia, a Wu memorabilia
Melba the fortune teller, tried to tell ya
Bout the group recruit we scoop up CREAM like Breyer's
Then spread across the globe like telephone wires
Thirty-six assorted, Shaolin imported
Chambers been recorded, you're fuckin with the loops
Time for royalty audit
Fabulous establishment metabolism, Blackfoot Indian
Cherokee started out smaller than amphibian
Then grew to a physical body with five meridians
As the pendulum swings closer to the millenium
Two thousand, wickedness is spread amongst my citizen
I got a muscle the industrial to make a hustle
And politic with Lyor and Russell
When niggas is still rushin we'll brush you


He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives


Thoughts are contained in the trenches of the brain
Ignite, blowing the mic to Arabian heights
As I recite this medley, niggas couldn't fuck with the
Deadly ground I hold down
Classical gangland style, shots hit the ceiling
Panic and confusion echoes through the building
Continuing to build, I strive for perfection
Driven by the will to live, Glocks I hold
Shots I give, while searchers of rescue teams
Look for means of survival and who's liable
For this harrowing experience
You scream for the extreme, fiend for the cap
And proceeds of the Wu-Tang Academy
To fuck up your anatomy with assault and battery


Number two, Chao San Poi
Number two, Chao San Poi
He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives
Number one, Yen Chang Wa
He's an adulterer, don't trust him
Number two, Chao San Poi
Number two, Chao San Poi
He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives
I despise your killing, and raping
You're... despicable
Are you, my judge?
It's just... you should be punished
I'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?
I despise your killing, and raping
You're... despicable
Are you, my judge?
It's just... you should be punished
I'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?



RodiMiS
Biting facts of being
Woman mans favorite being
Hate it or Love it
Her voice on percussion
No other, Doo Wop, Stop understand my women
Showing realism
Miseducation
Young'n can't process the sayin'
So I'mma delay it
Moved on to another basic, reality
Oh Zion, Yea I protect that like The Matrix
I say this
Move on forward as I take it
Take maybe um, oh Doo Wop
Hell yea, You got that right there
Have to understand I'm prepared
Aye yo, Dawg, this is a looped intro
So, I hope you know, that I gotta go but um
Oh there it goes



GeniuZ
Femme Fatale, high pitch voice possible
Green light a way to run away from tracks unstoppable
Lock and load when I drop a flow
Black Holes for these void rappers like space or dominoes
When Miseducation still made my honor roll
Model pot of gold
Model everything is everything so
Eyes of windows to the soul
And the hills have eyes
She got open windows
(Ugh) Life lessons to a surrogate Zion
Picture life as a Nikon
Turned to an icon
I tell her right on
Her music says right on?
If I could do it, You could be the one I shine on
So, ready or not, here I come fame I'll find you
Switching animated channels
Tryna find the right tunes
Way too, Good to be true
Since I can't take my eyes off of you
(it's like ugh)




Special technique, fuck that
Special technique of shadowboxing, Goddamn
The GZA, Goddamn
The GZA, Goddamn, pledge allegiance to the Hip Hop
Method, Goddamn, I pledge allegiance to the Hip Hop
Maximillion, Maximillion
Johnny Blaze
I pledge allegiance to the Hip Hop
Johnny Blaze
Maximillion, Maximillion


I breaks it down to the bone gristle
Ill speaking scud missile heat seeking
Johnny Blazing, nightmares like Wes Craven
Niggas gunning, my third eye seen it coming before it happen
You know about them fucking Staten kids, they smashing
Everything huh in any shape form or fashion
Now everybody talking bout they blasting, hmmm
Is you busting steel or is you flashing? Hmmm
Talking out your asshole
You should have learnt about the flow and peasy afro
Ticallion stallion, chinky-eye and snot-nosed
From my naps to the bunion on my big toe
I keeps it moving, know just what the fuck I'm doing
Rap insomniac, fiend to catch a nigga snoozing
Slip the cardiac arrest me, exorcist Hip Hop possess me
Crunch a nigga like a Nestle, you know my STEEZ
Burning to the third degree, sneaky ass alley cat top pedigree
The head toucher, industry party bum rusher
You dont like it? Dick up in you, fuck ya!


Allow me to demonstrate
That's right, you corny-ass
The skill of Shaolin, rap motherfuckers
The special technique, better go back and check
Of shadowboxing, your fucking stacks
Shadowboxing, cause your naps ain't nappy enough
And your beats ain't rugged enough, bitch


I slayed MCs back in the rec room era
My style broke motherfucking backs like Ken Patera
Most rap niggas came loud but unheard
Once I pulled out, round 'em off to the nearest third
Check these non-visual niggas, with tapes and a portrait
Flood the seminar trying to orbit this corporate
Industry, but what them niggas can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect Ya Neck, my sword still remain imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year round from June to June
While niggas bite immediately if not soon
Set the lynching and form the execution date
As this two thousand beyond slang suffocate
Amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
Cause RZA to charge niggas twenty Gs a session


When my mind start to clicking and the strategy
Is mastered the plot thickens
This be that Wu shit
I don't give a cotton-pickin' FUCK
About a brother tryna size a nigga up, I hold my own
Hard-hat protect your dome
Look at Mama baby boy acting like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa bee, that be holding down his honeycomb, lounging son
Wu brother number one, protect your neck
Flying guillotines here they come, bloody bastards
Hard times and killer tactics, spitting words plus
Semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle, hit the clutch
Shift the gear now, full throttle, time to bungee
To the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack and spitting lunghies
At a wack nigga dat, don't understand the fact
When it come to RZA tracks I don't know how to act
Real rap from the Stat, Killa Hill Projects
How to be exact, break it down
All in together now
Things are getting good looking better now
...And some other shit


Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
Sha-shadowboxing, the special technique of shadowboxing




He's running in a short race, shoelace untied
Head down, facial expression he can't hide
Kid with no direction, seems confused
A victim who spent years, being abused
His moms a drug addict, she has a bug habit
Was a Seventh Day Adventist who celebrated the Sabbath
But she back slid, or that's what the crack did
She used to shoot up, under her sleeves, the track hid
A long time ago, the father left the picture
And as time went on, he was erased from the scripture
The son, he don't have much to treasure
And these kids that be getting on him, they do it for pleasure
Demons are gradually growing inside him
Way before he ever knew the courts would divide him
A wall around himself had became a shell
Was a whole new person, by the time the bricks fell


It's a short race, duck the court dates
The pork gave chase, we had to walk straight
You know the forte, nigga it's a portrait
Or should I say a poor trait
You want to store very short cake
Estate, behind the gate
N.Y. State, why wait?
You trying to get paid by the lake
In each state, and do the shit at high pace


Under the dirt, there was nothing left but bones
A lot of tall grass around his tombstone
His mother left alone, her heart felt sorrow
No time to play with the precious time we borrow
They live next door, but he was worlds away
In reality, but such a high price to pay
He was easy to recognize from his dress code
Nothing but a firework about to explode
A short fuse, who was bound to lose in the struggle
His grandparents went through a great deal of trouble
To keep him out of jail, they even put they house on sale
To post bail, but the kid still failed
I remember when he called collect from behind bars
Suffering from two injuries and nine scars
He said he'd give anything to be out the pen
But it would be his permanent home until the end




Wait, I got to get mines
With a side of French fries, not kid sized
Sixes fives, I give off a pimp's vibe
Is it the vines? Watch like a sitcom
Throwing rocks with my pitching arm
More bricks than when the Knicks is on, I'm sitting on
Shitting on your boss, been written off
Shots I'm licking off, the top like a different source
Ripping this raw like a kitchen chore
That's a block not chicken broth
Hold the pot with your mittens on
Dicks kicking in the door, and went to pick me off like a lintball
Jumped out the fifth floor it's a pit fall
When I hit the lawn, shit it fell like a jigsaw
Rather get hit at the board, then to get tossed
Went to court, got shipped off like a brick of soft






Yeah, six o'clock in the morning
That's right, you gotta get your darts right
Spray ya'll niggas on some marksman shit]


I got rid of the grays
Took my hat off and the crowd went crazy
Bitches threw their panties, the sound man was fannin' me
The whole place was standin', G
What they chant, we was family
Jumped in the crowd and I swam the sea
Threw me to the back, surprise, I still had my chains on me
Dana Dane, front row bitches, I bang all three
Say, yo, Math, fuck it, throw on Jim Browski
Versace, banana color robes and my socks be
Them Billie Jean shits and they real rocky
The fans can't knock me
I bench Coliseums while Genius spot me
Plus I'm cocky, bitch


Once I, took off the hoodie, revealed the face
Cop patrol couldn't control the place
I got groupies backstage, lined up at the gate
The signs up, yellin', "We love your tape!"
I'm sorry I took so long, didn't mean to make ya'll wait
But good things take time to create
You can find me, in your studio
Half baked, eatin' ganja cake
Tryin' to make my next release date
With Ghost, Street, GZA, great minds relate
You know a brother bond is hard to break
When we perform we cause the Earth to shake
Ain't nuthin' change, it's still those same niggas you love to hate
GZA...


I set examples over amplified samples
That's scratched in the club, ducks begin to trample
On those who fell victim, body loss they souls
These beats when I picked 'em
Jones played the role, soldiers, brave and bold
RZA paid the roll, GZA buries the scrolls
Then months later it was, then years later it was
Written on loose leaf, that old formula
That was stolen by new thieves
The journalist watched it, critics couldn't knock it
A piece of history that they carried in their pocket
With the time factor, speed was the order of the day
What a delay, they were able to, what he would say
Why waste the slot time, of the ridiculous rhyme
That's only excused by a generous mind
I kept 'em stored in the shelters like the goods in cans
'Til I turned rap fields into harvested lands




One, two, one, two, the High Chief
Yeah... yo... so alone... baby


I'm just lookin' out of the window
Watchin' the gunshots blow-ow
Thinkin' how we all was turnin' out
Keepin' my head above water
Got to make a weight when I can (cuz I can)
Temporary lay off, cop pay offs, daily rip offs
Informer tip off, clips lick off
The judge got hit off, boss got knocked off
Worker made a come off, cash got dropped off
Buildings got burnt out, sisters got turned out
Work out in the yard up North, tryin' to burst out
Pissy elevators, dirty cop favors
Tongues hiding razors, minors turn majors
Wave the bigger tools, shoot out inside the school yard
The game ain't' changed, niggas done made their own rules
They buildin' plans, they pull a million dollar scam
Watch for taped conversations, Jakes and dollar bands
The black market, labelled the movin' target
Dwellin' in the heartless projects
Evil eyes walkin', the BBS rims flossin'
The beat walk in, harassin' the street walkin'
They keep talkin', like the Rebel might slow up
They set me up to go up, the witness din't show up


Look out in drug stores (but I'm slippin') bare approach the look out
Be off the block by ten, the kite was sent
Then all those who dare to oppose, were sent back
Chained to the train track, protect ya jaw
These silverback niggas eat their oatmeal raw
Cee Allah sawed the shotti, 'Preme went down for a body
He killed Poppy, dusted in the lobby, toxy off shocky
Cops be harassin' tryin' to stop cashin'
The episodes pass, I flash back to guns
And crack stashed in grass, you movin' savage
Please warn him of his ways and actions
Before I blast him
Then the homicide was justified when I arrive
Black tints on the glass with the stockin' cap mask
It's all official, steel pistol style whip you, to the gristle
While my team be stompin' you out after the whistle


I went from the slums of Hell to paradise in Heaven
From a slingshot to a wall of Mac-11's
I drank with the Devil and ate with the Reverend
We talked numbers and I told 'em, that mine was 7
The total amount of hits, behind the collapsed building
That had exploded in a frenzy of killings
Bodies lay near tons of twisted metal
Of a structure and atomic force, it leveled
From the tale of the tape, the product failed in comparison
The weight, the height, the reach, was not a year within
Sight, the significant, difference was the ammo
Wrecking y'all individuals in the nano
Second by second, heat blazed through the night
Leaving a dazzling array of neon lights
The primary reason of mission for them spitting
The firing kept hitting, them ducks that kept sitting
But the informants x-rays gave off electrons
Within a few next days, entire sets gone
Prenticle precisions used to remove the eyelids
Those responsible for my brothers with high bids
Life in the hood is an award winning film
Lived out by savages who can't escape the realm
A place where the young meet and greet with guns
In the park they interrupt the pure innocent fun

When I'm locked down I use Timbs as my shower slippers
I'm in the background mingling with the powder flippers
In the basement, hard-body power lifters
I crush sour in the sifter, see how I lift her
Universal God I stay scientific
The kid with the Golden Arms, Iron Fisted
Stay Asiatic, so cinematic
Noise in the attic, bang out with them automatics
It's hood politics that bring the hunger back
I'm straight chopping wood, call me the lumberjack
Check the catalog put out a hundred packs
Watch for drug sniffing dogs they coming from the back
I'm straight thunder clap the funky drummer's back
It's pure Dopium, give em a heart attack
I stay stacking plaques like ancient artifacts
Joe Namath in the game I'm the quarterback


Eight balls of coke, blunt to the greenery
Pounds in the trunk get you a concrete scenery
Handmade ox'll get you dumped in the mess hall
Snitch niggas run to C.O.s to confess all
This is street knowledge, knowledge I school college
Like a speech from the GZA, sharp like the RZA
Don't run with a scissor, nigga the truth is the
Truth, now I'mma drop a few jewels in the booth
Used to boot crack, stuff em inside a tennis ball
Ans throw it when they rushing the block, trust no cops
Driving around with two mitts in my socks
Cooked coke gon' get you in more trouble than money
Don't crawl through dust juice the pigs is hungry
You think they ain't watching
They watching while you uptown copping
Back home while you're cooking and chopping
They scheming on the block waiting to get it popping


He had a sword and an axe with cuts
Under a road that was woven from silver and gold, waxed it up
His army was so great in quantity
His crops and livestock boost the economy
Many would travel by boat to see him
His image adorned most schools and coliseums
A merchant, hustle those silk and velvets
Portrait illuminated when the torch was well-lit
Picture so beautifully painted that
One thought it would breathe or move cause it would leave a mood
Or energy, you see his wife practiced Yoga
Made herbal enhancers that had saved the soldiers
Guard the treasures in the chambers, halls and vaults
Well-prepared for all assaults
Heavy guarded village
Armed with the sharpest weapons designed to pierce and cause blood spillage


From a young teen, a murder team, inspired by crime
See Allah Just granted permission for my position
Sit down, write rhymes, escaping this repetitive cycle
Slinging dimes, losing time, doing hard time
Teaching y'all mathematically, come see
The epitomy of what you wanna be - emcee
My semi-auto gun mandatory at the sound clash
The mic touched, dance mashed up, pounds of the best
Green glass bottles of don, I sip the liquor slow
Flow so devastating when I go solo
Even when I'm dolo, pretty gun I'm holding
Head swollen off the solid gold soul
Iron Mic pole beat your face like you stole something, trust me
Living life royalty, all wise and healthy
Welcome to the best of me, from knowledge to infinity
Never stopping my projectory, I'm galactic


Yo, peace to all of the gods and all of the earths
We been building like this ever since the first day of birth
The more I start to build, the better I feel
Keep ignorant niggas from me, use dummies for shield
You're not Godbody son, you're just garbage and real snotty
Cherry head gaylord still stuck in the lobby
This the first Now Born, son I'm blessed with mad lessons
Conquered crazy devils, my mind is a weapon
You can't fast with me and avoid the swine
You degenerate emcee, I'm the best of mankind
Allahu Akbar straight jewels and real stars
I'm down with the RZA, got help for the Widow's Son
Pop off on you, you ain't nothing to me - DUN DUN
Original Tyzeem, Holy water, Visine
Designated wordplay, God respect my deen
Shine on little stars and respect the Queen


New York Giant, call me Deck Umenyiora
Fresh with the water connect, two and a quarter
Deal with the dealer, don't trust the transporter
My job is done once I get it to the border
Perico, coke game is kilos of cocaine
Hypodermic needle to the groove, I dose veins
Overdoser, you know the product is raw right
Lines take you there like I wrote it with off-white
Got him bent up, hands looking like a tin cup
Sorry no consignment, get your ends up
Move from the gate now, he on his way straight to Jake now
I'm on the hush with my weight loud
Got the shakes now, how they want it bad
Five or six heads chipping in for a bag
I got the works like a burger deluxe
Get your fix while I'm serving it up, word to us



You no longer have to stand in front of me to feel my presence, to reach out and touch me
To offer not only words of support but a comforting hand
Live my experiences from one thousand miles away
Feel sand pour out of your hands on the beach in Hawai'i from a subway station in New York
Share my pain, my joy, my triumphs, and failures
You don't have to be there to be here
The Seven Senses advanced cellular phone network will connect you in every way: verbally, mentally, spiritually and physically



Today's feature story:
The New York Police Department now has the authority to enforce a shoot to kill policy, that will allow officers to utilize the probable cause statement previously applied to not so random searches.

Protestors are in the middle of organizing an emergency rally to overturn this decision. Our investigative reporters are on the scene to bring you new developments as they occur...

His autobiography had came to an end
With the final chapter written in blood upon a skin
From snakes, that was dirty as rodents
Therefore to a starving one, the call for hunger is potent
Some kids at a young age, their skull is fractured
Their mind store the sickest images ever captured
They draw pistols to resolve issues
To give 'em a sense of closure to expose the brain tissue
The shells was evidence of a violent event
That left a young dealer bent from a hundred rounds spent
The lifestyle is a thousand miles from a minister
A small con game with something far more sinister
Peer pressure got him moving faster
A paradise of mutation open the gates of disaster
And murder is not the only cold blooded crime
You got fiends that'll torture the teens to get a dime


Empty ya pockets nigga and don't move
You react any other way and they'll prove
'Cuz they ain't got a problem with laying ya ass out
Or putting in work so you can see what it's about
Money got the flow, nigga and don't stop
Whether drugs or a ho, nigga, stay on top
'Cuz they don't have a problem with running up in ya house
And burning it to the ground after the shit is doused


I told him to save his breathe
'Cuz he hovered on the brink of death
He wasn't living right before he left
His life took an unexpected turn
For those who walked that path, here's a lesson to learn
Coming from a nesting ground of those on the growl
In a state of darkness, menacing on the prowl
Local rivals and known competitors
Who try to stay clear from the spying eyes of predators
On the hunt, they constantly taught persistence
Those with less heart keep a respectful distance
The prey know it's too hot to lay in the street
They find shaded areas a few feet from the heat
'Cuz if not, then, it will be costing one
Who will soon evaporate under a scorching sun
'Cuz when the drought is on, it's little left
Then what lies ahead, dehydration and eventual death



We doing music from the heart
And not from the charts




Designer and most of man
Stands the front-end loader
Hold enough weight that'll compensate the share-holders
Powerful motor controls are mad stable
No room for error, injury proves fatal
Hundred ton air-jack, quickly raise the steel
After blowin' out the belt drive, Math' change the wheels
Bust ya, slash ya, we still thick like plaster
There's always potential for large scale disasters
In the rec' rippin' narrowly missin'
My camp be forced into periless proposition
We must come see ya, despite imminent danger
Was short on fuel, before he flew out the hangar
From the cold dirt, rocks and all, rap galore
Watch the river flow backwards once we storm the shore
Nigga, mark with razor-sharp eyes of the scope
On the ropes, hanging from the towel and cliffs and slopes
The magnitude of the devastation untold
The collective laws of countless souls lay in the road


Insane flower, vein blower
Aim and it's game over
You know the name, flame-thrower
Got the code to the game and I hold the main controller
Soldiers from the jump, and today the same soldier
I stay low, play close to bank rolls
Polly with the greatest who walk the same road
Oh you ain't hear? Ain't nuttin' new but the gear
The crew of the year, kid too much to bear
Find out what I'm about, know the legend
The slight disrespect of his name provoke tension
No threat, bringin' the force like Boba Fett
The old vet whose presence alone control the set
I'm next level, ya best settle, bless Rebel
I shine like a bezel, with strength to bend metal
"Plunge head first in the grunge, become emerged the drums
The verse is murder one


We rhyme back-to-back, deangerous emcees
Move on track-to-track 100 bar measure
Lost treasure, those crews who never gave us much pleasure
Agreed the sound was good, shoppin' in the state, city, town and hood
Eventually they would
Lay down the trademark with god that built wealth
To dip-dive in the beehive was on self
For the power struggle, never clown but did juggle
The heavy load made it explode to mad rubble
I thought of this tune on a blackout guided by the light of the moon
On a camp-out, the kerosene lamp out
So we walked the road we paved
With trails that left vinyl footsteps engraved



 + (Tash Mahogany)
She's my number one gangsta chick (my starter) She's my number one starter chick
She's my number one drafted pick, she's my number one line on the hit
I only wanna see it (my starter) It's truly needed, When the ball drops...
Anything she say, you know I'm gonna do (my starter)
Watch out, watch out, when that ball drops...


You'se a starter, like Candace Parker
Take flight like Skywalker, might wolf it on ya father
Student Athlete, player of the week
G.P.A. 4.0 and her game's complete
Skintone buttercream, all defensive team
Dreamgirl like Jennifer Hudson, you're my Queen
To be, I'm ya King, keep ya under the wing
Together we can capture the ring
You the human highlight, body type, just right
Hairdo stay tight, go hard ball all night
All-star shine so bright
Hall of famer, about to take the game to new heights
You're my number one draft pick, McDonald classic
No look dunks to the basket
Yeah, yeah, that's mine, that's mine...




Blunt smoke, fifth hundred stroke
I'm going nuts, full clip, shoot up her fat lips
And round butt, catch Heat when I'm In Too Deep
The answer beeps, she take dives on the busiest streets
Whatever situation or the circumstances
Outdoor, indoor, she's taking the chances
Hotel, motel or Holiday Inn
Overlooking that bible, she continued to sin
Spread wide on the desk, paperwork all in a mess
While the ceiling fan blowing her dress
Ten minutes of jerking along with the slurping
Her skirt hid her talent until I raised the curtains
Showtime at the Apollo, she'll follow my lead
Then get on her knees, then swallow her pride
Strapped and ready to ride




Yeah, that's my down bitch
That's my down bitch, anything she do for her man
If it's lying on the stand, fish frying in the pan
She a Queen like Liz the third, wicked curves
On her word, stay still, rocking linens and furs
While she do it in the sack, jazz music in the back
Flat blew a nigga back, act two, I'm into that
Damn right, she the star of my team
When we stepped on the strip, baby girl, we the heart of the scene
Whether Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan or Queens
Staten Island, she styling, if not, she's not seen
Playboy status, every man's lust
She acting all shy, but she likes handcuffs


I'm the first on the court, first to hit the dance floor
The floss in this rap sport, what more can ya ask for?
Let ya glass pour, Wu-Tang is here now
All my Independent Women, time to let ya hair down
Bottles popping, everything is fair ground
Fresh legs, window shopping, can't help to stare it down
You'se a starter cuz I chose ya first
Baby, you'se a starter, where you throw that skirt
Lady, you'se a starter, where ya hold it down
Yeah, I'm Cold Blooded, then ya love my style
This is rush hour traffic, first one to merk off
It's like clockwork, first to get ya work off
I'm the workhorse, Killa Bee performer
Pro darter, starter, not a bench warmer, what?




You've learned how to kill
Every moved you've learned is trained to that end
Yet, we wish to preserve life
The first thing to learn, is that difference
Then you can start training with us, from the beginning




Throw down ya mic son, ya gauge is empty
Plus the wack shit in the game might tempt me
Quickly drop non-stop rec shot
What I took on the road on the lap and desktop
A mixture from up-tempo to slow grooves
8-Track figure that's mixed wit Pro Tool
I rhyme wit sense the paragraph was intense
Area's dense with the flow from the sentence
Engine powered by five hundred horses
Press by a threat of joint forces
For emcee's who spit rap to cause beef
Cause they depend on wild kill for fresh meat
On the board, you're just a piece that's captured
Weak is the land that's laying in the pasture
The plug that gave ya juice, I might pull it
Can't escape these endless waves of rap bullets


They got no place for me
In my life can't you see?
I must not push or bite it tell me
Stay in line, Stay in line (Stay in line)
Stay in line, Stay in line (Stay in line son)
Stay in line, Stay in line (Stay in line kid)
Stay in line


I'm not insane in fact I'm kinda rational
Chrome-plated serrated swords slashing you
I shine light to the mic
That's filled with the unspoiled water that's rich with light
But um, you get high off the wealth and livin' large
We rely on the stealth of camouflage
Cut supply lines, flood ya mans market
From high altitude cover the land target
Lost in the desert, the journey is stressful
Where the rescues are unsuccessful
They perish while they search for it, intriguing treasures
Should of taken precautionary measures
The rhyme with the shank in the yard that kept stabbing ya
A shakedown from Alcatraz to Attica
Because we rock the jails
Wit it and mase write the verse on the walls of cells




Ya out cold, ya styles old
Allah just rolled, attack his skull wit a plan less bone
Hit ya king with a Check that caused directly damage ya disco tech
Shoulda' Protect ya Neck


And do they think they got me? I don't know
They seen ya picture baby? Don't think so
Now do your mission and while you were thinking
Ain't no collision that'll stop me from screaming


Involving movements, controlling the squares that's closed in
Wit impact, in fact ya zone is frozen
Submerged in deep blocks of ice
Sceaming a wise by the high-tech devise
The slightest fame can bring pain and torture
The author, who came with a burning offer
Published by whoever made it must own it
Is just symatomic for one chaotic moment






Yo, check this shit out


Hangin out in bars can become no joke
When you start to drinkin gin rum bacardi and coke
Or Martini and Rossi, Asti Spumante
Even forties being shared throughout the posse
Jukebox is slamming throughout the bright moon
With the melody, of a soft Barry White tune
I sit back, like I got it made in the shade
Holding my dick as I talk to the barmaid
Excuse me miss, "Alright here I come
May I help you?" Yeah, double shot of rum
"On the rocks sir?" Mm-mmm, not at all
Who the fucks need ice inside of burning alcohol
I reach in my pockets to tip the whore
But I'm clumsy, my change start falling on the floor
I play macho, and say leave it for the sweeper
BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP my fucking beeper
I start stumbling to the phone booth
Revealing all symptoms of drinking ninety proof
The phone booth door is closed, the light is on
The girlie just dialed nine-seven-zero porn
She sit back, with her legs cocked in the air
While her fingers do the walking through her knotty pubic hair
Her eyes are shut tight, she moans and groan
I hit the glass, "Get the fuck off the phone!"
She jumped up and said, "You just had to be the one
To interrupt me when I was having so much fun"
I said, "Hold up, yo, bitch you think it's cute
To be perverted let alone a sleazy prostitute"
She said, "How can you try to disrespect any female
Or me and my homegirls just because we sell"
I said, "Pussy? That's what you call it?"
She screamed out, "You're god damn right you alcoholic!"
She said, "This is a public phone and you do not run it"
I said, "So is your pussy but can I use it when I want it?"

Stay out of bars (2X)


I was in Times Square, loungin hard
Me and the Prince Rakeem, you know the God
Watchin females posin for a flick
Thinking of who would be the first to turn a trick
"Yo Genius you see that?" "Yeah" "So what you think?"
"Let's swing em to the nearest spot to have a drink"
I winked at one she said, "Hi" in a low pitch
Rakeem started flowing and bagged the other ho bitch
Now we searchin for a zebra lounge
To settle down, right in the heart of midtown
Went to this place, called the Sting Pit
Got inside and seen all types of shit
Men who looked soft but acting wild
Dancing to the beat, Ten City style
Females who wore jeans that were tight
With faces resembling transvestites
Everyone in the bar gave my girlies mean looks
As if they were fugitive crooks
They smiled at me and the God, showin all thirty-two
That's when I caught the clue
As this red-bone, who thought she looked fly
Rolled up on me, and she said "Hi"
That one little word fucked up the whole night
Her voice was deeper, than Barry White
I jumped up, and boy did I flip
I pull out a nine and I empty the clip
The place was flowin with crazy blood
A little midtown massacre type flood
And as we stepped off from the scene
Here's the message I got from Rakeem
Stay out of bars (4X)




Ooh-wee... mmmmmmmm, yeah...


See I was raised out on these mean streets
I'm from the projects, right, where poverty and hell meet
I'm searching everyday to find a better way, I've got a
Hustle still to get my pay before I hit bottom
Now some might say that I'm already there
But who are they to judge or question what I do, son
So I don't care
Tired of eating cheese sandwiches with no meat
Tired of watching all the players from the same seat
So it's a life of crime, some might sing or rhyme
To escape the ghetto before the flatline
Choices to make, what am I gonna do?
Got to use my talents, they gonna pull me through


Now with success, I become a target
They wanna set me up
I guess more money equals more problems
They wanna get me, wanna hit me, strip me of my riches
They wanna cut me up in pieces, leave me deep in ditches


And I can't take it.... but I'm gonna make it...
Yeah... oh... I'm gonna make it... yeah... ohhhhhh
Fight to stay alive


I was raised out on these mean streets
You know where poverty and hell meet
Brothers get jail and life's for sale, cheap
Since momma held me, in her arms, to tell me
That it's a cold world, I done held heat
And held myself down, lot of bodies and shells found
And niggas into taking everything, that ain't nailed down
We fell down, ain't hard to tell now
I ain't trying to see the cell now
Or see momma put her house up for bail now
So I'mma give all I got, to try and get that gwop
Nigga I'm hot with this hustle, go 'head and get the cops
I use my talent to get more figures
Unlike these little corner store niggas
Go change your drawers, niggas


Now with success and I've become a target
They wanna set me up, take me hostage
Or take me down some notches
They wanna hit me, wanna stick me, get me for my riches
They wanna diss me, want a clip me, leave me stiff in ditches

[Hook: Gerald Alston (Method Man)
And I can't take it, no, no, but I'm gonna make it...
(This ain't no game, my life ain't nothing to play with)
Yeah... I'm gonna make it... oooh...
(Face it, money is power and I'mma make it)
I'm gonna make it... oooh...


Yeah, I'm gon' survive, yo, yo, a-yo
N.Y. City, gritty blocks, little love, plenty cops
Few rise, many drop, True Lies, semis cocked
Fishscale, already rocked, heavy shots, that we drop
New guys on every block, blue eyes and red dots
Pregnant mothers, broke fathers, more money, more problems
So hungry, won't starve 'em, work hard and so pardon
I got mouths to feed, I got pounds of weed
I need some more, another store, another house, indeed
An X amount of G, the reason pounds'll squeeze
And strip you naked, basic, trying to make it out the P's
Don't ever doubt a G, and have me spazz like
'Face with the K, and my nose all powdery
It ain't about the streets, it's 'bout the beast within
That won't give in to 'lice, down to bleed, G


Now with success and I've become a target
They wanna set me up, take me hostage
Or take me down some notches
They wanna hit me, wanna stick me, get me for my riches
They wanna diss me, wanna clip me leave me stiff in ditches

[Hook: Gerald Alston (RZA)
And I can't take it (yeah), no, no, but I'm gonna make it...
(Yeah, yea, turn the beat up a little right here)
Yeah... I'm gonna make it... oooh...
(Yo, yo, yo, yeah, yo, just, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)


A-yo, RZA, Meth, GZA, Deck
Ghost and Chef be cashing checks
Killa, Cap be snapping necks
Street and 'Zilla flash the tech
Sacrifice a savage life
If he trying to bag my ice
Tag a price on merchandise
Tell me, is it worth ya life?


No... it's a cold, cold, cold world
You can't be playing games with my life
I've gotta fight to survive, fight to stay alive


A-yo, metal pipes ignite, sparking fire, light the darkness night
Trying to stick me for my riches, now y'all bitches taking flight
Major business, raise the digits, tried to strike me for my life
Slice and dice, men or mice, GZA tell 'em what it's like


A-yo, money making, people flaking, Cash Rules, fuck the bacon
Earth's quaking, head is aching, bank stop, dice shaking
Times are hard, so are jobs, scheming niggas wanna rob
Use a hoe to slob ya knob, hit you with unruly mobs
Stab you in the back and smile, watch you bleed for a while
Hating on the agile, steal ya name and bite ya style
Hold you for a ransom note, Goliath cutting David's throat
Grab ya vest, abandon boat and leave you out at sea to float


Now with success and I've become a target
They wanna set me up, I guess more money equals more problems
They wanna hit me, wanna stick me, get me for my riches
They wanna diss me, want clip me, leave me stiff in ditches


And I can't take it.... no, no... but I'm gonna make it...
Yeah... oh... I'm gonna make it... ooh... yeah...
It's a cold, cold, cold world
I got my hand on my gun, they got a brother on the run
Yeah... it's a cold, cold, cold world
You can't be playing games with my life
I've gotta fight to survive, fight to stay alive
This ain't a game, this is my life
Keep pushing me to the edge, I'm gonna push back
And you won't like that, it's guaranteed you won't like that
When ya laid down, laid flat...




It's the sasquath, Jackpot
The roach killer, that's what we do
You know what it is, you little crawly creepy bastards


We ain't tripping, read the sentence
The Gods got it locked like up on Main in San Quentin
You drinking muscle milk, homey, you gon' get killed
Walking round like Deebo, cuz you slight built
It's a dirty job, we get it popping hard
We turn this whole shit slamming to the Mardi Gras
And ain't nobody mad, it just we got it bad
Like a body being slumped when you hail a cab
Vaccum packed, concealed, no room for breath
I grip a mic, it's Five Fingers of Death
So, stomp the roach, stomp the roach, you know?
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, you know?
When I slip on, the grip-on, no clip on
And on the O'Jay's like Christopher Pawns
And eat with the beast, in the valley of death
Walk on the right, but I shoot with the left
Stomp out a roach with the d-Con breath
All you little rat bastards, I stomp you to death
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, you know
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, yo


Four more seconds 'fore the bomb come on
Roach killer, you scatter when the lights come on
You can run on, and start ducking and dodging
I pluck you, crush you right between the margin
I'm the drill sergeant, I'm the boric acid
The black flag nigga, the bio hazard
The econimist of the bio standard
And he sprayed the myst on them fly's that landed
And I can be obvious or I can be candid, but
I'm shaking roaches off my shoes and socks
Then I, pluck roaches out my Fruit Loop box
Then I, tell my girl to change all the locks
Then I, throw my finger at the hip hop cops
Then I, put on my Timbs, then I stomp the block
Cuz I, stomp the roach, stomp the roach, you know?
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, you know?
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, you know
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach


They known to leech off people for, years and years
They cause trouble by, staying up in, niggas ears
They set up shops in apartments in projects
Bold enough to roll up on, any object
Grabbing on my gear til they pull the label off
They fight for the crumbs that's on my table cloth
They keep they antennas up, the signals strong
They got the neighborhood bugged, that's how they survived so long
Immune to 'combats' and, household 'raids'
Like informants that's living off, government aid
We leave roaches where the remain and trash lays
Incinerate it, they spend they last days in ashtrays
Ignored by the dogs, but, chased by the cat
Like a sneaky ass rat that got caught in the trap
A small time nigga, who didn't have a clue
It take a million of ya'll just to fill up my shoe
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, yeah
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, uh-huh
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, yeah
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, uh-huh
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, you know
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, you know


How long till you get me off the hook? For old time's sake
I can't do it, Sally
Don't ever take sides with anyone, against the family again ever



I see youngsters little teenagers
Walking around with beepers and pagers
And who's beeping them? Oh it's the boss
Making sure no one is taking a loss
On his multi-thousand dollar operation
But how does he thank them for their participation
Whatever the pay, it's still not enough
Cause what they got into is some serious stuff
Hours a day back and forth on the strip
Sending customers far on a trip
And this roots of all evil brings about war
Cause you wanna open up another crack store
Children can't play in the parks and things
Because a stray bullet might be headed for the swings
You never though about that, oh I guess not
All you thought about was owning your own spot
To putting more and more people to sleep
But ya heading for a pothole six feet deep
You see the problem has gotten more serious
And the community is getting more furious
Get it deep in your head I told you so
It goes way beyond just saying no

Chorus: Stop the nonsense

Remember Steve with the blue Jag?
They found him cut up and stuffed in a bag
He had his own operation uptown
And there was plenty other drug dealers he would cut down
In other words he was living foul
Shootin up neighborhoods acting wild
He said he had to protect his drug trade
Which we manufactured throughout arcades
He made sure his enemies felt the pain
Whoever he felt was a threat, got slain
Like Donna, who was only sixteen
And she was employed on another drug scene
She try to set up a hit on Steve
But he sliced her throat until she could not breathe
This is what happens when you deal
You don't care on who you got to kill
I might walk outside and get shot
Because I live next door to a drug spot
And I don't need this stuff in my vicinity
Of me being shot for mistaken identity
This is the stuff that Steve was on
Now he's dead long and gone

Chorus: With his old nonsense






Looking on various street corners
I'm sure you've seen it yourself
Standing on the corner, is an alleged brother
Dressed in blue, or green, red and black
And starting the news, that the revolution is coming
And you better get ready, sort of like (I feel you son)
The end of the world is coming, unfortunately (I got you, though)
The world is just gonna drag on and on (I know how it is)
And we have a poem that we've written particularly (I said I know how it is)
For the brothers on the street corners


When the revolution come, you can see me on the front line
Firing my gun, standing right beside my son
If I go, it's understood that I stood for something
When my whole life, they told me, I was good for nothing
I was raised by the stray dogs, blazed off, layed off
Breaking laws, graveyard shifting every day war
Focus now, notice how, things change, soldier
I remain the same, I'm older now, I embrace the pain
I blame the struggle, nearly drove me insane
Thought I lost my head, till my brethren told me the same
No tears for the reaper, I've buried bout a thousand
In graffiti, "rest in peace" sprayed off throughout the housing
I tried to stay civilized, the hood's a prison inside
The only difference is the doors don't slide
Still we trapped in the animal cage, cause we got animal ways
So we react, with the animal rage
And my section's real, weapons peel, cheddar's the deal
Seen the depths of hell, now I stare, death in the grill
From the slave ships, to today's bricks, same shit
I'm awake, to the wickedness, and one, with the pavement


The all great mind stays divine, my hands remain deadly
We shine without the hung jewelry, produce light
That'll travel through mics, now as the time riping
We took words that we nourishing, encouraging
A nation to awaken, those who were sleeping
Can you conceive the thought? Transatlantic import
Slave and bought, secret relations between blacks and Jews
Might set a fuse off in the head
Many dead lynch hung, swung from trees
Brothers in the struggle together, eat from one pot
Hold each other down to the sneaker
Nothing come between us
Fast money and chicks, did it to the best of cliques
It's sickening... huh

 (x2)
It's me and you son, forever in the struggle
No doubt, we hustle, survival is the motto
Will you soon follow, a better tomorrow
...For a better tomorrow


I catch a few flashbacks about, going through the struggle
How we used to make dollars, from all the snow we shoveled
In a broke neighborhood, where the kids often dream
About a lavish life, that is mostly seen in the screen
Where some dreams are quickly cut short, due to gang violence
From loud guns, that kept witnesses, in deep silence
Was it bad timing? Jealousy from too much shining?
Or a set up, from a girl that he wined, kept dining
It's a known fact, they will attack, cause it's like that
And depending on the, kind of impact, that strike back
In a town where the talk is cheap and, beef is brief
A mother sobs uncontrollably, and exhibit the grief
Large holes in the front door, of a housing tenement
Allows room to retaliate, so conflict is imminent
This hate in the brain, destroys the cells like cancer
Even experts are stuck with more questions than answers




Uh, and it goes like this
Uh uh uh uh, it goes like that
Now let me tell you who I am
Up early in the morning, dressed in black
Who dat? *echoes*


Yo yo
Marvel this theatrical, drama on stage
Broadway classical, led men to rage
Like currents, the beat change and now a flow is strange
You in the arctic wit wolves that viciously main
Thugs that roam clubs, in the dark wit fireworks that spark
Saltwater vibrations comin from sharks
Blood-thirsty kids bite just as well as I write
You're like secretaries who can't type, you're no use
Broke down vessels who want a boost, there's no jokes
Quick fast you, get stumped cuz you played, your organ pump
Kool-Aid, from Indiana wit the Jones of a Lost Crusade
Hip-hop done hit the church, choir girls rockin mini skirts
The b-side kept plenty hurt
Push like the shovels in snow storms
And stack piles of foul, the shit you must GROW ON! *echoes*

Chorus  4x
Uh and it goes like this
Uh uh uh uh, it goes like that


Pay no attention to the evil they speak
You caught the beef wit the equal eye, poisonous beats from underneath
Crack the concrete wit two left feet
Head on my meat
Ain't no games here we playin for keeps (WE PLAY FOR KEEPS!)
Introducing, the crowd seducing man on the street
Penitentiaries is either half-dead or too sweet
Back to basic, condition-al god, plus I can take it
Wagin war within the matrix, it's hard to see
Touch, hear, smell or even taste it, take your places
We runnin in these human races, bucking naked
Back-slappin kid yappin, actin villian catchin feelin like we cap peelin
As if we killin every brick in every project building
From Cabrini Green to Tildens, sincerely yours
Mista Meth and Maximilion (da millions, da millions)
(Ka ka ka ka ka ka ka KAAA!) (da millions ha!)

Chorus 5x


Uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh
Wu-Tang Killa Bees on the swarm (WE PLAY FOR KEEPS!)
(WE PLAY FOR KEEPS!)
Wu-Tang Killa Bees on the swarm
And it goes like this



I hopped on the train and cold clocked a chick
Who looked good as hell but she appeared to be sick
I would say she had to look as if she swallowed a worm
Then again she could've swallowed several ounces of sperm
Giving me the eye as if I was the right antidote
So I decided to swing a smooth episode
While the train stopped at Grand Central turn
Before I knew her name I was massaging her perm
I said, "My you look drunk, have you been drinkin alcohol?"
You got a fever here's an Extra Strength Tylenol
She said, "Great a comedian, comic"
She leaned on me, I said, "Please don't vomit!"
She said, "I'm not I just need some rest"
I said, "A few more stops, The Genius house is best"
Got to my rest, her whole attitude change
But deep inside, she seemed sexually strange
Went in the room and she flopped on the bed
With wild-ass thoughts inside her headachish head
I went in the kitchen to prepare some food
When I came back in she was completely nude
I know it sounds weak but believe it or not
That the fever in her head ran straight to her twat
She was burning! Burning up out
It took more, than firemen, to put that out
And yo, I was hard, just as hard as a rock
That I can hit a home run, with my cock
She said, "Let me show you what we do uptown
I huff and I puff till I blow your balls down"
Wild as a wolf from off Wilderness Ave
She said, "My what a great big ahhh! you have"
I started dripping and dripping in consecutive terms
I know we must save water but that does not include sperm

Did you ever know a girlie who just loves to switch
From a Part Time Lover to a Part Time Bitch
While she's loving part time, she's riding on mine
She says, "I love you long as you keep making me feel fine!"
In her behind, vagina, or heated climax
That I would sew, control, finger then wax
Now she's swingin so low yo she flex like wrecks
Cuz she can set records on oral sex
There's no lie what I said, she lives in the bed
If she got married, she'd be a worn out newlywed
And if she heard these words yo she would not cry
Because sperm, the only damn tears in her eye
Her drip-drop face is the one I painted
Just stared in her eyes while she damn near fainted
As she choked, goggled, then spit up
Cuz cream, was flowing, all over her cup
On the bathroom floor cuz her parents were home
And I just could-n't tolerate her moans and groans
"Genius, oh Genius, oh rock me so hard!
Cuz I don't want to stop, I love you God!"
But there's one thing she could never erase
That the thing she really wanted just sprayed in her face
So she regret, she ever swung low before
But this little hot bitch comes swingin for more
It used to be one, now it's five fingers of death
That rips her insides, as she gasp for breath
To say, "I love you! I love you! Forever so!
I'm getting hot getting hot let me blow let me blow"
What she thought was love, turned out to be lust
That made her live by the laws, in sex we trust




When a motherfucker steps out his place
And gets slapped in his motherfuckin face
Just because the motherfucker tried to base
The G.O.D., the G.O.D
And while I see his whole clique pass us by
Motherfuckers think they qualify
And for those niggas want to try
The G.O.D., the G.O.D


Yo, I'm not caught up in politics
I'm no black activist on a so-called scholar's dick
I come through with the Wu and drop math
And versatile freestyle bombs and phonographs
And deliver, all things in number and weight
Searched to death, on how living things relate
Cause at a young age, I was molded in a religion I relied on
And got caught up in superstition
Scared to split pole, ducked black cats
Once in a while, threw salt over my back
But with knowledge of self from off the shelf
Made things seemed complicated now small like elves
So turn off the lights, light a candle, and have a seance
Pull the lid off the Dean Martin scandal
Witches, warlocks, spooks and holy ghosts
RZA let's defraud the hoax




We were on the same ship when the slaves were checked
I had to pull your card, you was on the top deck
So I plotted my escape, I saw the thin line between love and hate
And fast from the hog on the plate
I suffered brutal pain, from whips and chains
Punishments that were set to wash the brain
So look listen observe and also respect this jewel
Drawed up, detect and reflect this
Light I shine, because my powers is refined
Through the truth, which manifest through eternal minds
Purified gases and masses the same elements
That helped spark civilization classes
I see brothers quote math plus degrees
Limp professin ass niggas can't feed they own seeds

 (x2)




Digestive, endocrine, immune, lymphatic
End your body system, your crew don't want no static
Muscular, urinary, skeletal
We win the battle, capture your mental
Respiratory, nervous, you're nervous
Nervous, you're nervous
Nervous, you're nervous


The science knowledge is flowing out of me like a drug
And I'm never running out of energy mitocondria
And my flow is pretty nasty, it's catchy, it's flashy
And none of you wack rappers can't match me
My team is here to break down the human body systems
And diseases too because most of y'all have some symptoms
But I digress, the problem is most of you cats can't even digest
Digest, I eat my competition up
And all I know is I got them shaking like asma pump


Chewing your food while eating dinner
Down to the throat to the stomach and liver
It produces the bile, it's cleaning the system
The food goes down symptom by symptom
The food melts down on the gastric acid
Classic, it's on the stomach acid massive
Tactic, my bars are everlasting
Double two to the four, call me fantastic
Yeah, this is serious, I'm feeling delirious
Survival of the fittest, evolution
George, I'm curious






Choose the sword and you will join me
Choose the ball and you join your mother in death
You don't understand my words, but you must choose
So, come boy, choose life or death


What the fuck is being humble about? I got the flows
And the shows and the hoes and the clout, so what you talkin' about?
Bathin' Ape by the bundle, no campin' out
With the camp put death to the trash y'all puttin' out
I remember wearin' them all red Vandals
Had them bitches ham when I jammed in a Tan Camry
Since I was 16 I had dreamed of them red Lambos
Success ain't open for me? I'm pickin' the damn handle
For an example, I'm as hot as a damn mantle
Fire when I spit, shit drip like lit candles
Bitches lying and crying, I hit cancel
Hard on my hoes, I'm only nice on this pencil
Handsome, dashing, with the calligraphy
And this is prolly an H now if it is a G
Free Earl I'm screamin' 'til we get to see
Odd Future motherfuckin' Wolf Gang history


Eat a cock and cum mayonaisse ham sandwich
I do harm hammers relaxin' on a hammock
Flow damage, understood Mom's Spanish
I handle it, contain a rock Cal Cambridge
Ever since I got my crew, David and Clancy to manage it
And cuttin' through these tracks, Domo providin' the bandages
Wolf Haley torch the flamethrower
Mike G, bitches askin' him for money like he is the bank owner
Left Brain extract bitches mind and give 'em left brain
Soft synths, hard drums, give your bird chest pains
Ask Syd where we at, she tell you where we goin'
To free Earl from the fuckin' Samoans
If I was a pussy I would be Amanda Knox
Cause I'm homicide prone and I isn't gettin' caught
In a courtroom file ten council lawsuits
I'm fuckin' a judge so none of the laws fall through




How it goes, feel my nose
Like a ghost, I leave coast
When I boast, feel so lame
What a shame, smoke my brain
Got no name, it's insane
What a game, pulled by the pain
Will it rain, nine times out of ten
Ain't got no money, but the Gods make it fucking rain


That's how it goes, the drop, and through your brains
That's how it goes, the drop, and through your veins
That's how it goes, the drop, it's in your veins
The drop I hold, and slow, and will reign


Witch's hair, truth or dare
Chucks I wear, rocks in flare
It's not fair, cause I'm gone
Feel so calm, blast a don
Was upon, it's the dawn
PC-ROM, in my palm
Atomic bomb, Vietnam
BlackLips.Com in Islam




Express train in the wrong lane, the local track
Strain moving through the vein, explain how the vocal cracked
A magician, his assistant sold me Blue Magic
I was told to keep my distance til it became tragic
Now I'm in the attic, in confusion, causing static
If the space is the final frontier, it's through the mathematics
Conciousness creates the material world
She's topless on the counter, but a material girl
But then, it's just a flashing moment, so I acknowledge opponents
A move gotta be made fast, so I don't condone it
Looking at the picture for forty minutes, now I'm in it
Standing on the frontline, captain and the lieutenant
You see that flag of armor? Nothing but a badge of honor
And the piece that smoke up from the pipe, is from a bag of karma
A simple word from Black Lips that sink ship
Before I fire off one, I give 'em a pink slip




Here we go! B.D.I., Buckshot, Mick Boogie and The Genius
(Tabi) Yeah! We in the spot. What up Mick Boogie?


I feel it
Can you feel it?
There's something in the air


Whoa
B.D.I. back
New plan of attack, I'm seein' y'all slack
I got that
Fuck 'em all when I'm bustin' off
Cause y'all niggas will jump shit and ride dicks soon as Russell call
Buckshot is his own boss
I make my own game, feel my own pain, take my own loss
Yeah, y'all niggas is so lost
So far from really comin' out, you dumbin' out
And what about?
50 spliff's a day
Nowhere to go and ain't got shit to say
Huh, shorty
I'm talkin' to you
Fuck with a broke nigga, keep your heart broke too
Duke
Keep fuckin' with them birds
Watch your money fly away everyday, my word
I serve
Chicks like thirds
And seconds but my weapon will let 'em have hers
Little Buckshots, call 'em .22's
Aimin' at niggas with tight jeans and funny shoes
When I come through, everything stop
I give a fuck if I said it enough, I'm Buckshot


I feel it
Can you feel it?
There's something in the air


Yo
You couldn't strike a match for God, who's stoppin' me?
Shouldn't play with fire
Not know it's properties
I'm at a billion Fahrenheit plus more
But at the surface, a thousand times greater at the core
Transform blunt to ashes and that to dust
Soon as the lighter flashes then the levels adjust
Because
Science of breath
We identify with
Then I studied the lesson
Then enhanced the fly gift
I strike a cord with the vocal
In no time
Recirculate, resonate way beyond the local
Travel with the mic in my hand
I walk with it on scene with a lean like a bike and a stand
100,000 light years
Away from the average
I came in the booth to civilize the savage
These rhymes are fabric so I stretch the elastic
Just another verse to father you bastards {echo}


I feel it
Can you feel it?
There's something in the air


Give me a call girl
Not the now now
Telephone get you dialed into my world
Profound sound boy, get it right now
Toco Lomay get hype now
Maiiiiiiiine
Flicker of the light bulb
I'm a member of the flight club
Jet setter, airplane mode
Me and your momma caught the same code
Maiiiiine
You my step-son
Let's talk about it on a talk show
There's more promo for me, young
Next time I make sure she keep the door closed
Test me, I'm goin' to your upper torso
On the tour bus, we T. Bonney star dust
Star Burst in my mouth
Awkward
This west African kid got stalkers
Get so sick and tired, kids gettin' nauseous
Uh


I feel it
Can you feel it?
There's something in the air




What I'm about to flow on is so dope
The average hip hop fiend couldn't cope
Or explain my style because it's hard to define
So the fiend scratch and think and nod to the rhyme
That I lay down in a straight narrow path
While beats are just flowin' off a modern phonograph
Bass loud, high hats crisp and clear
That'll never let a weak MC interfere
Or bring about some technical difficulties
So I got prepared and I wrote these
Rhymes That just broke loose from the brain
Searching for dope beats on the same plane
For you to write new rhymes it is a must
But I come off with rhymes old as dust
Even as a speck of dust it existed
Ya got that?
Forget it, ya missed it


I'm slammin'
The Genius is slammin'


You flip me on the mic, no way
That's me being played in April on the 1st day
Now who's a fool? What do you strive for?
Prime time juice on the box and fans galore
Forget it, cause you're not hype as they want you
With a maximum of 200 your rhymin' IQ
Is 10, meaning thin, you'll never win
So erase that, I'm not gonna lose friend
I know you're gassed, ya charged, and kinda stuck up
But I define your challenge, a total fuck up
And it's critical, a crying shame
How MC's challenge me and die in vain
But you should've came with ya whole rap
Community, now where's your unity
Cause what I see right now is you and I
And you're too weak to stop me from doin' my
Damage, you know, type of body and fender
NAH!, not the same way I did Brenda
But you had the audacity to step to me
Thinking you was Butch Cassidy and you could do me
How can you do me when you don't know me
And out of the hip hop styles ya couldn't show me
One style that may have damaged me
But that's something you'll never see




M.C. means mic constructor I build
That have suckers running like what track and field
When I conduct please don't interrupt
With ya if's or and's or but's keep ya mouth shut
The hip hop style that I own is highly known
To bury MC's like a dog bury bones
And in this field, yo, I'm extraordinary
And in my back yard there's a cemetary
Of meek MC's who try to speak
And off-peak technique that's soft and very weak
Yet they still have the heart to ask me to duel
And like Mr. T, I pity the fool
The shining chrome microphone is the device
That makes me stand out like men amongst mice
So respond to the stimuli then fly
Straight to the sky on a natural high
Cause I'm the transmitter buck wild and bitter
Thinking about tryingme then reconsider
Cause if it sounds tempting boy, I'll Double Dare you
And speaking of your low life, I won't spare you
Cause you're not worthy of the mercy
Anyway The Genius is just blood thirsty
So take a lickin' as the plot thickens
While ya head is took, ya be pumping like a chicken
How can you ever say my style was played
When my rhymes be chopping shit like a switchblade






Chico Fernandez
Sleeping on his guns


Shot rare coins for practice
Map to the fortune, hidden up under the mattress
A lead belt attaches with holsters
Waiting area, two blazing toasters
Hit the stage coach on stallions
Looking for Federal Reserve notes and gold medallions
Heavily pursued by the local governor, a southerner
Sought after by the whole battalion
Fell out a snake within the handshake
Get the drop on them then he exploited the mistake
Protecting his gold he sold by the plates
Ready to shoot while his horses drank from the lake
Deputy saved by the badge on the blazer
A warning shot from one that had the aim of a lazer
Trait by the neighbor a gambler
Who would stack the deck, plus he marked cards wit a razor


Hes called Fernandez
Sleepin' on a gun
Dreams of Santa Anna
Fighting in the sun
Drums so loud from outside
Makes it hard to dream
A rain is fallin hard and fast
Makes it all seem real
Mornin, come mornin
A Chicos gotta have his share
Mornin, sad mornin
What a laugh, and I cried
And I cry, cry, cry, cry, cried


He used to move weight but then became a grower
Constricted boa, the Mochis Sinaloa
Cooperating along in mining zones
For mostly silver and other shining stones
Abandoned political rebel
He moved with a group of Pistoleros flashing heavy metals
Clash with the law triggered intense reactions
Hard labor gave them multiple contractions
Lawmen turned to outlaw, gunfighter cattle rustlers
Hustlers ruff riders useless connections
Everything traversal
Cross stone socio-economic circles


Senorita pining
Chico come on home
Santa Annas losing
Youll be first to go
Sam Houstons laughing
Davy Crockett too
When Anna takes the Alamo
The first to go is you
Mornin, come mornin
A Chicos gotta have his share
Mornin, sad mornin
Heaven will be there

Mornin, sad mornin
What a laugh and out loud
Ha ha ha ha ha






Yeah, yeah yeah now, what the fuck now?
Flipmode Wu-Tang shit, what the fuck now?
Yeah yeah yeah..
Historical and monumental shit
What the fuck now? Yeah, yeah, yeah


Straight smack a nigga right in the face like this was handball
Or make a mural out his face up on a damn wall
Niggas play hard and shit; if you know what's best for you
Y'all niggas better safeguard your shit
Even though we rep brass knuckle rap
Fuck with street geniuses and bowlegged chicks who walk with a gap
Street niggas now the corporate boss
Still go to y'all resteraunt for steamed fish and Irish moss
And y-yo, the way we do it and you see how my shit bomb
Your whole show wack and I'mma cancel your sitcom
Fuck a nigga broad 'til she tired and real calm
You ain't knowin my name tattoed on your bitch arm
The way we blow SHIT is a shame
Casually bust my gun and celebrate bustin a cork on the champagne
Wrote you with a whole new approach that lead a whole team of niggas
Y'all should know I only ball like a coach, NOW!


Check out the light fixture, freak lines like white bitches
Let the mic lines - hang that slang is ridiculous
Emperor of warlords, big gun only fuck with sawed-offs
That's my specialty, more to bust
Shot out my bed parrot keep it gangster Lord
I analyze your work those that got merked were not established
Texture look classy, arm baby 2000 raspberry
S-5, blowin through Asbury
Soon to own steakhouses, glowin like makeover thousand
Them them niggas, robbin from Pinkhouse's
Show and prove, knockin off cab drivers
God, sodomize money, ring two hundred thousand
See the color of the carved out Wu emblem
Baby, it's all designers, tailor-made Wu gooses
Limousine, automatic new uzi's in 'em yo
Relax, cousin just cruise through, jewels with him


Move up the block, giant box blast my song
Non-stop strictly hip-hop, march on
Doo-rag hang long, metal tape is high-bias
Graphics, captured with the colorful, iris
I zoom in, while the listeners tune in
Some assumin they paid dues and joined the union
Lost nigga couldn't rumble in this wild jungle
Quick to crumble, type to be on the stand and fumble
Divine Master, threw on the track that made 'em bleed
He produce at unattainable rains of top speed
This powerful magnet, that left 'em stagnant
Was unlikely in cameras in larger fragments
Un-filled rifle, scout sniper, shots precise
Starlight scope, with the night vision device
Splendid marksman, that'll shoot the one off the dice
Split a grain of rice, in one shot we kill 'em twice
{*GUNBLAST*}




From the mind, thought produced a speck of light
It was infinitely hot, so extremely bright
Within the center of this great shining
There was enormous energy - it was expanding in great timing
Within this fireball was all of space
Special place with information encased
One of infinite beginnings this cosmic clock was ticking
And allowed space to float while it was spinning
All that you see around us
Sun, the Moon and stars - millions of worlds that astound us
The universe in size is hard to fathom
When composed in a region small as a single atom
One billionth the size the point of a pen
Microscopic, but on a macro level within
And unfurled the swirling cloud of light
A star city, a galaxy, with all its might
Within the blinking of an eye expanded beyond comprehension
Then a fraction of a second a new dimension
At a marble size but very unstable
In time it would come with the periodic table
Space was expanding faster than light speed
Moving at the speed only thought can exceed
A picosecond after The Big Bang, music of the spheres
Before the ears, the universe is now sound
Small enough to fit in your hand, a nanosecond later
It was the size of Mars and becoming greater
Fraction of the second later - 80 times the size of Earth
Fastest growing infant since its time of birth


Step into a world of black holes, quasars
Galaxies, supernovas, bright stars
A spectrum of light beams
Images beyond your wildest dreams


Still expanding but it didn't contain matter
Just pure energy that was spinning within the batter
But mass and energy are interchangeable
Convert those particles, not to name a few
Matter and antimatter, the arch-rival
Met, obliterated each other for survival
A war zone, a battle to the death
But as long as there's life and breath there's one remaining left
But an imbalance caused particles to vibrate
Away from the galactic center at high rates
So fast becoming a liquid
And it would be 300,000 years before it dripped it
Despite being perfect, it was in turmoil
Then it would fall back under pressure, recoil
Subatomic particles smashed into each other
Continuous energy years before discovered
Then it slowed down and began to bond
Creating atoms - building blocks of matter and beyond
It was now eight times the size of the solar system
Distance, thorough measurements, I enlist them
Sixty billion miles in diameter
Temperature of seventeen trillion Fahrenheit to damage ya
And it was only a millionth of a second old
And it would be another million years before turning cold


Step into a world of black holes, quasars
Galaxies, supernovas, bright stars
A spectrum of light beams
Images beyond your wildest dreams




I grew up around block parties ready to rock
Behind the rope nigga with my rhymes on cock
The verse shot first nigga who had shit to pop
A bad weather blow the feathers off a hundred flocks
With 70% goose, 30 ducked, get stuck
And each link in your chain is trucked
No ends in this rhyme cipher with nine snipers
Charge of the kiss from the Pied Piper
I live around DJ's, b-boys, MC's
Through rap never thinkin' +Airways+ are TVs
It was strictly all about magnificant rhyme clout
+Rec Room+, 2 dollars with the flyer as we would doubt
Now his wigs pushed back
Name scratched off the plaque, too wild to re-enact
(Yo)


Got to check out +The W+, got to check out-- +The W+
Got to check out +The W+, got to check out-- +The W+


MC's have the right to remain silent
Everything you say can and will be used against y'all muh'fuckers
And Mef can only trust ya as far as I can see ya
Me need ya? That'll be the.. day, ya busta
It gets no rougher when, me and my comrades rush ya
Like red heat with hammers and sickles
I milk like ya baby mama's nipples, got issues
It's just us, so what's what if any can touch us
Then lord strike me down where I stand at now
Wit this bottle of Remy, gettin' fucked up child, listen
The most notable MC, ya source for hip hop quotable MC
Of course it's Tical!




The Princess, the Pope, incest, dope
Choke you by the throat, the chrome handle smoke
The man not for joke, we all out for broke
Plus the herbal that I tote, the murder that I wrote
You can't do me none, my Uzi weighs a ton
I'm comin' from the slum, Wu is number one
I stumbled on the drum, the Gods are troublesome
+Rumble+ when we come, boy you better +Run+, +Run+




Aiyo, it's like this jumpin' out of golden whips
Flashin' mega bricks, outfits, rock ridiculous whips, bitch
Wavy hair, men of the year, bent in the stairs
Sick winter gear, been on position is where
Call him an Asiatic God-body, +Longevity+
Slang rap, you get your whip wrapped
Swing through the hood calmly
Yo what up? Staten Island, Bush, George
Dust your shit off, whips spin off
Get off, slips, which, wiz
Mind di-tects mines, lines lick sick nines
Pick wines, lift up, bill a nigga six flies
Dip wide, dress my shit up, fuck six times, wish mine
Rub lamps, take thousand dollar crystalines





Yeah, yeah, yeah - one two, one two
Aiyyo, Wu-Tang's invincible
But understand the principle
My man Muggs, droppin phat tracks like drugs
Breaker-breaker one two, breaker-breaker one two
You're breakin' up - peace

"We're at the crossroads, our immediate future
Is the worst war man will ever know."


Via satellite from the Wu-mansion
Still branchin' off the tree that sparked any MC
And the fruit that fell far was the ripest
It was Cypress, let the media hype this
Promotion niggas snipe this
Push it like tray bags of 72
Kept niggas in suede rags
Microphone psycho, who flips the mic so well
Hell without bail, in jams packed like jail-cells
Theres no escaping, once my blade starts scrapin'
Niggas flakin', wannabe MCs is shakin'
My sword indeed make more niggas bleed
So swift naked eye couldn't record the speed
I lost ya, wit that offer; nigga that'll cost ya
Feel the strings of torture
Must've been the half-gal
That's the shit he drinkin', that got him thinkin'
That he could trash the ship and get me sinkin'
I told him, "Come back when you're sober"
Drunk-ass punk, on the motherfuckin' Hunt for Red October
Don't even catch me when I'm blunted
Rhymes start runnin' like loops on a SP-1200
Instruments the terror on warship, its corporate
Visual niggas paint portraits


Yo, Check the mic line for wire-taps
We're under attack, man your stations, take aim, proceed
Fire back, all hands on deck: cadet, vets, insert cassettes
Tracks snap heads like berets; catch web-sites like internet
Chief, I detected vehicles approaching from the East
Pass the infrared binoculars, captain, so I can see
Sound the alarm; call for the suicidal-kamikaze ninjas with the bombs
Flashes of neon, all we saw was flying arms
Anytime I come by, alumni cut short their air supply
Send 'em back like George McFly
I, be holdin' this; travel ground like a motorist
Poisonous gas released from my track, its odorless and tasteless
Like Ghost is face-less
Which allowed the God to break backs, and beat a hundred cases
MCs heads weave like trees, in a breeze to rhymes like these
Underwater flow strike like torpedoes
You get plugged more than Del Rio; played short like De Vito
Split the fuck up like Mike-Jack and Tito
Sword cuts sharper than Concorde needles
Call my second private, tell 'em write this important message to Cypress
I heard Yacub's assistant on the island was Dr. Titus
And they just released a new deadly virus
To infiltrate the Western States
It's time to pump out more rap tapes
And use the Wu-Tang symbol to communicate
RZA, over and out...




Call to umm - the call to arms
To draw your swords, to draw your gun


Those that's bout it, M.C.'s I run with
Those that doubt it, on the mic, get done quick
Even if you left in intensive care
I'll have the plug pulled, before your crew gets there


I'm the one you hate to see, your worst nightmare
While you dream of riding the block, and raiding the fair
Enemies get cooked like eggs, while they scramble
He lived, but he still lost his legs, as he gamble
Couldn't sell what he shipped, the shell came from the clip
His lightweight belt, had got blown off his hip
No one on the strip, had the full explanation
Only that the victim had high expectations
Most never peddle above the street level
They cut they last deal with the devil, just to settle
For the crumbs that fell off the plate, of the late great
Who died in the federal state prison, behind gates




M.C.'s don't want none of this, so just stop
Got gimmicks with a bunch of facades, and just props
Don't take the song seriously, they just drops
For the radio, but you ain't crazy, yo


I'm on the regular, slang competitor
I shock journalists, slap magazine editors
Watch the D.P. as he moves towards me
Stuffed on his wordplay, and can't record me
Three dimensional, visual, write portraits
Enough in the photo lab, not to get caught with
Treason for any reason, will only bring about torture
Should of been the nine, on those offers
Ribs broke my plate in the fifth
The fact that the beat came from Muggs, was a hell of a gift
So I, took the present, sent some to the essence
Like the young M.C.'s, who'd only escaped adolescence
The sword remains in shape with endurance
The blades can be quick, when replaced with insurance
But never seem to stop, regardless of the tragedy
Hyperactive rhymes, slingers with charged batteries








Those were the days, back in Junior High
For an 8th grader, my style was kinda fly
And just to prove I was an MC Pro
I often sponsored a classroom show
And the hype part of my imagination
Was making my homeroom a hip-hop station
Minutes before the late bell would ring
I would greet the audience and then I'll swing
A lyric or two as the students barked
(woof, woof, woof) cause my rhymes had sparked
Off something causing the class to mingle
To a rhythm which is now a 12" single
Letting off many styles of hip-hop
Holding the mic that I made in wood shop
Forget gold, my key chain was a cable
Two math textbooks were turntables
And for a mixer, something much cooler
A penny being cross-faded on a ruler
Measuring dope beats that were flexed
From hands that played a drum roll on a desk
From my home girl, her name, fly as Emory
(peck sound) sweet memory
I remember sitting in my art class
Drawing up lyrics kinda fast
The outcome, a masterpiece
Live shows with hyped up rhymes released
As if lyrics were flowing from the heavens above
I'll grab a mic and provoke a push to a shove
From boys and girls who broke necks to see
The lyrics G.O.D

Those were the days


Now it's high school, lunch room's the scene
And I'm ready to flip the routing
In the cafeteria, period three
And here I come with the JVC
I go in my pocket and pull out a mic
Plug it in, check one-two...alright
Now who wanna show and prove their MC skills?
A brother stepped forward and tried to get ill
But when it came time to live out his name
He kicked rhymes that all sounded the same
But I did him in with a matter of time
And he was done with one victorious rhyme
He was shocked because he knew he was rocked
Along with his classmates from off his block
YO!, I'm telling you, I flipped his whole crew
One against one or one against two
Or three or four brothers who swore they can rhyme
Battled me and got taken out every time
From my style and my dope profile
The period of time that I rocked for awhile
As a motivated, dominated supreme force
Cultivated, activated cream and source
The wise educated and born to be
The one who would flip an MC

Those were the days

Yo
Check it, yo

From slow grooves to Pro Tools to 8-tracks
Cassette tapes to VHS to ADX
Regardless of the format, it's liver then Memorex
Colorful megapixels like the centreplex
Feature film from the outer realm and for the ears
Enjoy ya own picture and stay in ya mind for years
My heart pumps and creates surround sound
I brought hip-hop to the top push the underground nigga
I'm 'Beneath the Surface' wit a single purpose
Make sure your ticket is worth the purchase
The story that'll come to ya straight off the screen
Knock ya popcorn and ya large drink upon ya jeans
Written by one of the best while getting high
Intoxicated from an idea that killed the living lie
Observe the flicks, roll wit the credits
Hold that shit, I'll catch you in the edits

(Chorus) Planet Asia
We throw daggers and studied all the old tablets
We going at it wit the uncivilized savage
Respect, on deck be the G O D's
On ya set for the fuck of it, betta keep it G


Yeah, fresh bracket, four metal jacket
The best crackers aligns fish specialist
Ex-Panther, automatic strapped counselor
The worst chancellor
Jamming up the board amped up
Polish professional, the patriotic poor for life
It's a long run using the side of the brain that I write wit
It's mind, body and soul, control wit the mic
Rip jewels to ya dome, segregates the devil from righteous
Black Guerilla, act ill, I'll act iller
Wit the most sophisticated assassinators who stack figgaz
The Language is Pain, the clique is gang
On top I remain and that's simple and plain

(Chorus) Planet Asia


I'm stealing the win, something serious, a sinister blend
Like mixing warm milk and gin
Ya neva stomach to taste
Off balance wit the raw to my face
Chace move like a Panther wit grace
Stay lace, smoke grass
Pour that eighth in the backwood then fumigate
Necessary to make, people to relate to the way
I perform on the stage and prepare for Doomsday
Wit marvelous insane you'll get hit what the tools spray
I could give a fuck what a fool say
I'm trying to bake until a nigga make cartoon cake
And sell like Cypress when they drop on Sunday
Inspired by the streets and alleys, not them runways
OG's in LA, Blacks, Whites and Ese's
You fuck around and best believe today will be ya death day

(Chorus) Planet Asia






What y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
This '97
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to '79


I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultraviolet shine blind forensics
I inspect you, through the future see millennium
Killer Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets, Queen Bees ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block


As the world turns, I spread like germ
Bless the globe with the pestilence
The hard-headed never learn
This my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life standing firm
On foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
Transform into the Ghost Rider
A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire
Who got my back in the line of fire holding back?
What? My peoples if you with me, where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
What the blood clot? We smoke pot and blow spots
You want to think twice? I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums


I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
Vocabulary 'Donna talking, tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what? Run for your brother kid
Run for your team and your "six can't rhyme" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme, your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts, paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought
I got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God


The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang


Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape Hell globe spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anaesthesias
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings


March of the wooden soldiers, C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square we stay in gold like Flair
Escape from your dragon's lair
In particular my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat bass lines on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck, I'm ducking five-year probation


War of the masses, the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song


The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none


Yo Yo Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink, you had a Navy green
Salamander fiend, bitches overheard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cork-pop convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese, is that so?
Ceaser needs the greens, it's Earth
Ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz


Aiyo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer, Blue-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor world tranquilizer
Adjust the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening
Guaranteed made 'em jump like Rod Strickland






Weve just received a report that New York City is under attack by swarms of killer bees. Theyve been seen approaching from Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. We urge you to stay in your homes at this time, as we will be bringing you up-to-the-minute information. This just in: Police are reporting that theres a man on top of a skyscraper, ready to jump. Im told that he is possibly Ol Dirty, a member of the Wu-Tang Clan. The police suspect that there could be some connection between this old dirty man, and the killer bees

I rock the mic at any party
And in the place to be
I'm a true, true fresh MC
I'm a true fresh MC


I work real hard to achieve my goal
From building and bringing out my true inner soul
Which was once on a downfall and then uplifted
So why live life foul when you're talented and gifted
I've changed, rearranged my total direction
Searchin' for happiness, seeking for perfection
Living the true life, a real story
To make you realize the truth, not scream Glory
Glory, hallelujah, not here to fool ya
But to replenish your souls as I school ya
With a greeting of Purified Education
Always Correcting Errors which stops the temptation
Of you doing wrong singing the same sad song
Renewing bad histories for how long
A Long long time ago
Going for mind made The Genius a pro
And as you see who I be
I be The Genius and I'm a true M.C




Brothers need to study some lessons
They are the blessings to keep you from guessing
The questions that is asked by the seeker
Put on the beat and let me born it through the speaker
Peace, a lot of MC's like to say it
And some that advocate it they just spray it
Out and scream and shout, beyond the shadow of a doubt
They don't know what it's about
Just to keep you informed with the significance
How can I prove this through true evidence
Some make me laugh, think they droppin' math
Show and prove is a difficult path
In the five percent, I am the live percent
Those who perpetrate are the jive percent
I be the universal, the Biochemical
Arm, Leg, Leg, Arm, Head is the physical
That keeps rhymin' until it's unbearable
No individual is comparable
You have a problem inform the technician
But he's not dealing with those of superstition
Those who like dealing with it superstitiously
Cross your fingers when you steppin' to me
I don't need beefs and problems, riffs and static
Debates and arguments that's not dramatic
I need action, it speaks louder than a word
Especially when the word is loud and unheard
Word is what? My word is bond, your word is bull
Now it's your card I'm gonna pull






What you know about emceein? (I know a lot)
Can you demonstrate something? (Why not?)
I'm speaking about stacks, GZA (That's all I got)
The raw un-cut material (That's all I drop)


The nucleus of hip hop, rap's hallmark
They had a citywide effort to keep us in the dark
To the new details, distant wisp of light
Evidence of a terrifying threats on microphone
Rhyme stone, numerous parts combine
Strands of heavy metal form the steel arch design
Fit together seamlessly, everlasting rap
Heat-pressure generated by a blasted cap
The chamber when ya rollin' the dice everything count
Clan royalty where the loyalty is paramount
Couldn't be more wrong prior to your pursuing
When ya spoke of us, you understated the influence
As I bury my motor-action, implode a fraction
Of ya investigation when ya askin
Aware about in ya suit and tie, cruising by
The intrepid workmen that sharpen ya shooting eye




Like a child I have infinite patience when I write
The victim's dental records showed they loved to bite
The under like removed off a charged battery
Someone had his ear stuffed wit the sweets of flattery
A live wire, fired the shot in the booth
It wasn't even in the shooting distance of truth
Who broke the barrier causing mass hysteria?
At the darkest hour in the most densed area
In a stocking cap, undercover, while disguising
I'm rapidly advancing our horizons
This path of trade with the sharp blade, open to all across the globe
They simply heard my call
We hit up, the remote and primitive land
Left walking reminders that saw it first-hand
The music was a secure link we all think
On the same page as holding the ink, now whatchu think?






Universal, biochemical
Arm, leg, leg, arm, head is my physical
I keep rhyming till it's unbearable
No individual is comparable


Prepare for the second-coming. Soldiers drumming; the wicked's coming
 watchtowers armed with holy gunmen
We skilled marksmen: pierce hearts of steel targets
Still marching; kill martyrs with God's sergeants
The ill squadron. Peel shots; you can't  us
The holy ghost; leaving kids fatherless like Jesus
We true saviours; slaying the crusaders
Christians use lies to enslave us; the Jews fucking hate us
My rhymes prevail,  are sharp, blasting with force
Go against the God, I'll nail your ass to the cross
I drink the blood of Jesus and piss out holy water
Approach the alter and sacrifice your only daughter
Who in their right mind would ever test Allah?
When we be blowing up spots like Hasbollah
Conquer your kingdom; I'll kick your crown in the mud
Torture you until you get drowned in your own blood




The power that I hold in my hand could fold a frying pan
The Arab sand do as I command
And if I want the night to last across the sky mass
The clouds won't even allow light to pass
My group leave alien loops inside graphs
Bow trees, , flutes of brass
A must-have, like my dagger and cloak
And red streaks of blood on my white lab coat
A virgin first woke to give her her first poke
She crept over to my crib after church broke
Since we ain't spoke, but I hit it dumb ways
The unsaved; some days I don't bathe
Unphased by the light: the scorching flame
Tears fall from the ice dripping off your brain
Even if you cry, it won't soften the pain
Your heart is dead: go and get your coffin framed, nigga




One by one; who you calling your troops on?
Couldn't even bust a grape with spike boots on
Biters are crooks that steal the stage
I read 'em like books, flip 'em and turn the page
Be the GZA; you're living in deep fear
Go home and write and come back in the leap year
With stacks of of shit, you'll be feeling ill troop
Cause you didn't know the scoop on the GZA




We would drive them to the limit
Drive the invading forces to the limit
Where they lose their patience, and they will lose their hope
And the day will come, where they are driven down
To their lowest level and give up, this is the first time this Earth
That the habitual, articulate, how they plan to try and win
They plan to fight and do it here
But making sure, that they're losing their patience
And that they will lose their hope
The third rail will always live it to it's lowest level


Due the hellish events, the days were numbered
Agitated and withdrawn, the addicts wonder
Moving through eternal hell, constantly beaming
In the grips of evil, wrestling with their own demons
An ordinary ride, extraordinary challenge
That get caught between boroughs that was very hard to balance
Where the shots got louder, witnesses kept silent
Through those 12 terrain days of the summer, that stay violent
Soldiers that'll grill, to the boss' desire
Captivated by the idea of speed and quick to fire
Rushed, his orders came in a commanding tone
Carried out, executed within a, battle zone
Action, spoke louder than words, that made him walk
Cuz these kids had came with more music, than less talk
Thinkin' that they was bigger than U.S. Steel
They couldn't close a deal, without a cap to peel
But once the act of fear, is exceptionally calm
With unanswered questions, what harms the firearm
It beats killing the counter, horrific in it's own way
A groundbreaking case, that lasted for another day


This is the city of fast money, expensive cars, topless bars
Movie stars and executives with fat cigars
Record labels that ain't stable, with low appraisals
And the lie that burn bridges due to fragile cables


Write off that unpredictable things could happen
Well aware of the sudden danger, we start scrapping
Violence can erupt within the blink of an eye
As a three night reign of terror, light up the skies
Other uprisings are in the years of making
The young start sizing up the hood, and get to taking
A high voltage power line, surrounds the gold mine
Soldiers on the front line, who sell dimes and hold nines
Many times enjoying themselves, much too much
They hit the clutch, before they pull out on such and such
It's a very unforgiving environment, cuz one out of two
Can get an early retirement, for many different reasons
The tale of the tape, is uneven
What they perceive as a prank, had stopped them from breathing
He was known to run towns, and brutally gun down
He said it was a great risk for him to be around






This is hip-hop, M.C.'s get busy
It's not pop, you'll front and you'll get dropped
You're listening to slanged out goodies, and Timberlands and hoodies
With the rhythm that came from the streets


I was a young one at the time, but started Mic Trippin'
Had rhythm like Ali, when he was rope skipping
I got crazy, when I heard the break beat
I used to lose it on niggas on 4th and Main Street
They couldn't stop the attack, once I moved forward
Many was drawn back, assault was seen awkward
Only armed with the bow, and a mad flow
Poisonous arrows on a mark, that was set to go
Traveling at high speeds, towards a target
I never hit bystanders in crowded markets
Documenters catch this most intimate footage
In the center they come close, label it the hooded
Remarkable clips, of an uncut episode
They was given the safe, but never was left the code
Close up of those, who have paved the road
Invincible armor like that nigga we call The Toad




Havoc on the block, shots from the ratchet, sizzle pop
Slugs spinning outta control, body's drop
You know the saying in the hood, fuck the cops
Certified on the clock, them ducks with metal Glocks
It takes place on the planet in rocks
Take nothing for granted, raised by these thieves and bandits
The enchanted, sticky green keeps my eyes slanted
Hard times coming up in the ghetto, but the Sunn manage
Watch me take advantage, get it, split it, panoramic
The notes I quote, water like the great Atlantic
Never catch me frantic, swift with the antics
Bitch niggas vanish, niggas, they run rapid
Sun of a Man, son of the sun, son of a gun
Breaded from the slums of each one and teach one
What's done is done, son, the game is made
Stay sharp like switchblades, continue to get paid




You know a muthafuckin' hit when it split ya wig back
Young Gatling, strapping a .38 revolver
It's going down, wait for the sound, my soldiers rally round
Ninja men, blending in, with the surrounding
'Nuff gunmen, 'nuff Flatbush yardmen strapped with the vest
No pussy test the God, the grounds is well held
Illegal desert eagle, cadaver dog
Search for the body that's lost, of course, it's BK
You heard niggas got killed for sheik coats and big ropes
Legendary students that sold coke, some blocks that's still hot
From shots popped back in '88
The black gate where son lay, never made the paper
Just another caper pulled by a masked killer, broad day light
Crown Heights, some are Fahrenheit, heat blazing
Cops on the beat, stop the money flow of the street
My dough is whole wheat, the fam gotta eat




"Come On!" - scratched up
"This is hip-hop" - repeated through the scratching




Yo.. yeah
Don't erase none of that good shit in the beginnin
Yo.. spill drinks on ya, get stank on ya
Yo.. yo.. pinky ring shit, yo
That pinky ring shit, yo


It's that pinky ring shit, the legend of masked kid
Shoot out the speakers when my guns get jurassic
Superbad, who am I? Dolemite classic
The vandal's back, hands on Angela Bassett
I handle my plastic, gunplay I mastered
No coke, dope mixed down with acid on record
Broken down and crafted in seconds
Lady's choice, the golden voice still peppered
Better, respect it, bitch believe
I pull rabbits out the hat, tricks up my sleeves
I air out the showroom, the shit can breathe
Fix your weave, behold my expertise


I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back
I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back


Take it back to the peoples, leanin' gettin' rec room punch
We in them authentic alley switchin joints
Major general niggas, five stars
Both arms rock when coke dropped we read a hundred niggas palms
Silencers, garbage bags of hash
For every cop we paid retired now the nigga on smash
Gash you out your burner fast
You swing down hatin me now respect get your fingers off the glass




Yo what the fuck yo?! Yo what the fuck y'all comin for?
Get the fuck away from my door!
We got big guns in here, coke over there
With blue bag and E pills stashed under the chair
And there's Boss Hog black and white pit with the pink lips
Stan thought he was soft 'til he bit his fingers
The shit had me dyin yo, big fat nigga bleedin
Big cat nigga all season
On the beach truck, stuck with Hawaiian ice
Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought FUBU
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
18 karat rap between noodles




Up at Killa Bee headquarters, four whips just pulled up
I saw Johnny sippin Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin off the hip
I sit took three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead king, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ".. Any Means Necessary"


John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all get shot


New York, New York, legendary rhyme boss
Code name Charlie Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
You crash-tests can't measure the threat
I dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah
Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin, feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself
The Noble, Sir I mass mogul
Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals


This is grown man talkin, coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect father Eton with Addies
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see


From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets




{*scratching "Suuuuuuuue" until fade*}




Yeah, yeah
Sham's nine times ultra
Wu-Tang herbs two times great, you heard of me
Nigga, L.A.D., six times ill
Rest in peace O.D.B
La the Dark, Sun large
GZA, Ras Kass, yeah what's up, Wu-Universal
Legendary


Now it's the real beginning of the pages of Shams
Spit that heat rock that make fiends make vapors of grams
Sham's is the greatest fan, rock big cables of sands
Valleys and trunks, I got the mack ten
We can hit the alley with iron and thumper
Take it to the hands like the brand new Leonard
Niggas going no mas, when the bullets go in him
You dealing with a night stick toker
The ice pick poker, trust you ain't like this joker
And the set, devoted to opening your neck
With the tech, as you sit in a Lex'
Your next move, is slipping, your last move is shitting
As your body gets soft, the shotty went off
Little soldiers, you're out of position
Guns go off, Shams is a Raiders fan
A rhyming gallop reporter, columns are lost
White five, black five with dollars to toss
Twisted by the dark side of the force
Black biscuit, by park side in a Porsche
You're off sides in the fort
We are survivors of the war of good and evil
I'm in the hood, in the hood with a Desert Eagle
With my Brooklyn peoples, now feel it


Darkman, my persona's like Tony Montana
How he used to sniff coke, how I puff marijuana
Try, play me today, I'mma kill you maana
From, far with the K, or up close with the llama
I'm like an African king in a castle in Ghana
Chest dripping with jewels, one hell of a rhymer
Study lessons in Medina, building with an old timer
So I, always been wise ever since a young minor
Get CREAM by any means, follow Malcolm X theme
So I'm often posted, in a rumor with that thing
Got unlimited support from the Sing-Sing regime
I'm Hannibal Smith and they like the A-Team
Keep my head on the swivel, when I serve a dope fiend
Upgraded, to a digital, from a triple beam
Fucking with me, you better be real as you can be
La Trapacandi, a well known rhyme general


Who say Ras Kass don't spit fire, he a liar
That's like your favorite rap star claiming he gon' retire
When you mention me, not about penitentiary
Wins and rhyme skills, both twenty second century
Ahead of my time, school niggas like Timbuktu
Cause I'm original, like Black Falasha Jews
Velours by BUFU: Buy Us, Fuck you
Try us, fuck you
You die y'all got gats but him buck too, nigga
Sip the Grey Goose and ponder, then order room service
In Hotel Rwanda, reminder to honor these street scholars
Who ask why U.S. Defense is twenty percent of the tax dollar
Bush gave 6.46 billion to Halliburton
For troops support efforts in Iraq
Meanwhile, the hood is hurting, please believe that
The rape over, Chaney talking, twenty five dollars for a case of soda
Draining tax payers, eighty five thousand dollar oil filters
But won't pay they soldiers, Halliburton workers make
Fourteen thousand dollars a month, privates earn thirteen g's a year
Plus 225 extra, taking fire in combat
Recruit all the niggas, that die from where I'm at
18 years olds told to kill, where Saddam at
But can't have a gat, to protect where my Mom's at
I love to crunk, so what, plus I'm gangsta enough
To piss in Pimpin Ken's, pimp cup, rack a gauge and pump it up
Hot bitches still get fucked, niggas just want a forty and a blunt


Yo, these youngsters they grow up on the block
With the product in they socks and the fully loaded Glocks
Too many die in vain, and it's a crying shame
The murders and the hustles, won't stop as they shoot for the top
Acquiring power through growth and development
On they most dangerous missions, excuses were irrelevant
The brutality of war, never changes
And the out of control desire to win, makes it dangerous
Fire engulfed the set, they feel the threat, greater than
What they ever had, experienced yet
Indictments, sparked excitement, and the thrill to kill
Suddenly they felt the need for a challenge in they field
The great boundaries of both man and machine
Can have one at the point, to murder all in between
Yellow tape scene, dead teen, the mob was his idol
Giving a grim new meaning to the neighborhood's title, what's up




Just another victim of the... victim of the ghetto
Just Another victim, that's how it goes, ooh


Heavy foot traffic jam the hallway all day
Adolescence working for small pay
World so little he could never leave his block
His home bullet riddled so he always need his Glock
He coast with his eye open, keep his metal smoking
Young wasted minds fiending on dimes, coking
Forgot kids quick to break rules and known to make fools
Out of many, down the streets we more safe than school
There's no diploma that can break you from the coma
Of a bloody war in the country, the youth hungry
On the corner hyenas amongst me
Yapping about the stories they be hearing, always swearing
Can't even spell the shit that he be wearing
Caught up in the silk web of material
Superficial stains ya brain tissue, that's the issue
The young is lost at their own cost, dreaming
Screaming how we never hold positions, that's the meaning
Mothers of murder victims share the same grief
The elderly shake their head in disbelief
And no relief came till I aimed
And blast one shot and left my name... the GZA


Just another victim of the... victim of the ghetto
Just Another victim, that's how it goes, ooh


My residence is a city where army veterans smoke rocks
On torn down blocks, drug spots set up their shops
And cops watch innocent niggas roaming flocks
Romanism in tops, papers and knots
Churches and liquor stores on every corner plot
To get money knots some funny niggas act like
They could pop Glocks and those who can't cop
Sisters giving up ass a lot, brothers giving up cash a lot
Babies struggling to become someone because their parent's not
Just another victim of the ghetto, where lost minds settle
When the devils uncivil society and die free
With double 'W' followed by J-D around the necks and wrists
The God is now a dog, the Earth is called a bitch
And all my people wish to get rich in this wilderness to push a Lexus
Ice on everything from rings and bracelets to the necklaces
Children molested within these pest infested buildings
Seeds uneducated in these schools, paint on the ceilings
Is peeling off, but all I see is lost black babies calling
"Please somebody save me, please somebody save me"

 (x2)
Just another victim of the... victim of the ghetto
Just Another victim, that's how it goes, ooh


Just another... just another... victim of the ghetto




This is on some Cash Rules Everything Around Me type thought
Yo bust it yo, yo
We was chillin on the ave, buggin out lookin dap
And these four cold boys rolled up in a cab
They pulled out a tool, said get against the wall
F' that, I'd rather brawl than to go out at all
My man pushed back *blaow* he pulled the trigger
Nah G not on Sin, that's my main nigga
His body hit the floor, blood covered the ground
How that sound? I didn't even get my last pound
The red glare with his tears made me shed
Now I'm fed, my right hand man could be dead
Hell no, I couldn't let em flee that ain't me
Or how me and my crew lounge and be
So we dash with a rugged child on his ass
In the grass his life is now come to pass
The fam made him trip, aww shit the gun slip
My man picked up the burner and emptied the clip
In his back, no slack jack, with sound to retreat back
Wipe the gat and pack it in a napsack
Yo be out cause 5-0 is soon to come
You get arrested and bagged for murder one
I'm in the house with Bishop, The RZA, The GZA
Represent kid you know how it goes dizza


I'mma set it off for The GZA then GZA gonna finish his-a
Set it right here from the beginning? Aiiight bet check it
Cash Rules Everything Around Me
CREAM get the money, dollar dollar bill y'all, check it
I make a rugged bloody spectacle
Technical feast where beats hits like a kick to your testicles
Niggas remind me of vegetables
So I'mma stir fry your brain like the incredible edible
Egg, I got mad CREAM between bread
Rip it on, pass the bone, let's get stoned like Fred
Flintstone when I roam boy it's evident
We only puff on the leafs with the ganja scent
I be the mean black gugger bust a slug in your mug
Watch the blood overflood your head like beer suds
The temple that I am in I gots the mental rhymin
While chumps try to pump the styles of Simple Simon
I be The RZA, yo I gets bizza with my lizza
Here be my nizza, The GZA
Live in effect on KMEL boy


Yeah, and you don't stop yo
Callin all cars, callin all cars, lyrical psycho
Armed and dangerous, leavin mad scars on those
Who are found bound, gagged and shot
While I blast the spot niggas took off like astronauts
Difficult see even your best can't come on down
You're the next contestant
Get your non-lyrical rhymin ass a spankin
I'm catchin wreck, gettin more respect than Aretha Franklin
Avenue and Putnam, the rhyme wreckin center
Bacardi and Rum through those cold days of winter
I used to warm up the cipher with a rhyme that was hyper
Than your average JFK sniper
So yo yo, don't even start it
I roll like Kaufmann, lay that ass out like carpet
25 rhymes a square yard
I hit em so hard he wake up sayin "That wasn't even fair God"
Stop the stutterin boy, save your place for the 5-0
Then praise the lord you're alive bro
I release stacks, you premeditate the grab
You couldn't catch it so you bounce back to your lab
Just to look for what, wack rhymes you couldn't finish
Yeah, I know forgot to eat your spinach
Here's a can, for those who wanna sleep, pills
Cold snorin while they slept on my deep skills
That originated back in Shaolin, an endangered island
Shorties losin blood by the gallons


Yo I gotta go after that boy
After The GZA then we go to a commercial whatever y'all wanna do
Check it, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
You better look out kid cause I'm the Wu-Tang's smallest artist
When I come through niggas be jettin like I'm narcotics
I'm the shorty of the bus but yet I hit the hardest
When I rolled upon your squad you showed me where your heart is
You start to snitch like a bitch cold droppin dimes
I cut that ass short like a tree of alpine
But I'm a lumberjack black and a matter of fact
I flip that track like 2 kilos of crack packs
I lit up quick like a 4-fifth automatic
Who got static, like Spike Lee I gotta have it
I gave it to your ass raw like a proud faggot
I keep it movin like I did on my first LP
I stay true to the grain of G.P
Word to my mother I can never be a sucker
I die hard too, yippie-ki-yay muthafucker



* samples were not cleared for the official album release


Y'know? General, general! Word out...
Yeah...
Aiyyo man.. you poppin fuckers
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


It's just rules with beats - you clown niggas can't rule the streets
We set shop! Wu-Tang, we rule the East
Taking over the block!
"From the gate now!"
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
Aiyyo, it's just rules with beats - you clown niggas can't rule the streets
We set shop! Wu-Tang, we rule the East
Taking over the block, you can't fuck with the block!
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Aiyyo, I stay funky and piley, blue Excelero
They lookin for me, what the fuck you behind me for?
Stressing everything I breathe on
I'm from the boulevard where niggas get jacked and peed on
Whatever homey, we more lavish
I might sneak you in the crib, see my lasers and glasses
Try to get my come up on
Yo, and when you see me, you know I got my "come up" arm on
Cartier called me up, robbery here
We got your seed in the back of the Beemer starving
We like lion killers, catch me on stage with the gauge
In my right hand, grenade and this leather bomber
I scout money, you know we hungry and talk funny
Coughing out corner rappers, don't never walk up on me
I write with only insane Malkovich
My troops gave me money to clown with them, fuck it
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


My first gun was a .32, back before uh!
Graduated to the .38, maybe a nine
I prefer the fo' five, stay alive
Techs held the crack gank in '88
8 oz. straight from Florida, the best temp
Camouflage vest, repping the set
Wu on the east wing, twenty-ten, sexy bad
We up at Spain with that thing thing, my crew strong
We take no search for your party dunn, you know how I run
Spray places, cover faces, beat cases
A big mouth will get your teeth knocked the fuck out
Keep a nunchuk, take money, stay ninja
I injure, any motherfuckin contender
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Hey bitch, your time's up! Go finish them rhymes up
All my soldiers is lined up, my corners is crimed up
Niggas know where to find us, settin the grind up
Police checkin them pies up, my rims are shined up
Wu! We on the rise up, crops supplied up
Plottin niggas demise up, boxed in conduct
Scratch we got 'em sized up, and when the East is in the house
You, you, you, you, you...
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


On the side of the projects, grey skully, bubble 'Lo goose
Mac 11 tucked in front of the belly
Prestigious moves, we killin 'em, hoes we drillin 'em
We like George Foreman out in the streets, we grillin 'em
In the van, .45's and dilly's, ready to slam it
House arrest box is goin off, Tony got grams
Gotta bath tub full of white, lay in it like Sam Montana
Tune 'em out, to blow out, chop 'em like fans
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


This is boulevard hard, lounging in your black car
Camouflage rat guard on "Stomp the Yard"
I-N-S spit monster bars, flip long regards
My click dons bitch, y'all are frauds
I get it in like Tim off the glass
Slamming my name, I'm like the prez, sending men off to blast
What I spit, make 'em spend all their cash
I'm so Wu, so new that I ain't ripped off the tags
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


RZA done birthed us, some curse on purpose
I'm the grouch, my mouth is a circus
Burner plus a good learner, don't need a hood
All I need's a good burner, Nat Turner
Snake rat murderer, all I hear is turf talk
Rack rooms full of goons with bullet wound birthmarks
From the first spark, you heard my response
(Wu-Tang!) More results talkin 'bout whole crew's mission just lost
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Out the beehive, you dip and you dive
But you still can't survive, you can't see past five
Check the outlook, this is not in the book
You bein dragged across the floor while your 'dro in my hook
Lyrical joust, found all the deal off the books
Steve Rif gave the nod to Universal, good look
Still spit poison venom, Red Monkey and Wu dem
Have any dudes seen the condos? It's all 'em
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Put my +clan in da front+, +reunite+ 'em
Make 'em all R.S.V.P., if they want it, we don't invite 'em
No beef, less talk and more action
We parole as a whole, we'll send you back in fractions
Break through fanatic, low crates deep in attics
The Abbott pulled out a .45, looped with static
I scrolled through the menu then rolled to the venue
The dress code is armor all, put a hole up in him
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)




If only we can lay our hands on that vixen Yu Shin Hua
Then all our problems will be over...
Yu Shin Hua!


You thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed


The quintessence, father of the hip hop renaissance
My slang been around before baton and Benetton
I've been on, fingerprint, two finger tips
So when I squeeze the rubber grip, release the clip, then leave the clip
C-Cypher Pigs can't identify it
The true and living God, son, we exemplify it
The most complicated 'formance of life, we simplify it
Bzzz, don't knock it til you try it
Flying dagger, make 'em stagger, then I take a swagger
Ice cold Jgermeister, take a drag of
Humboldt County kush, slide like the Nike swoosh
Bruce Almighty got more problems than Spidey, look
Old Brooklyn, Putnam Avenue crook, I've been tooken
All around the world, rooked it then, drive back in Brooklyn
Good looking, son, yo, son, bring the hook in
You can never find Zig weak spot, stop looking




From the continents to Croatia, I'll flame a lamester
With the new slang, much more to show ya
These rocks change, Glock fully, hot pellets
Have me running through the hall, it's on, like you being chased by the relic
Can't nothing harm me, yo, I move through any project
With logic, few semi's, hide in the cockpit
Scream out, Shallah and I'mma tap in, harder than Tinactin
Don't try to play the fella, I'll blacked in
Moving all miraculous, the slap smiths of the rap game
Say my name backwards, you'll get back changed
Black man, black hooded, moving through the city
Like you Batman, still you so pussy, like Catwoman
Don't bother the Legion, more squeezing, more reason
To light a new block up, cause me to cement shit
Powerful block shoppers and all niggas getting that guac
Dare you to try to find my weak spot


You thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed

Verse 3: GZA
I stay on the 64 squares, while controlling the center
Trading space for material, the time zone I enter
It's calculated by movement, from pushed pieces
Advances in development, once the pawn reaches
The 8th ranked, now heavily armed with a tank
My opponent's base is threatend, soldiers cut with shanks
Moved all my small pieces, MC's are driven back
Unable to avoid capture from the attack
Such movement, is naturally quite unsound
Men is badly placed upon dangerous grounds
Loosening their position, before they were strongly posted
Before the double rooks had approached it
They must've been quick to ignore the principles
Rock a V and an effective God is invincible
A strategic plan, just the way I envisioned it
Many fallen soldiers in complete imprisonment


You thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed


I tell you, right, right, right, in ya muthafuckin' face
Muthafucka, you know, well, you know muthafuckin' well
Whenwe don't play that shit, or, I don't play that shit
That's just Wu-Tang. You know, I'm the nigga
That...that, give it to ya raw
When I said "First things first, man, you fuckin' with the worst
I be stickin' pins ya head, like a fucking nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with the fat rugged stack
Shame on you, when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zu"




Who in the hell teaches you kung fu?
Your master must be an ignorant idiot as well!


(Uncle Ricky, would you read us a bedtime story?)
Nah kid, but I'mma give you one them old Raekwon crime joints
Feel me? We will, we will
We will, we will -- here we go


Well it was late one night, walking through the park
With my leathered down coat and Wallabee Clarks
Getting my step on, big shit, big six, big wrist
So much excitement in the air, I was crisp
Money suitcase, Louis joint
(yo, Rae, I'mma get some shit just like yours!)
Go make it happen, black God and get rich
Saw the D's fly by, in a New Yorker, yup, tints and shit
They made a right on me, them last two dicks
Know I seen 'em, Max loaded, jog right back to the car
They spun around again and blast their shit
I dropped a Backwood, a puff and then a 6-4-5
You'se a live nigga, you almost smashed your shit
I'mma don my way out the bitch, moving through the car
Nice and slow, two hoodies on and a golden pit
Nigga had a white eye, they both blacked down
What's the clown shit for? The dog jumped in the whip
It was a trained one, wops pointed at me (yo, nigga, freeze)


I told the Chef Raekwon, pump the brakes
Slow it down, you know these C-Cypher Punks scanned your plates
Release the seatbelt off the shoulders, a mile ahead
Then the vibe got a lot colder when the marksman said
"Black niggas in the Jeep, get the fuck out the car"
Put your hands where my eyes can see or suffer a scar"
He was a veteran, who kept, pepper spray in the canister
Donut shop lounger, thirty eight brandisher
On top of that, the blunt smoke just rang a bell
Of his bloodhound who had an acute sense of smell
Beef tripping, saliva dripping from razor sharp teeth
That was pointy as the daggers of the Indian Chiefs
Same cops known for extorting pimps and booking whores
Aimed Glocks at me and Rae, cause they was looking for
A few MCs wanted for a string of break-ins
Last seen, wearing long minks and snakeskins


We will, we will, rob you
We will, we will, Glock you
We will, we will, what? who? (not you)
Here we go


You know my Clan done ran from Japan to Atlanta with stamina
Peace to Chef, Mr. Meth
Move it on your left, with the Iron Lung breath
Ghostface Kill', U-G ill
Deck so real, Dr. Ason Unique, the medic
Ahh, Allah Just, The Abbott, y'all niggas can't forget it
You might catch a Cap if your shit ain't Street
Allah Mathematics make the cypher complete
See knowledge is the foundation of existence
To know starts the spark of the flow
Wisdom activation of the Nation moving
Wise words, show and prove or understand the 13 letters
And the Masta, culture be the way of life
Freedom is reward, who will pay the price for the power
Spending hour after hour, preparing his self
For the hour, now look how refined
When the mind and body is one, every part of me
Supreme equality, manifest the nature of self
G-O-D, now build and add on to the truth
Destroy the bullshit, born incomplete




What are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
A neck full of gold, material things huh
That's what silly girls are made of


On a scale of one to ten I seen a girl about a nine
A slave of mental death, if only she was divine
Walking down my ex-block, the block Monroe
I said, peace to her, the girl said hello
Well hell is low and the lowest you can go
Is thirty-two degrees, below zero
So I started to rain on this young girl's brain
Causin her a great mass of physical pain
She said, "Tit for tat, step off my bra strap
No diamonds, no gold, you cannot get a rap."
Then I said, "So what?", as I grabbed her butt
She smiled for a while but her mouth kept shut
The girl is eighteen, just birthed a child
You're young in the brain and your thoughts are wild
You're on welfare, yo but you don't care
You say, "FTF is always there."
Yes FTF meaning face-to-face
The main headquarters of your local place
Where you collect your bi-weekly pay
To support the foolish habits you abuse everyday


What are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
"Yeah that's right, I'm juicin em, I'm juicin em dry!"
Is that what silly girls are made of?


There has never been a dame in my entire life
My girlie, my ex, my next or my wife
There has never been one who tried to disrespect
Especially a member of the opposite sex
Yo bust it, there's somethin that I gotta let out
But I don't want to be known as Ralph the Blabbermouth
Silly girls, they think guys are soft
But all they wanna do, is knock their boots off
And just from obtaining the common sense
You can tell that the girlies seem rather quite dense
Other than dense they play slightly bold
But from the statements I made they could not uphold theyself
They break down, and they start to cry and said
"Oh! I don't believe this guy!"


Now what are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
"It's all about the finances" "Forget the romance"
Is that what silly girls are made of?

What are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
"Guys with cash" "can rock my big a--"
Is that what silly girls are made of?


Silly girls on a strip, struttin back and forth
Watchin cars, thinkin of G'n off
Lookin for gentlemen, who they might swing
And attitudes, like you can get anything
You wear tight bodysuits under long coats
But ain't satisfied until a pervert slice your throat
You're young you're dumb and you used to be innocent
When young, now take a look at what you've become
A bloodsucker, trying to get all you can
Out the pocket of thenext girl's man
Just to clothe yourself in gold and jewelry
You wear tight jeans with attempts to lure me
Into your web, cause you're livin like a spider
And playin it off, like everything's Ore-Ida
You come out late at night and roam the streets
Like thiefs, stalkin a piece of flesh meat
Is that what you do for a living get paid?
C'mon, there's plenty of ways to get paid
But instead of living the life that's clean and sturdy
You'd rather go out and get your knees dirty


What are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
"He better buy me some gold bamboozles" "And some Fendi too"
Is that what silly girls are made of?

What are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of



First of all, don't leave home without it
Without what?
The gold card
I'm tryin to tell you now
I don't lay on my back for free
You know as they say
If you wanna Taney
Ya gots ta pay


Yo what's up gorgeous, what's your name?
Baby let's talk about your assets first
Alright baby, well let's go for a ride in my new car
What kind of car you drivin baby?
I got a new Yugo
A Yugo? C'mere
You go, get in your Yugo
And get on out of here!
Girlfriend, tell him about hisself
I don't believe him, he got champagne thoughts and Bud Light money
Bud Light money? A Yugo? A thirty-five hundred dollar car?
And you steppin to this? I take only Benz's and better love
Forget about the love it's all about the money
So let's go put on our silk suits and step to the club tonight
That's where it's at
Yeah, money




How I be rolling, holding my sword, Lord I be zoning
Going hard in the moment, only God can control him
I told 'em it's not a game, show 'em, know how to flame
They broken, I got 'em smoking, he stroking a lot of dames
Saying who the boss, stupid 'till you prove it, it's talk
I'm Anakin before the Dark Side, moving with Force
Of course ready steady winning the feeling
The rain heavy, confetti, bet he be toasting up
Pepsi and Henny, plenty before him had bored him
But all that saw him had soared him
He the king of the kingdom, forefront of the forum
Scoring like I'm Jordan, applaud and they support him
Reflection of what they taught him, salute him in postmortem
Don't short him, don't try, can't play him
Can't stop him, don't try, won't phase him
The money, the broads, the cars, nah they don't make 'em
The CZARFACE Part 2? That's a bold statement


You'd rather sweat out a fever in Liberia
With 50 men that fit the ebola virus criteria
With nurses dead in puke unprotected
Infected area, ice-grilling ISIS while isolated in Syria
Now that's a bold statement and it's real
I find 'em all in infuriating
Kinda like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D
With two bars kill your five man group
They got a three word vocab like "I am Groot"
Gimme Tylenol and Advil cause I'm violent of the head still
I silence all the devils when I'm wilin' with the rebel
Esoteric, I run rap like freestyling on a treadmill
I'm a giant with a pencil, modern science wants to stencil
You never get the calls and bitch about how crooked refs be
Your style's pesky, like spelling Mike Krzyzewski
Bars dumb/hot like a Fox News anchor slut
Hang it up, your hottest shit I trump it like Gillespie


It was a concocted tale that was convoluted
Lawmen and prosecutors heavily armed to shoot it
A storyboard that was rough and rugged and filled with splinters
Courtroom colder than the Alaskan winters
A wild dog bit the extended hand
Exposed the secret world of a tormented man, damn
In this world, loose tongues are cut with razors
Something major, inside the darkest corners of twisted behavior
The lowest and hottest places on Earth
Large pools of sulfuric acid marks the turf
Giant land masses that pull away
A crack in the crust no trust and the killers are willing to pay
Eruptions for years in lakes of lava
Huge dome of rock on the block that's from the plaza
The youth has risen to the challenge
Cause the grass isn't green enough but its blades are sharp as talons




Yeah..
Test, test, yeah
{From the East coast to the West coast, ? battleground ?}
Check test, yeah
{Represent everything, everything is real now..}
Wu-Banga strangler

Whether describing facts or interrupted by quotes
Cease the bullshit, rely on volts
Just like watts push the juice through amps
Rap generals running troops in camps
Armed with heavy slugs, under rugs, thoughts bugged
No holds barred, live and unplugged
Trapped on the other side, of electrified, steel doors
Once in, greeted with thunderstorm applause
The message breaks the concrete barrier
Launch the vessel, known as the A-1 carrier
Sound going through a cable, who the fuck able
Mix this shit, but your turntable unstable
So if the beat smash your eardrum, you heard well
Then the tube tech equalize occurs well
Beats straight off the box, rhyme unorthodox
From the Isle', where the drinks splash straight off the rocks

{*walkie talkie interlude*, *fat lady singing*}


The witty unpredictable, outcome critical
Nigga quick to forfeit, portrait visual
Analyze the picture, memorize the scripture
Separate the cut from uncut with the sifter
Rap wall designed from the best, bricklayers
Names tagged in prints from the best paint sprayers
Unheard of, two-thousand feet deep in the planet
Surrounded by the most thick massive walls of granite
Certified A-side Wu-Banga strangler
Control slide time in the multi-disc changer
+Liquid Swords+ and razor sharp shanks leave the tank
On the seas file in eighth rank, ship sank

{*walkie talkie*, *fat lady singing*}



Who's your rhymin' hero

I use lyrics versatile, beat up, on any style
Treat em like stepchilds and smile
I grab the mic then I check one two
Brother's look, "yo what he's gonna do"
Hmm, you know I don't get too hyped
I just fully load up the brain and cock the mic
And blast off rhymes, within a matter of time
I'm like a mirror of organized crime
For slaying an MC who think that he might be
The first brother who could come up and fight me
Start running like you're looking for P.C
Protective... custody
Cuz I'm blowing off, just for going off
You may think I'm showing off, cuz every rhyme is flowing off
A dope beat that is so sweet to the eardrum
Gets the crowd prepared to hear some
Super, high-powered lyrics, specially chosen
The battle's a snowstorm and brothers are frozen
Thirty-two degrees below zero
Now who's your rhymin' hero (3X)

The Genius, is a rap professor
Casual dresser, you may dress fresher
But the way I speak is so poetic
Describe me on the mic, I'm energetic
Even if you roll up strapped with an uzi
Still your wack lyrics couldn't 
Yo, I'm not the type of guy
Cuz my lyrics are high powered, meaning fly
I'm not barn, I'm building hard
You thought that I was weak, well let me speak
With me being frozen this MC weather come to
All linked together
See I got wreck, wrapping things in check
You got germs, worms, plus a lack of respect
I'll be teachin, you couldn't handle
A style like mine, I dismantle
Just by pickin up the mic, and start showin
I cold turn it out, and yo then
I get super serious strong and then furious
Give an MC something to make them curious
On, professors, in college
I stomp em out just with supreme knowledge
Bustin up witches, yo I give stitches
Super-suckin-fuckin-lickin-some-sexy-scali bitches
I go off, and off men often
See the December's Primatene Mist coughin
Cuz I'm the God building hard never barred
Bringin crazy static to your attic
Now I'm known to flip a show
Now who's your rhyming hero (4X)

You have some MC's who get too hyped
From a ten word rhyme it took em hours to type
That's not MCing, just an MC being
Weak on his words and never thinkin bout freeing
Positive thoughts that I let come out
I'm The Genius of this, I know what it's about
Cuz on the mic I'm a leader, school I am a reader
When it comes to sex, a strong good breeder
MC's max but every one I wax
And collect the cash money without being taxed
Now that I have your attention, I'd like to mention
Don't battle me at any rap convention
If so I'll show all who wants to know
To detemine who's an amateur and who is a pro
Don't mean to get ill, cuz I know how you feel
You lack words like mines, talent and skill
Now I'm known to flip a show
Now who's your rhyming hero (4X)



 + (samples)
(Make me yours) He get out of line, break his fucking arm...
You know how it go (What am I supposed to say? Yeeaaah)
You know, word up, not playing the games, with these niggas, man
(Somebody tell me what do I do...)
None at all, man... hit 'em off, none of that, man


Aiyo, jump out the Acura, crazy heavy, what's popping?
Us locking the game, word to every hand on the locman
Street gwop, everybody eats, sweep blocks
This is a message, ain't go no grams, we gon' beatbox
Study like lessons, niggas in the game biting the grain
You knowing where it came from, stop it
You thought we wasn't coming? You dumbing, you blunted again
Watch Lex get that dough out ya pocket, rhyme all 'pallegic
Can't nothing move when I rhyme, when I drop lines it's law out in Egypt
Love ups, don't need no batteries now, what?
The only niggas that'll glow'll be us
Yo, throw me in Sin City, leave me with the vultures and bats
Then give me two weeks to bubble like Kim titties
Dirt Dog, we miss you, now it's time to murder the game
Cuz if things change, you know it ain't against Wu


What am I supposed to say? Yeeaaah
Somebody tell me what do I do...


We keep it hot, keep the heat on the block
We never stop, drawing water up until it begin to drop
Raining with the patchwork of puzzles
That was written in the year of the dragon
More raw than you could ever imagine
How much of a great blessing to a rap city
Where the youth is organically fed, from the Witty
Unpredictable, Talent And Natural Game is lyrical
Analyze the picture, the portrait, the visual
A Cuban Link Chef cooks spaghetti that's untied
RAGU nigga whose tomatoes are sundried
He gave y'all niggas whiplash from bling bling
But my rhyme'll give ya hot flash and moodswings
Math shed light on divine secrets, then science leaked it
For the lower level creatures that can't peep it
I observe MC's, regardless
From a neighboring world which is ten times the sharpness...




Let the track wind and ya mind flow free
Remain conscious on this ride to ya best ability
Infinity, back to the source of which it came
Energy, see it change forms, atoms being born, never ending
On and on and on and, travel with me
Not trying to convince the pack, that it's a fact
For those who can't adapt, I lived it, shitted it back
We have agreed, you'll feel the impact of the truth when I'll squeeze
The brain feels something pop, hip hop, locked in texts
Fat checks, fly whips, jewelry, chicks
Enough kicks, fitted crown, buttoned down
Underneath the white T lies the four pound
This is forty-five minutes of menacing
Dismantling, any MC opponent stepping in the zone
Get ya face blown (Get ya face blown)




Observe the word, when I speak, get the truth's heard
True to the curb, Wu classic is the new birth
Spreading the blessing across seven continents
Arm of the trench, there's no form of defense
Entertainment, nine swords swing rapid
Check the techniques, first bow to The Abbott
Witty Unpredictable, gritty individual
Valid, if it's Actual, Talent and it's Natural
Game, rugged like the train, pump it in ya vein
I and I ride or die under the name
W-U, the primary, ya secondary
Definitely not necessary, the legendary
You printed the blueprints to do this shit
Moving the youth in the bricks
Spit poison tipped darts that rip hearts
Through the chest, when I manifest my sick art


Speaking my mind, fall in line when I spit mine
Still in my prime, still'll shine til it quit time
If this is a crime, find me guilty, I'm so sublime
So rapid with rhymes, sayin' I'm slacking is assonine
Revealing the truth, catching feelings, it's still the Wu
Gorilla the booth, body armored, them killa proof
In living proof, I'm the Wittiest Unpredictable
Most Talented rap muthafucker you ever listened to


I'm a hustler, I grind til my pack is done
Give a seed mad knowledge til they crack and run
Can't nobody fuck with me, I'm just too nice
Smack niggas in they head everytime I write
Yo, I'm straight from Park Hill where the guns is popping
Where them little black kids do they grocery shopping
Go to school fucked up, it's Africa Island
We poor in the bricks but inside it's nothing but talent



* slight variation between the original and the re-release in song title


One two one two check one two
The Genius in the place to be


I make the mic pump my mic makes the party jump
And poison beats make hip-hoppers stump
Their feet kinda wild, to give off sparks
But I'll still light it up when the place is pitch dark
Now that you witnessed me this get this correct, rap wreck
When I'm speaking it's the God projecting
Facts into brains of those unaware
Now you're afacing the truth in the square
Biters like biting, then yo you should chew this
Your man wants to beef, then we can do this
Then when it's time for you to face the God
I'll be giving you the whole nine yards
With lyrics that breaks the laws of gravity
So sweet to biters it gives them cavities
And can't be healed from the strongest toothpaste
So keep biting to see how the truth taste
You need guidance and self-assistance
Cause you lack the training to go the distance
But I'll rhyme, to the fullest length
And this is just a fraction of the strength


Of the Genius
Words from a Genius


I'll never sweat an MC then say I wanna be him
Cause he makes a hit records and flips a coliseum
I learn to lead myself, not be a follower
I'm not a biter, stupid rhyme swallower
I created something funky fresh funky new
Brothers started playing monkey see and monkey do
Should I explain hip-hop, okay I love it
Simple definition but ya still don't know the half of it
All I need is a mic, a beat, then I'll step free
And flip like I'm bugging off Bacardi and Pepsi
Dancers on stage like Alvin Ailey
While I'm deep into the roots like Alex Haley
You wanna try me, and be worn and torn
Step forward, I'll get on and start to born
A pumpin self explanator rap
Make a sucker MC like you clap
Your hands, while you clap the sound's intact
You react like an infant response to Similac
Or then again, could have been Enfamil
But for your information the rhyme is real
MC's wonder what's hip-hop thunder
Tell you the truth it's just One Nation Under
A Groove, getting down for the funk of it
Like Fred Sanford in the business for the junk of it
When I'm premitted to break down a poem
I'm like knotty hair rippin out teeth from a comb
One by one so who you calling your troops on
Ya couldn't even bust a grape, with spike boots on
Biters are crooks and try to steal the stage
I read em like books, flip em and turn the page
I'm The Genius, you're living in deep fear
Go home and write and come try me next year
With stacks of rhymes or you'll be feelin ill troop
You being stuck in the ice cream and didn't know the scoop




Some say The Genius, has a style of his own
And his hands are like Vise-Grips holdin a microphone
Flowin smooth, with rhymes that are rough
Because I can't get enough
So I practice not what I preach but what I teach
In which the critics say is improper speech
But it's proper, only to those who understand
Why I walk on stage with a mic in my hand
As brothers look on, label me as a psycho
Just because I'll jump on stage and grab a micro-phone
From a so-called said to be MC
Who admires me with jealousy and envy
My rhymes are delivered with style and potential
Words are flowin smoothly in a sequential
Order, revealin hidden tape recorders
Stuffed inside pockets and those I'll slaughter
But I don't get upset, when you bite and steal
I go home and write some ill
Stacks of poetry, page after page
Imagining the scen-ery onstage
I catch flash-backs of the seminar
As I crush the dreams of a wannabe star
Self-explanatory words are shifted
In a unbitten style cause I'm gifted
And talented, with the lyrical ability
Bound to fuck up a hip-hop facility
Damaging MC's who dare to enter
The center, then challenge the inventor
Of an impartial rhymin status
Followed a relevant apparatus
The way I come off on the mic is attractive
I can make a quadriplegic hyperactive
With lyrics of friction causing mics to spark
My style couldn't be bitten by a shark
MC's don't understand the way I be bombin em
Roll up and ask me what's the phenomenon
First of all homeboy when I'm battlin
I'm like a doctor shootin deadly insulin
Into MC's like that of a syringe
And dare you to seek for revenge






Yo, too advanced, Digi' stance, made the CD enhanced
I move with the speed and strength of ants
Identical in form with the Bees they swarm
Hold up, the cold current appear warm
My first verbal brawl, started on some yes yes y'all
To the beat y'all, break your windshield, your jeep stall
Mr. Traffic, dumbin shit, from ecclesiastic
Cashier, holdin out, fine, cut off the plastic
See the logo? A monument in hip-hop
Carved out, in the giant landscape of broken rocks
Whether heard in herb spots, jukebox or malt shops
Uncut live, drop eighty-five, in one shot
Spotlight hits the metal mic, majority stare
Heard the Wu snare, while my iris cut down the glare
Walk a road the great length you find too long to measure
My Clan'll make me rhyme like D. Banner under pressure
No surprise, double disc touched five
Those elements kept environments colonized
With the high flying death-defying flow like the Rebel
Right there, but you're one light year from my level


Uh-huh.. yeah.. yo.. check it.. yo..
Bottles goin' off in the church, we broke the wine
Slapped the pastor, didn't know Pop had asthma
He pulled out his blue bible, change fell out his coat
Three condoms, two dice, one bag of dope
Oooh! Rev. ain't right, his church ain't right
Deacon is a pimp, tell by his ice
Mrs. Parks said, "Brother Starks, meet you at the numbers spot
Heard you got red tops out, and I want a lot"
Shirley fainted dead on the spot
Two ushers slipped eighty dollars right out the pot
Oh shit!


Egyptian, brown skin brown suede Timbs
Masqueradin X-rated throw blades, all occasions
Round nozzle touchdown, Haagen-Daas gobbles White House
Gucci flag on the roof, call us rock groups
Mere intelligent, buy Neimann Marcus out
No doubt, all we saw he bought, Lori mom's all blow
Was simple, blamp instrumentals run camps the stamps get you
The way we lamp, fans come and get you
Play, fullback strapped like a fuck, war at
The black, Carlo Gambino's stash house in Hackensack
Pack capsules, Green Bay 'em lay 'em down like wax do
It's all actual we build, like Crash Crew
Coconut, incense, one sentence, aiyyo
Control the holy flinch hit this, new whips
Roman numerals, sun splash them niggas like, Tango and Cash
Alcatraz cats roll out fast..


Wu thousand nuthin but hardcore
We tryin to get land riches and more
Ghost put me on to it
We just do it, floss or whatever
Take care of the business, there's too many roughnecks
Give two of these to Flex, tell him it's real rap like Ghost
Had to beat niggas with toast
Clubs V.I. clientele we lay it down flat
Pulled out on y'all kid, now where your mans at?
Fakin the real like, "Damn I can't stand Cappa'"
Then my wardrobe flooded the next chapter
Y'all heard about us like we heard about you
Bless the mic with reality, hit you with the virtue
Calm down not tryin to hurt you, burst through
That shit, fatter than all y'all niggas outfits
We the glitch like Y2K
Catch the ball when it drop, guns pop, y'all have a nice day

"Doctor Kanabuta, Iron Man, he is invincible
His remarkable armor is supreme!"


Yo, sometimes I'm liable to spaz and break fool
Grab my gun, select one, snatch son
Put the barrel by his face, blast one by his eardrum
Piss run, you drop thinkin you shot
Screamin like a bitch, kicks to your face
Shots to the body that shake like the bass
I'm Ghostfaced up, military style down
Nuff ammunitions of rounds across the chest


Skip to the intro, rap through po'
Smashed a fresh ball of wax ceasar
Flashy penthouse that overlooks the vista
Wally Moc' half tied, swimmin trunks
Three chunks of ice sit in Johnny Walker for advice
Catch the moment, fundraiser at will, work with the homeless
Polish diamond edge, Flintstone shit, sealed in a comb pick
Carefully, swing the B seven series Christmas lights
Too bright Ghost is comin y'all fix the mirrors
Relax like pudding, confidence strangle my man couldn't
Exile he no longer in the hood
Bless the kid that max the most
Me I turn a wedding into hoax
Roses tied to bombs on posts
On commercial breaks, piss in the apple juice
Rasta nigga rock the big do's
Jiffy Pop it's only chant Wu




"What we're gonna do right here is go back, way back, back into time"
"Here we go!"
"OK everybody!"
"Sing my song" "Step up to this" (Both X4)

Yo, there's a rumor that an inmate heard
Salesman hiring, a convict of murder
Bodyguard, he used to use physical fitness
His business, catching and terrifying the witness
In the gym is where he gained his powers
Boss was the pizzeria owner that rolled flour
A made man, it felt good to be made
Turned murderer, extremely quick to upgrade
But he still baked pies and his cake would rise
Like his enemy, he watched to take dives
Allies would retaliate, at least even the score
Had a thousand guns they would calibrate
He sort a loss, if devil crossed
Moved on 'em swiftly, if worlds away set the shuttle off
Horror in the ville without the Amity
Scars upon the grill of your friend's family
Workers utilized then brutalized
Performance scrutinized then crucified
Wakes, fire bombs, function's shot up
The jakes was not alarmed, but damned is the product


Shooters mans, grizzlies stands up in the GT
Klansman with the sword that'll blow up a van
When the people's come, blow right past
Mind your business, I don't know nothin'
They found his ho in the trash
Barbecue wings, blings for my niggas that's true kings
Sit up in the crib, catch somethin' and screw fiends, yeah
Watchin' me, next time scotch me
I drink Cristal liquor, I'm a version of Hitler
On wax, no 'dacks just water
A du-rag on, I scratch waves sayin' niggas is trash
Yo, learn how to write, beware
I pull up, he here
I should've known I had a clone, see weird niggas'll get irked
Murked, dropped off in a new turf
Trunk full of Siamese rats and gnats yo
I do it for the cats and pits and all the bitches with big tits
Five hundred shoe game switch
Shake that shake, I bake
I live in the state that kill niggas over grits and steak
You might get smacked with a Mac 11
Or run off the road or shot in McDonalds for frontin' with fake niggas


Ay yo, Saladin vivid Wall Street sixteen
Muslims, kufis, uzis, the Wu is supreme
Ferociously I rank general a world's above self
Conspicuous crime make me grab the nine off the shelf
The dark hallways amazingly convenient
The phoenix with Jane, jugglin' cracks or playin' with ninas
Thug law of the streets, gangsters crave the beef to feast
Fiends with plates, a snake wanna eat
Gaze at the spectacular rapper, niggas is Dracula
Rap tours, Priest the hood ambassador
Passion for war, Wu-Massacre, threats, they never worry me
Plots to my death, mic jack conspiracy
Lyrically, I'm only afraid of my own ability
Words that shape into nuclear wars, we shooting through walls
Bringing down the mall, I ring around the store
Planets of the Apes, bandanas on our face
Hammers on our waist, cameras out in space
The nickel plate, fake armor, will harm ya'll snakes

Shake the ground while my beats just break you down
Raw sound, goin' to war right now
So, yo, bombin', We Usually Take All Niggas Garments

PLO Style, buddha monks with the owls
Now who's the fuckin' man? Meth-Tical


On the chessbox
"Wu-Tang style"


I leave the mic in body bags, my rap style has
The force to leave you lost like the tribe of Shabazz
Murderous material made by a madman
It's the mic wrecker, Inspectah, bad man
From the bad lands of the killer
Rap fanatic representin' with the skill that's iller
Dare to compare, get pierced just like your ear
The Shooby Doo-Wop pop, strictly hardware
Armed and geared, 'cause I just broke out the prison
Charged by the system for murderin' the rhythm
Now lo and behold another deadly episode
Bound to catch another fuckin' charge when I explode


Slammin' a hype-ass verse 'til your head burst
I ramshack dead in the track, and that's that
Rap assassin, fast and quick to blast and hardrock
I ran up in spots like Fort Knox
I'm hot, top notch, Ghost thinks with logic
Flashbacks how I attacked your whole project
I'm raw, I'm rugged and raw, I repeat
If I die, my seed'll be ill like me
Approachin' me, yo, out of respect, chops to neck
I get vexed, like crashin' up a phat-ass Lex
So, clear the way! Make way! Yo, open the cage!
Peace, I'm out, jettin' like a runaway slave


You gettin' stripped from your garments, boy, run your jewels
All the meth got me open like fallopian tubes
I bring death to a snake when he least expect
Ain't a damn thing changed, boy, Protect Ya Neck
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah jam is fatal
Quick to stick my Wu-Tang sword right through your navel
Suspenseful force bein' brought through my utensil
The pencil, I bring strong winds up against you
Havoc, then run up through your county like the Maverick
Caps through the tablets, I gots to make the fabrics


A-a-a-ah-ah, are you a warrior killer slicin' shit like a samurai?
The Ol' Dirty Bastard from the bar
Ol' Dirty clan of terrorists
Comin' at your ass like a sorceress, shootin' that piss
Niggas be gettin' on my fuckin' nerves
Rhymes they be kickin'
Make me wanna kick their fuckin' ass to the curb
Boy got funky fresh like the Old Specialist
A carrier, messenger, bury ya
This experience is for the whole experience
Let it be applied, Unique drop that science


M-M-My clan is thick like plaster, bust ya, slash ya
Slit a nigga back like a Dutch Master
Killer, style jumped off in Killa Hilla
I was the thriller in the Ali-Frazier Manila
I came down with phat tracks that combine and interlock
Like gettin' smashed by a cinder block
Pow! Now it's all over; niggas seein' pink hearts
Yellow moons, orange stars, and green clovers




Niggas on the left, brag shit to death
Now hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, c'mon and attract to what
Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, brag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, c'mon and attract to what
This goes back to nineteen..

The force to leave you lost, like the tribe of Shabazz
Murderous material, made by a madman
It's the mic wrecker, Inspector, bad man
From the bad lands of the killer, rap fanatic
Representing with the skill that's iller
Dare to compare, get pierced just like an ear
The zoo-we-do-wop-bop strictly hardware
Armed and geared cause I just broke out the prison
Charged by the system - for murdering the rhythm!
Now, lo and behold, another deadly episode
Bound to catch another fuckin charge when I explode


Slammin a hype-ass verse til ya head burst
I ramshack dead in the track, and that's that
Rap assassin, fastin, quick to blast and hardrock
I ran up in spots like Fort Knox!
I'm hot, top notch, Ghost thinks with logic
Flashback's how I attacked your whole project
I'm raw, I'm rugged and raw! I repeat, if I die
My seed'll be ill like me
Approachin me, you out of respect, chops ya neck
I get vexed, like crashing up a phat-ass Lex'
So clear the way, make way, yo! Open the cage
Peace, I'm out, jettin like a runaway slave


Ya gettin stripped from ya garments, boy, run ya jewels
While the meth got me open like falopian tubes
I bring death to a snake when he least expect
Ain't a damn thing changed, boy, Protect Ya Neck
Ruler Zig Zag, Zig-Allah jam is fatal
Quick to stick my Wu-Tang sword right through ya navel
Suspenseful, plus bein bought through my utensil
The pencil, I break strong winds up against your
Abbot, that run up through your county like the Maverick
Caps through the tablets, I gots to make the fabrics


Are uh-ah-uh Are you a warrior? Killer? Slicin shit like a samurai
The Ol' Dirty Bastard from the bar
Ol' Dirty clan of terrorists
Comin atcha ass like a sorceress, shootin' that PISS!
Niggas be gettin on my fuckin nerves
Rhymes they be kickin make me wanna kick they fuckin ass to the curb
I got funky fresh, like the old specialist
A carrier, messenger, bury ya
This experience is for the whole experience
Let it be applied, and THEN DROP THAT SCIENCE


My my my
My Clan is thick like plaster
Bust ya, slash ya
Slit a nigga back like a Dutch Master Killer
Style jumped off and Killa, Hill-er
I was the thriller in the Ali-Frazier Manilla
I came down with phat tracks that combine and interlock
Like getting smashed by a cinder block
Blaow! Now it's all over
Niggas seeing pink hearts, yellow moons
Orange stars and green clovers



 (GZA)
Yo, yo one two one two, yo live in effect
We got the king Ruler Zig-Zag-Zag Allah
Commonly known to y'all as the RZA
Yo before we go into side two or side B of this double CD
Knahmsayin I want to give y'all a little announcement man
For the last year there's been a lot of music comin out
The shit been weak, knowhatI'msayin?
A lot of niggas trying to take hip-hop
And make that shit R&B, rapping bullshit yaknowhatI'msayin?
Or make that shit funk
Fuck that, this is MCin right here, this is hip-hop
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang gonna bring it to you in the purest form
I got the GZA on my side, Killah Priest
Sunz of Man, Royal Fam, Killarmy, Gravediggaz, 12 O'Clock
Yo, we want to let y'all niggas know somethin man
To my people all across the world; Japan, Europe -- knowhatI'msayin?
Canada, knowmean -- Austria, Germany, Sweden
Yo, this is true hip-hop you listenin to right here
In the pure form, this ain't no R&B with a wack nigga takin the loop
Be loopin that shit thinkin it's gonna be the sound of the culture
YaknowhatI'msayin? (That player bullshit)
YaknowhatI'msayin? All that player dressin up
On this shit, actin like this some kind of fashion show man
YaknowhatI'msayin? This is hip-hop right here
YaknowhatI'msayin? This is lyrics, MCin
And yo, to y'all niggas who think you going to become an MC overnight
YaknowhatI'msayin? Better snap out that fuckin dream
Man it takes years for this you Cat in the Hat ass rappers
You Dr. Seuss, Mother Goose, simple minded
(Stop runnin up on niggas with all that wack shit)
Word up man (talking bout "you MC")
You ain't no MC; niggas ain't made for this yaknowhatI'msayin?
This shit was Only Built 4 Cuban Linx -- we told y'all niggas back then
And then everybody wanted to change their motherfuckin name
YaknowhatI'msayin? We come out with a style
Now everybody wanna imitate our style and all you producers out there
YaknowhatI'msayin? It's all good to show love to a nigga
But stop bitin my shit, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Come from your own heart with this shit
And all y'all MC's, stop biting from my niggas
We told ya'll niggas on the fucking Cuban Linx album
Don't bite our shit, y'all niggas keep biting
Yo, I'm going to tell y'all something man
It's time for the Wu revolution right here
To all my niggas across the world
Raise your motherfucking fist in the air
And get ready for the Triumph
Cause the Gods is here to take over this shit
Word up, peace




From the slums of Shaolin, to the dungeons of the 36 Chambers
{Good, Wu-Tang Martial Expert}
(Straight up and down) we now bring you, Cilvaringz
{Good, Wu-Tang Martial Expert}
Wu-Tang Martial Expert (this is all gutter shit)
Now shadowbox with this real rapper (we in the building, nigga)
{They say he's a swordsman, to me, it seems he can't use a sword}


I wrote the album in sincerity, GZA, you feeling me?
Cuz if they bombing for peace, I'm like fuck her for virginity
See I'm that Killa Bee, I'm back up on it
I'll attack and sting everything that's corporate
Plus the fake, everything stay cornered til I'm done
And ride back straight to my office
In '99, I struck deals with RZA, build with RZA
A natural on top, that can't be shot
So poverty never became my topic
And followed politics and the became obnoxious
So now I'm Chuck, I'm Nas, I'm BP, I'm Slim
I'm Technique wrapped in one CD
Freely inspired by life itself
Trying to speak real issues, it might just help
From the Wu-Tang Clan, Martial Expert
Taking care of vein with the sword, where your neck's hurt
The knowledge verse with that I attack first
It's da-da-da-da-da-da, could it get that worse?


Aiyo, the 36 Chambers of Death
How many ways can we devise to kill a man?
The sword thrust, palm strike
Poison tip knife, go across his head with a metal pipe
You are being injected with a high frequency
Piercing through your brain
(If you should lose it, you're finished)
It's hard to maintain, nigga!


You see them Arabs, they hooked on 50, they go to rehab
They come back yelling, Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Jihad!
They wanna lay back, and bounce in clubs
I said a life's so dark? Take these darts as lightbulbs
Switch it, reality's ugly
And ignorant mentalities bug me, it's rugby
Trying to get your points across, you get fucked up
Trying to get your joints in stores, you get fucked up
Trying to make some noise against war, you get locked up
Try to get your voice to be heard, you get shot up
And those who fear God, will not fear death
And so I went and got, RZA, GZA and Meth
Plus I went and got, Ghost, Killa and Chef
Have 'em speak on fire beats while I co-wrote the rest
So I don't care if you write, I swing it to the left
And I don't care if you dislike my writing exact
I'm that real, slay me now, prototype
That you dislike, recline and Dolomite
Get my shit right...


Good, Wu-Tang Martial Expert
Good, Wu-Tang Martial Expert
Good, Wu-Tang Martial Expert
Good, Wu-Tang Martial Expert
His technique was perfect




Listen to our music altogether
You don't need keep it on so check it
Yourself to your musician shake it up
Shake it down, when you're grounded for the month
Trying to get you too
Stay awake till you do want it, you know me??
Stay out of control, not of your own business
Listen up to your mouth
Keep listen up to your mouth, leading through the door slam thor
Not shall be do it for me and you are a pretty romantic shown
Perfectly our mentality problems, better off quickly you come do me
I got you back later, when you're so scream out tooth runtime
Punchline, bloodline, listen up your music
Kitty kitty cat was pretty awesome
Self destruct the mat when you'll call you up either
Right now looks like a girls right
Draw me cow like how bud than chocolate
Take our planets of the moon, heeya!
See you in later, what did you think
Liar? Don't call me a liar! I'm sorry for ask you in later
Wash me blind washed out off our streets
Looked likes Sedan need to pack starring off the film jewels
Look the robots gone, huh? No ones calls out
Huh? Look out of my sisters
Of all out of you tell me the truth no ones looking
About the streets of masters
Come do me, just me and you baby
Listen to your own music to call you
Out of your schools, that's nice and pretty
Not of your own business see you too
Get outta here right now
Buy you can't stay with me!?
Prepare stressed, crying, screaming and rude to me
And you're so disgusting, horrid, stupid and nightmare


Listen madam, you come do me
Listen baby, you come do me


Oh yeah? You come do me too
Or I come do you too
My friend Sam Fuel, it is long time ago
All of us, all of you to do with it
