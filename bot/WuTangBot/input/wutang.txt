Yo, yo, Iron Chef, gracias
I need some of that, slide through the back
I need ya'll to come back to the, I heard juice
Back of the store over here, just be easy and tell ya man to be cool
We got some culinary cats right here, we need you we'll kill him if he fault


Aiyo, rappers steppin' to me, they want a brick son
But I'm the Chef, my price is twenty-six son
Move up, about thirty-two of those and open locker dough
Soldier got locked up, blow killed the doctor
Flamboyant police is X fives, watchin' my lofts
So many leeches I just left it and walked
My flow wicked, Miami money, movin' and ridicule
Geico on the arm froze, rose gold with me
Take baths with white women, lingerie see-through
Takin' trips to Iran, my Spanish nigga peoples
Sellin' drugs to Flatbush, call my nigga Cecil
Snub with the black gloves, on half-moon Greek do
Killed him in the Bahamas, his wife ran white van pulled up
They caught him out in Brooklyn with a white man
Slutted out, rosed out, sister was gone, she geekin'
She threw the rifle in her mouth and said good evenin'
Yup, Paul Wall grill line, be getting money, crime thief
I know her from Africa, pretty smile, nine teeth
Gold joints, frames only, Louis Vuitton, pony
Leather with the matching sweater on, you owe me


Knock the ash off the blunt, confront niggas who cunt
Swing an ax, tax niggas rhyme different from cats
Specialize in mic rippers, splashes
We the last skippers, big rocks and the block will stick


Beefsteak Charlie niggas eat and they get fat
Chase heads up and down the block and kill rats
Skilled with the gats, even feds don't know where the shells at
The shell trapped up in nice crib with four packs
Four macs, caught a nice sale for four stacks
Yeah, me and my nigga Arafat
Gotta escape but we'll be right back, real soon
Chef cook it up, we got a date with real goons
Telling you Ghost, my connect crazy with the wet
Might know him used to talk to his sister named Yvette
I speed it up, me and the Linx, was getting weeded up
I beat it up, yeah I hit that, but I ain't seed it up
Meanwhile, back on the block, we seen two trucks
Then the windows rolled down, we see these two fucks
Soon as they jumped out, see these tools bust




Yeah, yo, I lit a boogah up, rocks is gone, so we baggin' up all shape
Binoculars, scanners, we all listen to jake
Ran out of baggies, my mouth is dry
Got them dirty joints that scatter, don't act surprised
Nah, nigga the currency rushes like popping a wheelie
Holding a pipe with one hand, the other countin' the billies
You know how it be with the peppermint Clarks, throwing darts at a hoodrat
Getting slow neck up in The Bronx
That's all me, thirty four shines, forty four lines
I just chill like Aaron Hall, writin' raw rhymes
Like, threw Kool-Aid rubies in a lemonade bezzle
When I was twelve in the church, I started packin' that metal
A deuce-deuce, my supplier was Loose Bruce
Ever since I had the drop, my instinct was to shoot-shoot
This ain't For the Love of Ray J, it's for the love of the AK
Cuz you can get scratched like AJ
Cuban Link Dynasty has emerged, this rap shit stop
I have a team of niggas moving my furs






16th Chamber, temple number five


Somebody said it's on, if it is then I'll be set
To blow a nigga up, with my Five Fingers of Death
I bring it to his whole damn fam, understand
If he frontin, on any man down with the Clan
I be comin, for that headpiece you can't cope
For my brother, I even kill a Pope, word to mother
Serial, killa, style from the Isle of Stat
My peoples are you with me where you at?
Shit's gettin deep in here, I mean like thick
Niggas lookin all in my face like they want dick
It's about to hit the fan, hit the flo'
That's all I can stands, and I can't stands no mo'
What is it? Niggas think they bigga
Because they got the finga on the trigga of a biscuit
They don't know I'm wicked, when I start to kick it
With the raw sound, wash it down with a Mystic
Better yet a Snapple, nigga want the juice
But he don't want the hassle
Thought they trying to overthrow the castle
Better yet the temple, I'm comin to your town
Black down, the rental, car, the pistol
YAH! If you don't want a burn from Glock
Then beware, I buck shots, meaning what, the buck stops
Here, no more dough will be made
Unless it's being made by who... the 1-6-Ooh

 + (Method Man)
Chamber four (1-6-Ooh) Chamber four
Temple number nine, temple number nine


I'm the original G-O-D
Making young ladies scream is my specialty
When I go ooh-wah, ooh-wah, ooh-wah, girls wanna get hype
From the funky fresh music that was stereotyped
When I kill, that ol' mad rugged flow
Not sayin Ason, is like a duck of disco
Or a disco duck, I'm strictly hip hop
Yo, Ason, what's up? I can't stop...
Wu-Tanging, flipping the script and
You could test my skills, but niggas must be trippin
Coked up from sniffin, you're the one who's riffin
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
You start to flip, now ya slip, cuz you're slippin
While you sleep I be the God on point, like Scottie Pippen
As I, jump on stage, cold flip a rip a show
Strip or rip a ho, ready like Bo
Jackson while I'm still taxin, I'm maxin
Relaxin, sittin backs and, laying tracks and
Again and again when I rock this jam
I wanna see 'em up in the air, throw up your hand
Introducin, the one-man band
A child that's wild, now with the style, couldn't stand
Niggas wanna jump, then stepped, to the center
Of the rhyme inventor, MC tormentor
You get jacked and slapped, across the MC map
I laugh at ya ass, on a horse shack
Come on through I black and blue your whole crew
Then I get rudie with the Hong Kong Phooey
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, MC killer
Money maker, Brooklyn, Shaolin style
That I lay down like tile
Gotta hit you up, one blaow, so you better come down...




I live life lavish and my chain is karats
The last name on the train to Paris
Used to be lame then attained the merit
So many clothes can't name the fabrics
Dynamics, I want the fame
And my name engraved in granites
Here's his lane, now came to grab it
You moving sideways, change your habits
Used to rock minks, then I changed to rabbit
From out the garbage, I came from average
Used to be righteous that changed to savage
Bang my ratchet like Bangkok Dangerous
36 Chamber fist Trianglist
Watch me mangle this Star Spanglist
Rock cowboy Wrangler creating mega-hits
I'm from the grain Game at my fingertips


Yeah! Killa Hill lay it down!
Killa Bees on the swarm!
Nigga


Ayyo I plow down ? like I'm out for revenge
Fuck it, it seems like the drama never ends
Be in the projects like I never left out
Might be on Osgood, see a nigga stretched out
I can't take it seems like my hood is cursed
Bad niggas, I thought that the good was first
My old whore, she march with a foul parade
Don't learn shit til another child is sprayed
I'm out here, fuck it, like I live on ? and Rico
Keep a low cut like Margie
I don't give a fuck, y'all made me bitter
I'ma whip your kids out like a babysitter
I'ma grown man but I'm young in the mind state
Live in every borough but New York my tri-state
Test me you know I brought a bitch on the tour bus
Pour piss on you, leave you stuck for 4 months
My head fucked up, I'm off my clean streak
Don't make me pick the 9's up, I come from mean streets
My unit snitched on me, ratted me out
They all ganged up on me, tried to take my mouth
However the cause I'm in jail and get bent
They cut from dirty cloth, I'm cut from cement
Original , got the crazy glow
Them devils tried to jump me, I'm crazy though
Absolut Vodka rat crush mad Goose
O.G. all day like I be on the deuce
Pop off with it, get your army in order
Staten Africa, Islam, across that water


Yeah
Told 'em "Have Gun--Will travel"
Blowing earth metals, black son spill gravel
Bronze Man oblong javelins in my cabinet
Detroit cement salutations from the missile plant
Quick to the hollowpoint, it ain't no olive branch
My low-cal 4 0 cal. in the cardigan
Tempted by Satan put a bullet in his diaphragm
Walk around black clouds and quiet violins
A tire fire blends poet and violent pens
Illest skill, got steel plots and iron winds
Uphill need a ghetto spill, the sirens sing
Street dreams. black season, inspired kings
For fire water veins, still rain Listerine
They chains through to my "Roots", no doubt Ben Verne
On the road to riches and diamond speech
I might turn a bag of white sand in mountain peaks


I don't text to send messages
My testosterone stimulate her estrogen
Whether Black, Caucasian or the Mexican
Asian, she get the message and she coming back for sex again
Organic drugs
My natural persuasion
You under the influence of 36 invasion
Spider-man amazing but I'm darker then Parker
Skin got abrasions from Arya and Tasha
Sliding down the street cold
Pull up to your party stimulated with a Jeep full
Of jerry gap honeys and bottles of vodka
Plus the weed rolls, here we go
Mediating, never jealous, over zealous
Wu Tang's my fellowship
Fans mash up accapellas of our lyrics with Beatle tracks embellishes
The idea clearly that Wu-Tang forever
This way of life is art, rhymes and cleverness
Joined by God no man can sever this
I complete jobs free and effortless
Use tiger crane, snake style plus the leopard fist




We will fight till the night is done
We will live our lives tonight as one
We will live our lives tonight as one, one


I'm a bad mother, shut your mouth
Insanity, DVD, how I stretch 'em out
What the stress about? INS best out
Fact, you knew that before he left the house
Fresh at the produce section
Gaze at my shine like a showroom necklace
Death wish, stepping in Deck's direction
I'm checking niggas like test questions


Across 110th now, cross Belmont and Montauk
Camera hawk hawks the sidewalk
When they get to flexing muscle niggas bust you
Hustlers do you, gave you your first toolie
Cutting out of school to pump your first loose leaf
Think graduate to wait, take it out of state, duct tape
Anything of pulse and heroin
Emcees frozen, cuban link chains are golden
I'm ownin' everywhere I'm holdin' it up, to keep it raw
Math here, I got 'em keep coming back for more


Yo, man, I'm so turned up, all the marijuana burned up
Y'all don't want the drama, word up
The Wu first up, the game is the world versus us
Y'all was good 'til the world heard us
Y'all ain't want them Clan birds up
Y'all don't want your man served up, that'll get the fans worked up
Homie really wanna play, stir it up
I'mma catch me a wave, surfs up
Gliding on the track like this, make me wanna act like this
Make me wanna smack that trick
Make a killer really wanna yap that kid
If he opens up his yap that's it




Mass of minerals in a glass house
Playing 4th the Wu neutrinos will blast out
Letting out verbal thunder bolts
Until the world attract old and younger folks
Charge with the vitality of magnetism
In large reality with massive rhythm
The manual without technical part
From the beginning give off an electrical spark


I respect you if you respect me
Everything's for real, WTC
No fake ass shit, don't front the Remy
Break bread, never have pockets empty
Let's get it, flip it up then we can spend it
The money train, Killa Beez on your brain
W's everywhere, one on your chain
Homeboys for life, please don't change
You can hide at my house, it ain't no thing
If you see the pigs, don't say jack
Call me original, don't say cap
I'm on the low, might be at the murder
Holding off the place y'all cats never heard of
Yeah, chicks wanna peep me out
Nasty ass, want me to pee in their mouth
But now I'm out, about to link with sticks




Bang a few notes up top, we call it beast mode
Forget the street codes, show you like a deep throat
It gets rougher, you suffer from the heat stroke
Blast barrels, embrace my leaf smoke
Park Hillians radio for back up
Polish your act up, nigga need a back up
Syrup in my cup, no cut, straight up
UG's on the court, never miss a lay up


When the emcees came to live out their names
Some rode the bus, some rode the train
Some motherfuckers wish they never came
When they met the nine swordsmen of Wu-Tang
Nine Maseratis pulls up to this party hard
Body, the party is filled with Godbody
There out of shape models coming through with those bottles
And double D's please, all eyes follow
Pass me a bucket of ice, that's nice
Hit with the vodka, what you say proper
I drink with the copper, show up in a chopper
Stop her, she wanna have a mnage  trois
I can tell by the bra, RZA Ra-KZA-Keem is all is Allah
Do you wish or wish upon a star? Do you wish or wish upon a star?






Yeah, start wit that one
Yo, yo, yo


My acoustic pugilistic lingustic rap fabric
Is a mixture of Arabic, Sanscrit, English, italics
I talk quick, y'all bitches can't comprehend my dick release spit
But love should I release hits
We travel through bodies like blood vessels
While y'all crab niggas try to wrestle to be on top of this pedestal
Slang doctrine, minoxin, lyrical toxin, I'm chessboxin
Words is rushin through like a herd of angry oxen


Fatal for these pussy cat niggas is dead weight
Concentrate, my murder rate excellerate, terminate
So spoil like coke in the foil
Knock knock, I shot the whole block
Electricity, flow splendidly
Internally inside of me like Tony Starks tee
I create excellency, one-sixty call L-O-U-N-G assist me
Papi wardrobe is key, roll promptly
For slang hall, vocabulary Igor, Frankenstein mind
Rewind for a minute while I dig down your track, stupid
I move quick shit is accurate, Kojack tactics
Chaos, killa bee minds, high society blackness, spread the rumor


My lyrical marvel makin more cream than Carvel
Y'all niggas best to hold your weight like barbell
To my verbal swordsman school, students don't play truant
My most prudent pupil, rhyme under influence
Of alcohol and tobacco, mushrooms imported from Morocco
Bellies on the rocks and a twenty sack of choco
With forty tales and gold around the fist, bitch I carve
Lyrics on the paper so my family won't starve


I'm deep in the shit, I stay highly involved
Never in-conceited, never been beated
Been trapped in many wars but not yet retreated
My style you need it, I just write to read it
It's all fresh lyric, no nothing gets repeated
I came a long way and guess what, I succeeded
I conquer my opponent and feed him baby food
'Cause he's childish and illiterate and ye has been rude
To the father year me, O-R-I-G
Respond to the war with the Killa Bee law


Scavenger nigga, you's a shrimp
A full line of shit, my ear can digest it
Stop drinking all that water, let's take it to the land
So I can Godzilla up your shit mister Tiny Tim man
Niggas be creeping up my beanstalk
When I start to come down on your fucking ass
You tried to chop shit on up
Played my shit like parks bitch, I'm that


Legendary microphone's weaponry
You secondary bitch ass fairies
Scary cats won't survive this verbal attack
You think you're slang can match
The Wu-Tang, emphatically now cypher
You fake crumbs, you should be stung on your tongue
While you young guns bunge, we plunge into the grunge
Deep into the dark dungeon, we come in one wind
Nine minds combine to form the wisest rhyme force to summon
I be the quoted mathematical combination
Unloading mysteries of life, you feel my solar wind blowing


Just then, I came on the stage like wind
Blew slang in your face and it touch your skin
You felt chilly, just like you smoked a bag of illy
You need a coat just to protect your throat
Two pairs of socks, kid I'm cold like ice rocks
Chap-lipped duds can't fuck with the chatterbox
Cherry heads felt the draft of the ox
Shaolin niggas all fuck with one block..
They forgot about the big Cappa slang murderer
Down with the union big street sling murderer
Terrorizing, move I'm tranquilizing
Fast getaway wit the slow speed driving
Two miles an hour, Cappa do it wit the power
Somebody blow something, cut fool in the tower




Bob Digi, U G.O.D, Raekwon the Chef, the Inspectah Deck
M.E.T.H.O.D., the B.O.B.B.,
Straight up, Masta Killa, the GZA/The Genius

 W-T-C
 That's right
 Ya know what I mean?
 GHOST-FACE KILLAH!
 Lemme give y'all the bullshit hook for y'all niggas
Check it out...


The burners and the stash, we 'bout the cash
We got females that got it like that
The golden childs that bone the crowd
See, niggas in the place that bit my style
Well, I'm a singer, dancer, we bulletproof brothers
Wu-Tang got the answer
Cause if I had a chance to do it again
I will still keep the heat in my pants-uh


Y'all be nice to the crackheads, everybody listen up
I shot one of my bitches, the ho ain't trick enough
Word life to big screen Don, tapping dustbones out
With starwriters like I fucked Celine Dion
Stuck everything that's the god's honest beyond
We airin' niggas out, that's the type shit that we on
Official Wu-Tang headbanger
Flood your space with big waves like you did in Sri Lanka


I drink heavy gallons of cru, play the big part
Niggas got squid on the grill, selling kids Clarks
Finesse notes, yo, the Guess on with the vest pose
Yellow swede one matching hat with the grey gun
Niggas be rhymin' for nothing, then my team pull up
We all throw down y'all broke niggas stay frontin'
Lines come digital stupid, plus ain't got no jewelry on
Bet I'm still live and I'm coopin'
Two of my silverbacks run through a pack of your wolves
Front on react, we're sippin' Cognac  relax dude
Know I'm with these cracks dude


Yo, 1-2, Dirt McGirt
Solid tone smith with 6th shots, lick shots
Leave your head like a Shaolin monk with 6 dots
Brooklyn Zoo, Zoo
Brooklyn Zoo


It's the return of Bin Laden, grab your armor
Smash pretty boy niggas, crush their karma
Eat bones with alligators, roll deep with my entourage
My whole crew's fresh out the bars
Diggler AKA the Cab Driver
Drop him off in the middle of fire
Dirty Island, drag bodies to the Murderland
Knock niggas out hurtin' my hand


I remember in the elevator we was playin' corners
Now we play the corners and the cops is stayin' on us
Staten's where the war is
Where the court system's running out of warrants
Where TNT be jumping out the Taurus
For real I can't call it
You see I love Lucy cause she Lawless
Exactly like that 1-0-3-0-4 is
Snitch niggas swallow your tongue
Already know the island I'm from
And y'all don't want no problems with them


We got a history full of lightning victories
Conceptual breakthrough, it ain't no mystery
Long vision from giants in every way
Rap czars, magnificent flows for every day
From the East to the 'ville, from the West to the hills
Incredible rhymes, encouraging skills
From rat packs, the smallest crews were enormous
We hit 'em fast with an effortless performance
MCs start fleeing in flocks
Especially those that's more sensitive to heat and shock


We grindin' down to the bone, my name grounded in stone
I'm Mr. Violence we loungin' with chrome
Mr. Violence we lounge in his home, hit the housing on Rome
Shining like a hundred thousand in stones
Move mountains with poems, got a jones for dinero
1-6-zero my songs we throwin' elbows
The hoes cling, sho thing, we know kings
Only dime dikes with minds right, we choose Queens


Yeah, we wild like rockstars who smash guitars
Yo son split his face with the toast, he ain't ghost
It's no joke iron coat rifle with the stroke
One toke brains float, shot to the throat
Before the smoke hit, witness the killing, chilling crime scene
Body on the block, eyes open from the shock
Of being popped in the neck
Yet he still held a lit cigarette between his fingers
Danger when you step into the chamber with the Masta
Disaster, gotta blast ya cause I have to


The rat pack is back from the island of Stat'
Leave you cursed dust, cause you worship the Gat
The first one to snap drunk off the Smirnoff
Blow the bouncer's ear off, let him floss he the boss
Handcuffed, to the turntables like Wizard Theodore
See it's pure, let it rain pearly ounces
Bang him with the thing that hang from the trousers
You don't want no drama, I'm flaming fast
That nigga jumped up and did the Damon Dash




Yo, this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
For all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it

Yo, in the housing, thousands seen early graves
Victims of worldly ways, memories stays engraved
All my live brothers, is locked down with high numbers
The young hunger, blind to these lies, they die younger
In this New World the Order slaughter men, women, and children
Ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in
The projects, lifeless like a vietnam vet
Constant war, sever threats of enemy conquest
Crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble
Streets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble
Vivid thoughts, Devils resort to trick knowledge
They kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars
I know the pain the game bring, I did the same thing
Spaced out in the staircase, performing a sting
It's hard to keep control, I bless those who seek a scroll
Trying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
Not a role model, I walk a hard road to follow
I sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
The gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole
Mentally they fold, and they eventually sold
Their life and times, deadly like the virus design
But too, minute to dilute, the scientist mind


You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way


A voice cries from the wilderness of the North
A representation of the families that lost one
All victims of incarceration
Or other divisions of the family structure
Youths are injected with serums that leads
To skin irritations, babies being born with
Disfigurations, experimentations
On their faces there bear worry-ations
Of mothers that carry the pain
Of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
Fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
It lightly begins to rain screams of terror
Are hidden by the passing trains
This can't be little Hussein, his uncle cried
As he drops to his nephew's side, holding his cane
Just give me a name, of who has inflicted this
Bitter sickness, and left us to witness


Yeah, yo
Curses from war, innocent blood spills for days
Soothe in godly ways, hands, solemn in praise
Tree of life, more precious than rubies, golden game
The wise shall flourish inherit, Halls of Fame
Crime visions in my blood got me, locked in prison
While we die hard living people whine about religion, vision
Blow, spin, and sin and killing what's revealing
It's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen
Zero process, progress, become the hunted
America's most wanted, good life flaunted, want it
Some love the speed, some satisfy a need
Some want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed
The strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed
One flew astray, and it caught my little seed
Can it be, the ice savage, trife life, made me grab the knife
The righteous man was beat with many stripes, pipes
Take in my energy, breath and know the rest
Cause the good die young and the hard die best


You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way


Y'all bitches love dances, and pulling down your pants
While your man's on tour, your spending up his advances
Your friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke, and suck dick
The whole projects is trapped in stench
You either high school drop-outs, one to three cop-outs
Fifteen years old, shorty ass and top out
Ninety-nine cent beer drinking pussy stinking
Fucking so much your ass and titties start shrinking
New World Order slave trade, minimum wage, Medicaid
Can a devil fool a Muslim nowadays
Inside my lab, I'm going mad
Took two drags off the blunts, and started breaking down the flag
The blue is for the Crips, the red is for the Bloods
The whites for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs
Or the slugs that ignites, through the night, by the dawn
Early light, why is sons fighting for the stripe


As we dwell through this concrete hell, calling it home
Mama say, take your time young man and build your own
Don't wind up like your old dad
Still searching for them glory days he never had
So many bad want to scheme for American dream, no more kings
The cash rule everything now, we going down
These babies looking up to us, it's up to us
The Million Man March MC's, get on the bus
But envy, greed, lust, and hate, separate
Though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
No longer, brothers, we unstable
Like Kane when he slew Abel, killing each other


You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way




Wake up... wake up
Wake up...


Wake up, get a hold of your life, go get your cake up
The motto in the streets is you eat, or you get ate up
Straight up, you tired of waiting, go get your weight up
My peoples tired of waiting for reparations to pay us
Screaming Jesus can save us, I, I get the Bentley if I save up
But that's just another trick to enslave us
Push the minimum wages
Put, put our fathers up in them cages
Then watch out when mother struggled to raise us
But, but my ambition won't let me live in this poor condition
That doesn't care about color, creed, or your religion
Priests, politicians gotta listen to opposition
From my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in
From my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in


Allah said to save the babies from the cold
Pour wisdom in the cup so the truth overflows
Still, knowledge is that bread that keeps us well-fed
Old time religion will not bring us satisfaction
Without action now who can disagree with me?
God is not a mystery, there's nowhere in history
That you could show and prove to me
But still you face east and nod your head to me religiously
I'm G-O-D, to infinity, for real


The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me


Poor reparations, the Bush administration
Unequality, martial law, segregation
False hood, false teaching, false education
Now's the time for us to come amongst this nation
They deceiving us, they don't believe in us
They believe in that Cream like Julius Caesar
I'm like Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X with the heaters
Ripping the chains of the remains of all of the leaders
Never worship the image of evil swine eaters
I'm on the back of the bus with two fine divas
We in the jungle of life, but never jungle fever
I'm God-body all day long, spiritual life lessons
That I recite in this song
Trying to wake up everybody, can't we all get along?
For all my people that's out there persevering through the storm
Black fist, Staten Island, stand up, stand strong
Penetrate through the gate and bring the Clan along


The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me


Wake up and realise the times
That we living in the world is getting more iller than ever
Thought we was chillin', striving change for the better
But it was a dream like Martin Luther
He had a vision that could move a mountain
Protect one another, that's world to my brother Malcolm
As-salamu alaykum, alaykum as-salam
We want justice, police supposed to protect and serve
And then they shoot us down like wild animals
The nerve of them cold-hearted killers
With blue suits slaying our black youth
The earth cries from all the blood that's being spilled
We need a solution fast, get InshAllah bill
Let me educate them, translate it meaning God's will
It goes all in together, together how we are
To stand with a plan, provided we down to fall
And that's the Willie Lynch tactics that separated the masses
Taught us all to think backwards




The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me

We gonna change the world (x5)

Yo, yo, the A-1 sauce, the Divine Force
My mind blind force is known to blow time off course
Even, if I rode around the world on a blind horse
Strapped down, I'd still get my point across
Allah is father of all
You debate whether big, whether small
Whether short, whether tall
Whether dense, whether length
Whether strength, whether width
Either man, animal, bird or fish
Whether, black or white, more shapes than snowflakes
Existin', everywhere but you still can't locate
The man of steel couldn't bend me
Time couldn't end me
Even the great devil Satan that tried to befriend me
Understand the equality, God in a bodily form
Lettin' my knowledge be born
Lettin' my knowledge be born

"I wanna stay with you, forever"


Yo, yo, yo
I be the fatal flyin', I'm like NATO flyin'
Over your country and droppin' down forty tons of iron
Filled with explosives, your chance is hopeless
We have your head poppin' up like the blowfish
I'm not talkin' Hootie, nigga pass the zootie
I could bag the cootie, maybe smoke the ootie
The runaway train with no track
I got the heart of Faye Dunaway whippin' that child with the coatrack
T.V. droppin' bombs or droppin' germs
Baby moms in the courthouse, she's droppin' terms
Guns go off, bustin' all directions
D.J. choose, another fuckin' dope selection

"With you forever"
"Like the corners of my mind"
"I wanna stay with you, forever"


Yo, the pen is mightier than the sword, as I face my worldly challenge
In the scale of justice and my heart remains balanced and neutral
My respect for all men is mutual
As my thoughts surpass a level to which you devils compute to
You've been given the chance to hear the true and living
So do the knowledge, son, before you do the wisdom
So you can understand, how the thunder and
Lightning above your head is caused by the Son of Man
We experimentin' with high explosions
That cause the place to quake and the surface erosions
The earth produce lava like the mouth produce saliva
This wisdom goes deeper than your scuba diver
In search for the pearl jewels sold to Tiffany
My verbal heart symphony will strike the epiphany
Insight, ignite, and then men might, see love and hell
Hell and right, then excel, to be masters of your circumference
First, by obtainin' mastery of your common sense
This supreme wisdom clears a man's vision
You can see it through the lies and the phantasm
Of the equivocal, two-faced political individual
Who's only out for residual, fabricatin' lies
To eradicate the wise
But we come to civilize and gravitate to the skies
Of the heavenly celestial sphere
Trust me, son, it's dear, in between your ears


A day to God is a thousand years
Men walk around with a thousand fears
The true joy of love bring a thousand tears
In the world of desire, there's a thousand snares

"I wanna stay with you forever"




Yeah, yeah, a special guest appearance
From the slums.... yo, aiyo


I examine your diameter, third eye light the camera up
Be careful, I got four ninjas, inside your parameter
Perimeter, flame burst out all sides like Gamora
My poisonous is released, gas from the canister
Raise the black fist, we keep the earth on it's axis
I make a good day move slow like molasses
Welcome to the bee hive, dual processor with the G5
There's not a tape or disco break I can't revive
In this high tech world of fire wire and microchip
We still keep the four-five clip, filled with the spiral tip


I come from the 36 Chambers of danger
With many lyrical swordsmen, that quick to change ya
The difficulty to see closely, is mostly
It's a critical point, when ya rap niggas approach me
Like the blind, deaf, dumb, who mind was left numb
A non B-Boy nigga, couldn't rhyme to the drum
When I started M.C.'ing I entered, the gates of pleasure
Not knowing, I be coming with, too much to measure
With the math of an elder, and the steel of a welder
The path of tray, that I had laid down, to held a
Blueprint, that would draw attention like the Pope
I examine all with the internal mirror of the scope


Supreme deluxe edition, CREAM with a touch of wisdom
Beams that through up the system, spleens, I conduct, you listen
How you gonna tell me no, yo, the fuck you is in
Locked in a four block radius like a public prison
Twenty two year old, dunn, ain't got a cup to piss in
But he got a barrel gun, and that's knuckle twitching
And he got a baby moms and a cousin bitching
Went to catch a body, now he stuck in another prison


When you see it, you better acknowledge, your all swords
Blaze the green hundred fours
Pull out on you, blew you for the cause
And Sudan outst a nigga, seclude you from my Clan
This is water Glock, aces on cameras sniffin' raw
Why try to fuck with these lecturers
I'm so high powered, my electrical structure blew down the floor
You was king for a second, I reigned, came with a different name
The W.T.C. Family and more, one!


They applause when I make my entrance
I move on 'em with age and experience, before I start the sentence
The rhyme was designed to meet most demand
Is enough to compensate, fertilize the land
He blew out the belt drive, M.C.'s they felt vibes
Powerful dart, narrowly missing your whole tribe
Scientists look, at the magnitude and devastation
But the strands of heavy metal seem to have no relation
But it's always potential for large scale disasters
Because the instrumentals, spins a hundred times faster
Many was taken, is at the price of a pawn
And the collective lost had left, thousand of mourn
Them Clansmen, are the nucleus of hip-hop
There's no room for error, M.C.'s will get dropped
Evidence of terrifying threats from heat pressure
Power by strong winds that blew rhymes off the dresser
The words spread through the town from Yonkers to Leffers
And to kill off the slang was a city wide effort
But they couldn't be more wrong, my click was all strong
Fit together seamlessly, til you're all gone


The queen by far, is the strongest piece
Should too, should not be prematurely brought
Into play, during in the opening
Or she will be attacked by wicked pieces
And driven back, it is very dangerous
To make a raid with the queen early on in the game
It is best, in opening, to make but one move with the queen
And that, to a square where she is not exposed
To any direct or indirect attack




A man with no friends, only live for revenge
Live his life off the henge, cut, through a thousand men
Blade swing with the force of a cyclone
Cut crystal and bone, pistol and chrome
Stand in my path, you're a dead man
I cut the whole world in half for the Number One headband
Quest of a lonely soul, on a lonely road




(After the smoke is done)
Yo yeah
(Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one)
Yeah, what, what, who wanna do it, what
(After the smoke is done)
Slap fire outcha monkey ass niggas
(Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one)
Word up, big dick, motherfucking house
Whaddup, bench press these cats, yo


Yo, god show these niggas how we get deep, down and dirty
Like Keyon, got his wig pushed back, for 5 birdies
Yo they gotta hit placed on my head, what should the god do?
Max out in Spain and do business with the Jews?
Never that, don't ever look at me out of synch
The imperial, industrial king got weight
Don't give a fuck, like the poor part we watch Hart To Hart
They used to push me in shopping carts, now I'm writing darts
Like Ebenezer, the porno teaser
Saying words like sheeba, ____ rapper valet the visa
My team got rides like Six Flags, plus the Wu lab
Cameras in nine bedrooms we own DATs
Don't touch this crackling hot shit
I snap ya shoulder blade in half, laugh and pop shit
Reader's Digest passed my book to L. Ron Hubbard
It got back that the world government tried to dub it
But devils love it, booby-trap raps cover the track like ADAT
Sharper than cuts laced on Marley
Scratched supreme clientele, my cartel
Willie Stargel passed this shit his piece, where's the Nobel?
Oh well, signing off as usual
The arsonist leaving niggas lost in the stairwell


(Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one)
Yeah, yo, yo, represent my projects Stapleton
(After the smoke is done)
He represent that project Park Hill
(Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one)
You represent that project Murder West Brighton Now Born
Arm banging into that will (ahhhhh), word up
(After the smoke is clear)
Yeah, what, Stapleton
(Delphonics and Wu-Tang still here)
Park Hill, word up, yeah, yeah, New York


The greatest story ever told by me, precisely
Roman numeral IV plus three describe me
My son move like the toad, get drunk, speak in codes
Throw a fiend in the sleeper hold, got beef with the globe
Met my comrade, go half on this lab down in Baghdad
Flipping like a meth's tab, get money like an Arab
The tight niggas snapped six legs on the crab
Now hush, you wanna do what? My clique better bust


Underprivileged, grew up in a Stapleton house village
Where blood flood the water in streets like oil spillage
My front door was blowing, the debt man spotted 55 boa
Niggas was still flowing, voice was echoing
I rise high like an octave
The proctor wouldn't gamble the sample, it shocked her
My ninjas run round like Shaka Zulu, some play peace like Donny the Guru
Others live to be wise and old like Desmond Tutu
Undisputed champion belt holders, shaped and mould us
Soul controller of the lunar, solar or the polar
I blow hash smoke through my nasal, my brain with worth 30 billion
Wu-Tang  battalion was like cannibal weight in Brazilians


After the smoke is done
Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one
After the smoke is done
Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one
After the smoke is clear
Delphonics and Wu-Tang still here
After the smoke is done
Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one
Ahhhhh (Wuuuuuu, wuuuuuu)








Hey wait a minute, man, what about me?
Hey wait a minute, y'all got
Y'all play a role in a racket flow
It was an act of God
I don't know what kind of act it was
I don't know how a junkie bust into my room and stole my TV
Hey, it wasn't me, man
Why ain't you out here arrestin' him?
Instead of runnin' him out
It was me, I confess! I confess!
Dead story, a respectable workin' person can't even walk 5 minutes
On the street without somethin' happenin'
All you cops don't do nothin'!
Junkier than police, one right behind the other with his hand out
Oh, baby, he's gonna get rid of both of you cops


Ayo, we always gon' hit heads left and right
We always gon' get dumb skets to fight
We always smoke and drink to set shit right
Yo it's always gon' be left, to we left the light


We always gon' be thug niggas and see drug figures
Always gon' be stuck on the block, fuckin' with cops
Always gon' get McGirts, liftin' skirts
Turn around and let the click just work
We always gon' be chasin' cash, racin' fast
Like we don't need life yo
It's always gon' be street life
We always gon' bank the dough, spank the hoe
Drink some Mo', you better act like you think you know
It's always gon' be Queens N.Y
Always gon' be scenes when men die
We always gon' be doin' time for doin' crimes
It's always gon' be in Riker's Island
We always gon' be "life is wildin"
We always gon' be puffed out, mobbed out
With your bitch gettin' dogged out
And the click gettin' slobbed out
Love between thugs, it's love between clubs
It's always gon' be, like the giddy, it's always ownin' me
We always gon' shake the dice, stay laced in ice
Talk the Judas down when we hate the price
Always gon' keep it funky
It's always gon' be grungy
We always gon' eat cuz we always gon' be Hungry
We always gon' grab the dick, try to bag a chick
And walk around with a grill like we mad at shit
We always gon' be in project hallways
Crowdin' up the doorways, drownin' up the Jorday's
We always gon' be naughty
Liberty bassly, forty, niggas be crazy, whodi
Always




Yo it's a..


....warnin', East New York niggas formin'
Beats say Bang Ya Head, Sister Sledge
War dance with the wild Apache Indian
Get Tom machine gun, fast car, big engine
Few squads for the back massage, head job
Then it's back to business
Murder one, leave no witness
Snatch mic, bash face and fight
Red light scope at night
Movin' through the Snow dressed in White
It's the ninja from the rooftop site
Aim for the brain, snipe from the buildin' across the boulevard
Hit him from a hundred yards
I just got a type from 'Preme behind bars
Peace God, you beat niggas up, I suppose
Sixteen metal machine I still hold
Shoot snub from ear lobe
Fortified rich with Twelve Jewelz of Islam
Walk humble and calm
Newspaper under the arm conceal arms


You want it rough? That Hellfire stuff?
Poisonous mics, yo make the party jump
Delicious, the funk, make your heart pump
Told ya, soldiers get over the hump
Your arms are too short boy you don't wanna rump
With U-God the grump, van, black truck
Ha, heavy on the grams, every man back up
Niggas act up, let the style spin
This is Knockout Kings 2000 again
Let the style in for a few proud men
Clifton Project, rugged grain Shaolin
Women in the bed, wolves are fed
Same Wu Chamber that Bang Ya Head
Aim with the stainless, hang like dreads
Dirty at the game but the same celebs

Chorus


Yo, yo, yo
Is it the hate that make me sip the Hennessey straight?
Then go and leave my enemy face, simply erase
Make me hop out the Benz with the Tennessee plates
Make me run up in ya house shoutin', "Empty the safe"
Or could it be love? Make be rock the hoodie and gloves
Wonder if Snoop wasn't Crip, would he be Blood?
Or maybe it's where I'm from, Bushwick
That got me wearin' my gun everywhere that I come
Why your chick got my pubic hair on her tongue
Uh-huh, if you wanna see the light, nigga, stare at the sun
Can it be my older days that gave me my colder ways?
Blowin' strays at your rollerblades
Whatever it be, that make me take your leather and flee
Evidently, livin' legal never was me


Yo we livin' it, lovin' every minute, won't quit it
Hollow points aim with your first name printed
In it for the money, never did it for love
Made a few enemies, couldn't limit the slugs
Never talk much, got ways of handlin' such
The enforcer, cause the police to rush
On the daily, rarely seen, often heard
You can spot me in the Hill layin' off of the curb
On the verge of snatchin' up ya crown and throne
While I walk through the heart of the Hell and call it home
Shao' borough Commando, style thorough
Wild like a convict lose on the furlo {*echoes*}


Oh baby he's gonna get rid of both y'all cops




Continous
Yeah, youknowhatI'msayin?
Wu-Tang
Aiyyo aiyyo, come on yo yo yo I'mma shoot over here
On that AIDS thing
YouknowhatI'msayin? I'm gonna just slide in the studio quick and get this done
Yo, yo


When you're sexually frustrated, plus waiting for a long time
You both had strong minds
Combined with feelings, she seems appealing, for each other
Discreet lover, no longer keeps rubbers
Smothered under deep covers
Erotic programs, Moet and slow jams
Enough to make you hold hands and plus you a bold man
You fall in a manhole, where the forbidden tree grow
And bullshit ego, of fly negro
Her garden sour, polluted with a dead flower
Months later, he's layin on a respirator
Depending on a generator, to keep his heart moving
And start losing sight in his right eye
In weeks he might die


I know this dope-fiend cat, word up, his name is Javier
Part-time shooter sharing needles in the stairs
Wise guys disguised as a fly guy, you getting high right?
Weeded up with red shit in your right eye
You's a menace, your brain cells finished
Begging forgiveness, calling that up top shit syphillis
You know what you was gettin into
Try to guess on what I've been through
Fuck shorty raw then she scared you


AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from the Wu, it's real
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from my crew, it's real


My nigga Chuck, he loved to fuck
Everything exotic bitches down to ugly ducks
Like Nancy, who liked the fancy tickles so he put popsicles
On her nipples to make her sex passion triple quadriple
Until she bust
Overcome with passion, big ass want lust upon him
But nigga he forsake to grab the condom
Fuck it, he said AIDS, was government made
To keep niggas afraid so they won't get laid no babies be made
And the black population will decrease within a decade
German warfare product against the dark shade


AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from my crew, it's real
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from the Wu, it's real


Caught by the gravitation earth rotation
Six in the sex is deep, when you can't see clear
Through the sheer brassiere, toke back
Smoking a spliff, sippin cognac, God
You know my two love songs, Bobby Womack tracks
Got her fat ass layin flat on her back


Yo, as she lay, she wore a silk gray neglige
Alize pours, the radio play, Marvin Gaye
What's Going On? As she screams Sexual Healing
Couldn't fight the feeling her legs hit the ceiling
Hitting all positions dipped in for quick love
She's professional, she does this shit in strip clubs
Flied in June until she Acquired Immune Deficiency
Now misery is the syndrome


Oh shit, God that's wild
Damn, that's some cherry flavor shit going on though kid
For real, knowhatI'msayin?
What about the exotic type
Caskets is waitin for brothers
Word up slide on the joints baby
Before you go to sex take protection
Word up

AIDS kills, word up respect this
America Is Dying Slowly (4x)

Yeah, word yo, sliding up in this store right here
I ain't even playing that man, for real
Dig it
Respect how I'm living kid
Here forever, word up
Lubricated joints, ribbed joints is bangin
But they still playing the hotel door man
Word, you know how that be though, you know how that be
Yo, just gettin to be too old
Chick over there lookin like Sonny and Cher
Over there
Yeah
America Is Dying Slowly
Surely
America Is Dying Slowly
America Is Dying Slowly
Remember that! Syndrome, be the resident
America Is Dying Slowly
Wu-Tang, Syndrome, be the resident

Noodles, Bobby Steels, Lou Diamonds, Killer Priest
Rolly Rollie Fingers, Johnathan Blaze, Maximillion
Prodigal Sons, Anthony Starks, Hellrazor
Prodigal Son, and in the place, Sixty Second
Sunz of Man, Gambinos, forever...
Keep it safe!
Ol Dirt Schultz, word up baby
Protect yourself!
Keep it safe




Yeah, now we're gonna give a shout out, knowumsayin'?
Def Jam, knowumsayin'?
Niggas like Method Man, Redman
Say all the artists here, knowumsayin'?
Bacon Lot, knowumsayin'?
I don't need no introductions, Cat
Whuuuuut

I'm sittin' in my west, I'm analyzin' thoughts
I'm sippin' off a quart that I just had bought
I'm thinkin' of the moment, things soar in that head
I feel assurin' durin', also glad
Yes, feel assured by knowin' I won
Cuz there's no one who can fuck wit A-Sun
I'm not bein' pushy but I'm born to boss
You need A-Sun, oh yes, well of course
Don't see the riot, everyone keeps quiet
If you don't believe nigga, get hyper and try it
Yes it is me, a total fresh MC
Yo, I'm born to be, MC history
Rhyming on time because that's the deal
You're only as fresh as your ass feel
Other MC's, you are bound to fall
Cuz your real world is not a world at all

1 - 
Drunken Master, styles causin' street disaster
Blaze cut faster than a fairy slasher
Tai-chi, Kung Fu fighting, ODB hands quick as lightenin'
Techique too deadly
Iron fist blew the pawn, switch styles like lay long
Let's get it on, heavy chow broke, it's not 'bout
Shadow boxin', better punch, you need oxegen, try again
When you catch the second wind, I'll break you in


Approach the mic slow, it's about to blow
One foot crow crane, anti-chain movement
Restore the ming, some take this thing for joke
Serious men deep in thought, misunderstood, held the fork
He's too defensive, too mean, you didn't, now it's a scene
These cats over here got Glock holdin' him down
These niggas scheming, I'm seeing everything
Ten steps ahead, on the wall smokin' my
Agent high told best friend of the wine


Still drunk offa cheap wine
Holdin' front lines, niggas wanna front, fine
Fuck wit me and mine, rain on your sunshine
Swine nigga's come as hard as a pork rind
Can you dig it? Only five percent live it
While the rest of you fake niggas try to get it
Now fuck around

Repeat 1


Down wit the All In Together Now Crew
The GZA, the RZA, me of course too
The thing I'm analyzing is strickly Hip Hop
That's what's made, well made is on my workshop
You was unable plus earn advance
Just to touch the untouchable kip hop dance
They're sayin' of the utmost, truly I'm the utmost
Have you ever caught the hip hop holy ghost
Man, I mean really, that shit is mad hype
Especially when you find yourself rhymin' over mics
I became a wrecker through my amplifier
Break it down base, treble through my dancer
That's one new dance, it's to my Black Magic music
It's not classic, arabic, or basic
It's strickly thickly, dirty and districkly
If not don't you pick me and forget me

Repeat 1




A game of chess is like a swordfight;
You must think first before you move
Toad style is immensely strong and immune to nearly any weapon;
When it's properly used it's almost invincible




Raw I'm a give it to you, with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
Like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MCs approach with slang that's dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushing force, my force you're doubting
I'm making devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains


Well I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary, and carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum, and the isle I'm from
Is coming through with enough niggas, and enough guns
So if you want to come sweating, stressing contesting
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk, if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk
I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain there's no way to barricade me
Steamrolling niggas like a eighteen wheeler
With a drunk driver driving, there's no surviving


Rough like Timberland wear, yeah
Me and the Clan in 'Yota Landcruisers out there
Peace to all the crooks, all the niggas with bad looks
Bald heads, braids, blow this hook
We pack chrome Tecs, nickel plated Macs
Black ACs, drug dealing styles in phat stacks
I only been a good nigga for a minute though
Cuz I got to get my props, and win it yo
I got beef wit commercial-ass niggas with gold teeth
Lamping in a Lexus eating beef
Straight up and down don't even bother
I got forty niggas up in here now, who kill niggas' fathers


Here comes the argument
Here comes the argument
Here comes the argument
Folderol
It's all about strikes now
So here's what's striking me


Hey you get off my cloud
See me get raw with my southpaw style
Mover, puffing on a fat blunt from Cuba
It's the Meth-Tical jet to Cal, I'm the Buddha
Monk on the hunt for machine gun funk
I gets you open like a slug from the shotgun pump
Double-barrel, yeah Meth bring it to them proper
Partner, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
Straight up, you moving too fast so baby wait up
Took one, added seven more now you eight up
Get on down with your bad self
Get on down, listen to the sound, come on
Few can ever get this ultimate legit
See you all up in my ass
But you don't know shit, uh-huh
What's your definition of a real emcee
From what you dedicated, hey it must be me
Meth-Tical, a rude descendant of the loud hip-hop
I go on to the break of dawn, and just don't stop
Give me the green light, and the sign one way
Have you had your meth today? Huh!
Move it in, move it out
Stick it in, pull it out
Shake it up, shake it down
Come on down, Meth-Tical
Move it in, move it out
Stick it in, pull it out
Shake it up, shake it down
Come on down, Meth-Tical


Here comes the argument
Here comes the argument
Here comes the argument

Dirty Bas, style cuts like glass
Gotta gotta keep it high power to the mass
Yo Taj, another-like platinum hit
Party people all around be sayin that's the shit


Kaboom, guess who stepped in the room
Tical, hailing from the Shaolin Isle
It be me the killer bee, on the M-I-C
With the S-S-double-double-U to the V-V
Me me going downtown, let me see
If we all and together now, make it mo' better now
Listen I ain't sweating no competition
Flow, going mad low like I'm dissing


Another chapter from the Wu-Tang group
Take a look or a peak, killer bees never sleep
Nonstop put you on the chopping block
Unorthodox, attitude to melting pot


I'll do anything, I'm so into you
Right here, I'm Weak, downtown with the Wu
Kaboom, guess who stepped in the room
The S-S-double-double-U to the V-V


Anything you want me to do I'll do it
Oh, anything that you want me to do, to do
Anything you want me to do I'll do it

As high as Wu-Tang get
Allah allow us pop this shit
Just like black shoe fit
If you can't wear it, well don't fuck with it!


Yo, too many songs, weak rhymes that's mad long
Make it brief Son, half short and twice strong
No doubt, it took time searchin, eventually
It was prime urgent, for you to examine the rhyme merchant
Lace MC's with styles when they rhyme drunk
On a label hunt, until twenty thou, out the trunk
Eight Diagram sword swinga armored tank force
RZA throw in the disc but then change the bank source
You can't flow, must be the speech impediment
You got lost off the snare off Impeach the President
Whether in Amsterdam smokin seven grams of green
Then you pack, a thousand white teens in tight jeans
This Witty Unpredictable shot is critical
To analytical analogy, insurance policies why
Said he know that sounds define the note
Couldn't recognize, blast him the fuck behind the ropes
Too many dope niggas I see starvin
Catch a single deal, a possible plea bargain
Wu slay regardles to whom or what, five mics five nights
Hang him from the balcony, drop twenty-five flights
A fugitive bass playin rap czar
Smoke the cigars, his prints on the strings of his guitar


As high as Wu-Tang get
Allah allow us pop this shit
Just like black shoe fit
If you can't wear it, well don't fuck with it!


Tical got a hold on ya, doin exactly
What the fuck I mariju-wanta, dis nigga nasty
Deep in the dirty dungeon, buggin, lovin
The ways these rhymes keep comin, at cha splash ya
Get your head piece fractured, with killer cuts
From the Shropshire Slasher, rip shit up
Got this whole thing Tang mastered, sho nuff
An MC too good to be touched, John John
Bring the phenomenon, I cold crush
MC, inferiorities they froze up, ice cold
As we move on, saga unfold
Captivated by a saga that go untold, like Goldfinger
Caught up in a cliffhanger
Yo I-N-S another code red, danger, break out the vest
Now it's tactical warfare, it's all here
Come with your shield and hardware, it be on here
Don't ever roam, in the naked city
Eight million stories none pretty
Bomb em wit the Witty Unpredictable
Conditionin' be critical
Peace to Tang, gettin high on your physical, dis next drink
Is a toast to your memory
When I go how many niggas gon' remember me


As high as Wu-Tang get
Allah allow us pop this shit
Just like black shoe fit
If you can't wear it, well don't fuck with it!




There's no coke
What?
You heard me you dumb fuck, there's no coke
What the fuck do you mean there's no coke?
I've been up and down this ship
I've been in every fucking room
There's gotta be coke
There is nothing, nothing

*heavy panting*
Help PLEASE!
*panting continues*
Help me!
*gunshot*


It's assassination day, I stalk


I move through the Third World, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I live's a 25 to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
Cream is short, Cee Cipher Power stalk, plus the fiend talk
3 Gs the cost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen goal but it fail
Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter
Devil's poisoning the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened
Trapped in deep water, gasping
I clash with the titans for my half on the action


I stop producers careers, the weak spot was the ears
Scorpion darts hits the mark, pierce the heart with silver spears
You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still feel this so you're living build tilted
MCs upon their axis, their body hazard tactic
Lactic acid, desert dry cactus, practice
You can never match this invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice
The mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches
Unforgivable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects more livable
Interchangeable, caution: flammable
My chamber is 99 plus 1  unnameable angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
We creep through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare


First of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don
Spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurging, merging in the suburbs
Using this just like an adverb, action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aiming like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pa
You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Holding like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high, yo Bobby
You hear how I'm shooting it like they blue tops
No, you won't play me like your lady
Pay me 380, spit it at you like a baby, final destination Haiti


War's extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take things to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MCs to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue death than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in
Murderous rhyming, constantly inclining
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain then absorbs the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback






The RZA, the GZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Inspectah Deck
Raekwon the Chef, U-God, Ghostface Killah, Masta Killa
And the Me --- yeah, yeah, come on, now, now


What's happening? Who get it cracking like a neck snapping
For the rapping, and who them fellas packing yelling Staten
From the background, I'll back down a few
Try to clown us in the past, where they at now?
I'm ill as baby powder with the smackdown, for the record
My brain is like the project projected, for the Method
Go see my nigga Kush, he got the best shit for burning
This one go out for whom it may concerning
Spending they entire earning, trynna get a higher learning
MC's is vermin, like E be Sermon
Ya'll too determined, feeling yaself like Pee-Wee Herman
While we at it, let's tighten up our grips around that cabbage
Silly rabbits, how many kids'll trick you out your carrots
Ghetto bastards and ghetto bitches, I break you like a bad habit
My dick is two inches too big for it's britches
Uh, so fuck a mister and your misses
Cottonmouth niggas X'ed out like Merry Christmas, that all
Uh-huh, be home

*bell rings*


Knock, knock, who is it, Tical I pop digit
My block too hot to visit, round here, you gots to live it
MC's, you must admit it, I'm deadly on this mic like
Anthrax on this premise, anyone of ya'll can get in
I breathe, Backwoods sleeves and THC
I bleed, kamikazes and forty OZ's
America's Most, the better the smoke, the better the quotes
For cheddar, Meth'll sever the throat, whatever the coast
I'm home, let the sun shine on, get his grind on
And get some phone time, everytime I'm in your timezone
Look here, it's crooked letter I, ya'll don't meet nothing but crooks here
It's hot in hell's kitchen, get your cookware, for goodness
MC's is like that shit chicks be gushing
For pushing, got me tooken down to Central Booking
I stick out, as if Tical just walked up in the party with my dick out
And I'm prepared to take the shit I dish out

"When you realize that what you got ain't what you want" - sample


On the, yo, on the expressway, suddenly, I, um, hit the breaks
A mistake, patrol figure just, ran the plates
I pull to the shoulder, a half mile ahead
The vibe got colder when the marksman said
"Yo, you in the truck, get the fuck out your car
Put your hands where my eyes could see, not far"
A fat slob, with pepperspray in the canister
Donut shop lounger, nine mil brandisher
Plus my half pound just rang the bell
Of the bloodhound, had an acute sense of smell
I guess he was tired of the strip and booking whores
Moving off a tip he's claimed he's looking for
Some MC's wanted for a string of break-ins
Last seen wearing long minks and snakeskins




Light is shinin.. beauty sunshine
Here comes one-time.. the ball was so fine
Heat is blazin.. the kids were playin
His partner was shady.. tryin to save the babies


A-yo, they didn't know the cop was crooked
He had blow out in Brooklyn
All this while he let the fiends cook it
The baseheads stirred it up, plus they got to blow it up
Dropped it off in the PJ's and they bigged it up
Then one day, shit jumped off real crazy
The middle of a bathroom they find an old lady
No clothes, half of her tongue, ear missin
The killer had to be mad smart, he wore mittens
Even though her leg was bitten
Crackheads point the finger at Detective Slick Morris Gittins
Paleface cop who done popped the best
And got the chop on his neck from when he knocked Celeste
It was a slug, drug, he pressured everybody on the block
Some niggas know him as the Godson of Gotti
And his black partner, he was scared to speak
He saw how they planted weapons on these kids in the street
He saw like over fifty bodies in like fifty-two weeks
He saw his colleague pick up money before leavin his beat
They call him desk duty, Robocop
Younger dudes call him Freddy Krugs from the way he walk on the block




Heard the disturbance out the window, oh shit they got my son
Pulled over his Tempo, Brenda dropped the endo
Had her little nephew with her yo she didn't care
They always harassed her, until she blew the captain with a razor
His partner turned red in his waist, maced her, smacked her
With the walkie, yoked her then slammed her on her face
He bugged on her like she was drugged, plugged one in her
The fifth relaxed her like a big thug pistol whipped her
Heard she was dusted, must've been the way they threw the cuffs on her
She broke the shits, went and rushed the kid
Wavin her hands, she had a half an axe, all in her tracks
He grabbed her by the hair, she broke his jaw it cracked
More cops arrived, they both bloodied down by the five
Wildest niggas just smilin cause it look live
They gave her forty years in New Orleans, callin me wodie
Shorty was young, by three days had a great bid




You're just worms in the worst part of the apple that's rotten
You squirm and you turn from the right, still plottin
All slimy cause you stay grimy, petty crimey cat
You sometime me, don't need to remind me about
Livin in the core, with the scramblers in front of the store
The bum holdin the door, the mugging no one saw
We played ball in the alley where dope was shot raw
And the school they kept flawed, plus the lowest test scores
Small percentage determined to strengthen they position
Transformation from critical to, stable condition
But it still be obstacles on niggas that's optical
Watchin you like salt-water sharks that's tropical
The money was the root and it's the instinct to make it
With they pockets and fridge naked, many aim to take it
Whether - hold up, set up, stabbin or a wet up
Just to know it was the kid next door fizzucked your head up
Once he fell short, frequently visit the courts
And for some, another way out, is music and sports
That's why I, keep the rhyme just as fly as a shot
That won the championship, with just oh on the clock

 - repeat 2X



"It's true - the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang, could be dangerous!"


Uh-huh, Mr. Biggs, Trackmasters (woo!)
It's a Wu-Tang official right here y'know


Yeah, the employees of the year yeah we're back to work
We took time off, while other rappers got jerked
Shit's bout to change now, it's a shame how
Things ain't the same but I'm back in the game now
And as we step in the door, we cause panic
Yep, the usual suspects, we at it
Vet status, y'all went a week with the belt
Few chicks felt your style, now you feelin yourself
Meet your maker, I dropped you at eight years old
I got stock in your flow and crops to sharehold
Crops with the prose where cops won't dare go
Got top centerfolds too hot to wear clothes
Still me - always have and will be
Ill G - it's silly to hate but feel free
Hey - hear what I say, they gotta pay
And my return is like Christ, declare the holiday


Back in the game now.. copped me some weed now
My people bout to eat now.. shit's bout to change now
Back in the game now.. all my niggas in the hood now
Better catch up now.. shit's bout to change now


Uh, y'all see I'm in the street strugglin
Young dumb and thuggin, give a FUCK about nuttin
Stuck at rock bottom, tryin to come up on somethin
Pumpin from sundown to sun-up, we hustlin
Vision my nigga now get in where you fit in
And see prison, as just the high cost of livin the life
Ante up cause if you blow the dice
On that O-Z, Dorothy ain't goin home tonight
That's on e'rythang, put it on the kids and the wife
Been buryin my folks ever since they raised the price on the coke
Searchin for a quick antidote
Mo' money, mo' problems to cope


We were at the same table when the chips were checked
A gamblin +Rebel+ who +Inspects+ the +Deck+
Just when you thought we would fold our hand
Against all odds we raised the bet like we changed the plans
It was live on air but in between station breaks
I was holdin a pair and just made the table stakes
Split the demos, put insurance on tapes
A safeguard against the crusaders in capes
If I double down they say the Gods are sharks
If we win against the house they thought the cards was marked
We draw hit after hit from a royal flush menu
While the dealer promoted the full house venue
A spade in the club with the heart to wear diamonds
The high roller who got credit upon signin
They look puzzled when I shuffle, most of 'em stunned by the hustle
Recourse of bluff game's your muscle

 - 0.75X
 Say what? ("Shaolin shadowboxing!")
 Shit's bout to change..


Aiyyo, on rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich, coolin with a mean ill Jamaican bitch
Banana coat matchin with the ratchet
Lil' black weave sweatpants style, air force is actin
Jump in the 6, kicks look crisp, talkin bout the bird
Flow through your hood in the mean tints that's giant
It's like the family that flipped on you for lyin
Buried you alive, left your whore cryin
We on your floor look more doors
Dey ain't ate either, I hope y'all niggas is armed
And when we get there, all my niggas in the mix
Yeah Shallah Lex, Diamond got me buyin Louis Rich wear


Most people say the Clan was missin since I got dropped offa radio
Overnight your whole style was bitten in the process
Everybody switched they names like
Whatcha call it, any fast (?)
It was the Gods that repped that, sharkskin dark skinned bitches
Clarks from Digi left the game dizzy
Ooh got busy, that dancey shit slid through
We had to stay hood cause that's who we been through
RZA came through, mastermind got the cash and power
Proof that power plastered divine classical lines
Mathematical rhymes, the style is unbearable
Now niggas with the radical shines
It's Ghost-Deini, every coast need me
We back motherfucker that's right, it's the W.T.C
World Trade Center, Wu-Tang Clan
We brought so much heat that we was givin you tans an' shit



{*Ron Isley ad libs to fade*}

But thats the last thing on my mind

Give me the cue


Skip the introduction proceed to lip function
The junction get rushed by some grimy people busting weed
Splatter your melon like some Attica felons
Use a firearm good, Bloods go for heart swelling
Insert the spasm, yes the dirty herb has him
Thoroughbred thugs insert the fantasm
Verbal smarts, spark the word, visit my scripture
Exotic wine, holding nine Picasso pictures
When the rhyme pivot you now, limit your chance
Bodyguard the lyric with unlimited stance
Words seem to zing on down to Beijing
When we touch down, would you crown renowned kings


There's no honor amongst thieves
Street pharmaceutical stack like Genovese
The Four Devils tempt madmen but not these
We profound hardcore sound to MCs, thumbs down, prepare
Killa bees it be warfare, this the year
Niggas gotta take you off of here, hold the square
If we go there we go gritty and spread fear
Through this rap city, call the mayor
My razor sharp darts be like cold stares
The smell of fear make my nostrils flair, truth or dare?
Ask yourself can you compare to these niggas in the hood
Johnny B. Goode or he be gone yeah
The struggle goes on, you've been warned
PLO from here to Lebanon, how many bomb
Must we drop in the Ninety-Now?
Walk a mile in my shoes, get the street news from Meth-Tical


Glocks'll be spitting, you gots to be kidding
Aiyo kid you gots to be kidding
Or Glocks'll be spitting
You gots to be kidding yo


It's common sense how I master my circumference, you dense
I get locked the fuck up, released on my own recognizance
Can't be judged, young bloods bust back like scuds
Wu-Tang hovers one thousand notches above
MC level, yo, I stay highs like treble
Foes who oppose get plucked like rose petals
Arresting and holding, penetrate forbidden regions
Wack MCs only lasting one season
The morale was low at the corral
Adjective pronouns had no style, your weak proposal
Aim for the official, initial is Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah
All that other bullshit ain't permissible
Annual increase of the Wu-Tang Manual
Handles to keep all this Hip Hop shit tangible
Illegible, every egg ain't edible
My tracks remain 'Unforgettable' like Ol' Nat Cole
Got to catch this paper to buy Shaquasia a glacier
Nebuchadnezzar skyscraper
Understanding the continents of Africa and Asia
And free the Black Man from enslaved labor, Wu-Tang


The weight of the fam is on our back and we can't fall
Victim to this long hall of fame, meaning nothing
We came to punish the glutton with a substance
That can't be contained, Wu-Tang


Motherfuckers
We be seeing y'all asses when we walk up in the club
Y'all all in the back
Scared to speak, we speak cause you scared
Punk motherfucker, we know what time it is


All you been seeing is upsets in the boxing shit, right
It's like come on man
This nigga fucked up motherfucking Whitaker
Dang, he caught Whitaker
He caught Whitaker a long time ago
Mike got touched
Then Mike got touched by Holyfield
Hey Mike's, Mike's gonna forfeit this fight
He ain't fighting McDermit
He ain't fighting
Nope
Whattup
You talking bout he, what he, what he, what he did
Told them he cut his eye, in sparring


Stella D'oro wrap breadsticks, David Berkowitz
Einstein birthed a hit, now nurture it
M.G.M. front row seat tonight, no gems
Purify, cleanse, ran into some beef up in the men's
Fix your sawed off, Wu-Tang tore me off the cross
All you saw was white meat, skin hanging off
These is words from the Arch Bishop, some call it six up
The Betty Crocker Marvel cake, snakes will miss a
Wax janitor, black Jack Mulligan from Canada
Slam dance, tarantula style, you's a fan of the
Monopoly king, Slavic poetry
Carnegie Hall's off the hook, let's push through the armory
Mack truck hitting soloist, Soul Controllers
Behold of the thousand teeth fist, swift and boneless


You know cause Wu-Tang is invincible, you know what I mean
It's Wu-Tang Forever God
We gonna get down with that W
You gonna get down with that W
That's that Wu, that's that Wisdom
That's the Wisdom of the Universe
That's the truth, of Allah, for the Nation of the Gods
YouknowhatI'msayin
We breaking egg through these days God
YouknowhatI'msayin
We got the fucking way
We got the medicine for your sickness
Out here, ya knowhatImean
I was telling Shorty like
Yo Shorty, you don't even gotta go to summer school
Pick up the Wu-Tang double CD
And you'll get all the education you need this year
YouknowhatImean
Their poisoned minds can't comprehend this shit
Word man it's Wu-Tang Forever God
Niggas can't fuck with these lyrics God
YouknowhatI'msayin
Knamean
Oh hell no, none of this shit
C'mon man -- beats, lyrics man, y'all niggas
Niggas can't even understand half this shit
I think niggas ain't gonna figure it out til the year Two-G
(Wax niggas ass for free or fee) Word
Yo, you know what
The next Wu-Tang album ain't even coming out until 2000
YaknowhatImean
That's just gonna come back with a comet
You hear, we gonna bring a comet
Check for that shit in the millenium
YouknowhatImean? So, yo, y'all niggas man
Be the resurrection
The Gods is here man
Born Gods is here






Burn something kid


Yeah, youknowwhatImsaying, let me tell you something man
Through the man's mind, God
He see his elevation, God
See through his mind, he see his elevation, God
See this where he begin to know that where he come from
See some people don't have no direction, God
Because they don't know the science of they self
See the signs of life is the signs of you
All the elements that it took to create you
Everything that's in the universe, God
That's created the universe, God, is just within you
You see what I'm sayin?
And that's the mind that you can't see
Don't you know if a man could take and flip himself inside out, God
He'll fall out and die if he sees the shit that goes on...inside?


So you mean to tell me I'm the creator of all this right here?


You the creator of all this
Because all these things must happen, it must take place
See people go back in the day, God
They say: one man, one woman, Adam and Eve, there ain't no such thing
Everything you see always has been and always will what be
Regardless the womb or what, it's got to be


Hit me, hit me, hit me, I don't wanna hear nothin
Word Up
Got to pay
Yeah, it's like that right?
Blow his back out, make his shoes worth


A-yo, this shit be off the noggin rock it
Whatever cock block it
Cat get blown, who own this street corner
Foreigner hesitate to rock a Hummer
Navy Seal top runner, rhyme this summer
For real, marinating nigga's skating
Debating waiting style flowingly relating
Fine line switch it on ya, like venetian blinds
The mission is mine, fabulous king I divine
Titanium Hydro collide though
Yo dun dun polly this conjunction, son one
Slang doctor, medicated kids pay it
Say it, these niggas in affect dun, stay rap related
Cassette rhymer, 5-G consigner, line for liner
Poet designer, sharp like Linus
Mic of the year award, fly gear award
Them niggas over there be analyzing with one sword
Get bent, pay the rent, plus still we invent
Nuff shit to get your whole team crazily sent
Now all I need is a half gallon of weed
Proceed, to bust this mic dick and make three seeds
Then max out like two Ac's inside the parking lot
Son bark a lot and get his team hit in the dark a lot
What now blow, clicking like a calico
Gold, Maximillion, one love keep it real yo


Yo, hit me for these Tommy Hill, ice-rocking niggas
Peace, this summer's mines, I blow the biggest
Back up off me, while I grab my dick and hold the Heini
Park the Blue 600, Wally kings is right behind me
Tackle clubs, never rock Lugz, I'm way above
These mics is like the Golden Gloves verses spark plug
Its like the pennant, seminar's the play-off
Start the J off like Cochran got OJ off
This specialist who eyeballed your mistress necklace
Perpetuous, this curly-head kid's treacherous
Let go the eggo, so we can dip dip dive like Lego
Throw on can-can, eat that plus this instrumental
Ah shit say Stark-ologist
Starks-ologist, fried fish halibut
Pull out the bull horn, let's celebrate like Kunta was born
We elbowed our way inside Loud and got on
I played the building, burn a branch and get filled in
Like Pilgrims G-in' Pepridge farms from out of millions
Who wanna rhyme, who wanna challenge the swordmans
That rock that fisherman hat like Gorton's


I hold down the place, no shots to the face
Elite Special force no religious style faith
The melting pot boil gun shot drama soil
Gamble when I scramble handle hot pots of oil
Manhandle pain killing erect my hidden
Streets made me potent put your 9-6 bid in
Vampire curse disperse on each verse
Swim in black water, act slaughter through my earth
You're hit by my element Great Wall of China
Mountain peak holds the globe like vagina
Measure on my mic stand, molecule and strand
Finger rolling rhythm ride the horse one hand
Golden Eye, Spy vs. Spy, guilty of suspicion
Chess boxer, mic in dead body position
40 oz. Ciga-art, three verse invention
Divine universal black man representing
Similar to pure, rhyme blowing out the pore
Battery in the back, keep me charged for the raw
I'm bred type thorough, pistolero gun hero
Renaissance rebel chatter-boxing your barrel
Fully woven Beethoven, hit you on a humble
Hard enough to hurt you, chastise my rap styles
Lock down, for this curfew




BLACK MAMBA!


Uh huh huh.. Black Mamba!
Uh huh huh.. Black Mamba!
Uh huh huh.. Black Mamba!
Uh huh huh.. Black Mamba!


Yo unbreakable steel sword swingin', face the Black Mamba
Deadly Vipers, squeeze ya life out like anacondas
In the story, off wit ya head, the scene is gory
Single-edged steel blade designed by Hattori
Hanzo. You see the signature above the handle?
Try to strike out, you get ya arm dismantled
Chief of the Yakuza's wicked like Medusa
With Crazy 88's too, 'bout to meet ya maker


Ol' Dirty Bastard swordplay
Dirt McGirt be pickin' up skirts on 4th and Broadway
Japanese bitch be suckin' my dick
Puerto Rican hoes be lickin' my split
California Mountain Snake on the bed
Be givin' my head while I'm countin' my cake, crushin' up an 8th
Of that snow white shit, in the Pussy Wagon not hittin' the brakes!




Baaaaaamm.. hidden swordstyle hits, I wish
A nigga would test the Black Mamba, in a spit like the coma
Fill his Copperhead with the hollow tip lead
Yo.. who wanna dance with the fertile lands' deadly state?
Cottonmouth sticky from the Af' gooey
Blowin' smoke through the Viper Pit
Hold a listener tight, mic constrictor
Words from the theater, swift as Krishner






*sounds of fighting*
Stupid fool, you're forcing me to kill you!


Yeah, you know how it go
Fresh from the stationary hall of justice
Real rhyming, real movement, real life
Word up, we just chilling, ten bottles of Krug on the wall
Youknowhatimsaying? Straight up, for real
Yo, RZA, talk to these niggas, man, let's go, man, for real
Yo, Rah, what up? Let's go, yeah, gangsta shit, groovy shit
Raw shit, secret indictment shit, yeah
Secret indictments, be careful, niggas
For real, let's go


You better get that money, no matter, what you do
You gotta get that money, and represent your crew
And keep it true


As reaper stay sprayed, still niggas is smoked
Four in his pocket, a diamoned up chain and some coke
Champion hood, the goodies in a brown bag, by the radiator
Near the cookies and the bundles of dope
Fishscalers, I live in elevators and gross
All this paper, profit make her lay there and post
With them Adidas that Bruce wore, stay in the juice bar
All I know if you saw me, you thought I was broke
Black, yo, I been hustling since niggas was busting guns
And scuffling, and jumping niggas over some coats
We play the S&S rooftop, Latin Quarter, Polo popes
Who hung out with all the Eighthers and GOAT's




Yo RZA, you crazy man
This that Black Mozart shit, right here


Yo, I used to scramble hard, radio strapped, to the handlebars
Fifty deep, in the lobby large, rocking camouflage
Dark Caesar holding my nuts, played the building front
Fifth of Henny, throw a little snow in the blunt
Just growing up, schooled by O.G.'s, holding O's and up
Daily new drama unfold, they popped 'em over, what?
It's so rough, nobody know him, so what?
Aiyo, the money's close by, homey, show me the stuff
Borough hopping, copping bricks, bags, burners and kicks
City slickers, circling the strip, working them tricks
Like friday night cruise in the Coupe, new valor suit
Fruit flavored kicks, taking flicks out in 40 Deuce
Farmer jeans, hammer swing, tucked in the loot
How they hit Miss Fisher, they was busting at suit
Up in 54, underground, parrot and Q
Made man with the grey shams, wrapping the boo
Stay flam, every day, fam, stacking my loot
Eighty grams in the cake, bam, packages flew
Sipping passion fruit, Alize, in back of the Ooh


We soldiers, boy, we soldiers
Bake cakes, hundred dollar bill holders
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers
Bighead, I thought I told ya
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers
Bake cakes, hundred dollar bill holders
Bighead, I thought I told ya
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers






Hard days of work
You had a hard day at work baby
I want you to sit down, relax
While I soak you in my mentals
Backrub style, watch this, yo, yo
Massage, peppermint oil, shampoo and pears
Cinnamin, aloe, natural for you hair
Soak lavender soap, coconut conditioning
Honey lather, blood flowing, love listening
Motion lotion, breeze, over the ocean
Lovers, bath crystals, lovers sponge scrubbers
Hot milk bath, steam shower rubbin
Diesel splash, long lovin in your oven
Bake it off, break it off 'til it gets soft
Passion fruit, pussy cat, want to touch it off
In and out, fragrance patience, Hershey's Kisses, Guinness Stout
Stress reliever soak your feet, air them out
Brain message, think about pink
Stress relieving, no dishes in the sink
Upper lower, left, right, neck don't play
Back rub, Calgon, take me away
Waterfall beads, streams, plush and lavish
Comfort me through all the damn madness
Night breeze at sea, sipping tea
You and your queen melodies, and trees, 85 degrees
Jet skis breeze...
Sprinkle water on chocolate, butter scotch flowers
Vapor action, tropical sunshower
Baby powder, relax, feel for an hour
Sand suntan, snuggled up snug
Snowey days, fireplace, oriental rug
Thugs, lay on the couch, pull it out, perfect balance
Chemical stimuli, two tokes off the chalace
Complete silence, what surround us
Whats the finest, wrapped in cold sheets
Vanilla apple heat, flutes play jazz music, puffy pillow suites
Breakfast in bed, early morning sun treats
Sunset level, suprise sunrise, sail
Lay on the couch, while I clip your toenails
Dreams of peaches and cream steam secret spells
Soft spoken gospel, Barry White acapell
Violin, good medicine, sound swell
Sunshine life, love right without the hell
Taste sugar, quiet storm, seasick
Slowdance drink, like nights over Egypt
Having, stabbing, calm chilling now we rolling
Company, ice cream licking now we holding
Gentle force, warm tingle of the golden
Open loose, ice cubes, kiss your belly
Alcohol, palm trees, peanut butter jelly
Almond twirl, fantastic melodies
Soon, taste these spoons
Wiping me with toon, fly wine, quiet storm
Now it's high noon, raspberry spices
Cherry breath, drink from the mountain, sip the very best
Sounds of the shore, every winter is a war
Paradise life, recipe now pour
Musicness, model, gentle mental
Wash away your sorrow, Fantasy Island
Put the message in the bottle
Carry you through, the threshold, do my duty
Happy ending, go to rest Sleeping Beauty


Yo, this is that body shop shit
Love love slam
Edible underwear, champagne, bubble bath
Have your snack on that ass that
Know what I mean?
Massaging these melodies
Put that gangsta shit on the shelf
Blow winds, blow, through your hair
Sea breeze sticks and shit
Right right


When your around boo
Come and chop this mother fucking beat you stank-ass trick




That's right, that's right, that's right
Yeah check this shit out
KnowI'msayin'
This is dedicated to all my hoes
KnowI'msayin'
All my babies mothers knowI'msayin'
All my bitches knowI'msayin'  let me tell a motherfucker something
Ya'll motherfuckers want this money, bitch
You better earn this motherfucking money


Bitch let me show you something
My name's Dirt Dog, bitch ain't no frontin'
Bitch let me show you something
My name's Dirt Dog, bitch ain't no frontin
Bitch let me show you something
My name's Dirt Dog, bitch ain't no frontin

AAAAAAHHHH!!


Walking down the street dark, dark, night
Saw a pretty girl, bitch caught my sight
Bitch, so fine fine as can be
Bitch, you know you belong to me
Drove over said how you be
Bitch you know my name's Dirt Dog, dope MC!
Dirt Dog I know what you about
Bitch get the fuck in the car!!
Drove her to my house
Aaaaahhh to my house
Open the door take off your clothes
Throw'em on the floor took off my clothes
Showed em my dick
Bitch dis something that you'll never forget
On the 1st pump started to scream
On the 2nd pump she thought she had a bad dream
On the 3rd pump she started to cry
Dirt Dog I don't wanna die
Well shut the fuck up!!
Pussy ain't nuttin but a skinny ol' bone
You can fuck it you can suck you can leave it alone
25 cents is the regular price
50 cents you can fuck it twice
75 cents you can fuck it to the bone
And a dollar' worth leave it alone




Ayo it's war on the street, blood on the cobblestone
I leave 'em buried alive, just like a fossil bone
Body bags line the streets, reporters reportin'
Mafia ties, drugs and extortion
DeLucas vs. Stark-iano, headline the news
Police pull war on crime, they're gonna lose
Judges get kidnapped, captains get decapitated
Starks rise above all to be emancipated
Black Godfather, families at war
Drive bys and Molotovs settle the score
Butcher shops are filled with chopped up casualties
I made sure to keep guns in all my faculties
The streets run red when the bosses disrespect us
Neglected, I guarantee no man's protected
To each his own, grab a gun off the shelf
Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self


Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self
Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self


How you prepare for war? Grab your guns and your hardware
Never close your eyes in the barber chair
The heart of a lion, that's what got him here
Bulletproof the car, yo, we outta here
Fuck the DeLucas, we've got shooters with submachines
Bone-crushing niggas like a football team, under a new regime
The old we throw it out, spin back the hammer, let the lord sort 'em out
Keep your gun cocked, at the whorehouse, sip the brown liquor
While we move a quarter ounce, pick the territories
Move north or south, the high power shine, yours is watered down
I'm underground, with the vest is on, open up your head
Now your flesh is torn, never turn my back up at restaurants
Put holes in your chest, come test the don
45 in my holster, let me stretch my arms




So the DeLucas want Tone? Nah, not today
Cock and spray, side with 'em and you've got to pay
Don't even kill 'em, just make 'em feel a lot of pain
Stake out his wife and his seed at the soccer game
Greet 'em with open arms, beat 'em with no regard
Feed 'em two two-threes, freeze 'em, leave 'em with no resolve
Make a lead on me, repping for the territory
No stepping on me, brethren that's a negatory
You want a war? These men pop dangerous
Taking all in a 10 block radius
Murder rate double, triple, cripple the strip
Like it got hit with a couple of missiles
8 will fly through your door, I'll get in your crib
In a wig, in a cable guy uniform
My shooters maneuver, we've got DeLuca in the scope
Moving close, say the word, Tone, dude is ghost




Bird flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze drifting by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for...
Bird flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze drifting by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me


Who be the last man standin' when I cock back the cannon? (Bobby!)
And blast your ass in search for Michael Landon (and)
Abandon ship, you can't penetrate (and)
My solar eclipse, you dickhead y'all get pussy-whipped (and)
Sword of Conan, wind speed of Rodan(and)
Flow so cold, I freeze M.C.'s to snowmen (and)
Turn 'em up to the sun to defrost them (and)
Proceed with caution, you get your beans baked in Boston (and)
Slice a lemonhead, it's like John Lennon said (and)
Help, you need somebody and (and)
If you ever see somebody and (and)
Fuckin' with the Wu, you gonna be a body and (and)
By me, myself and Bobby and (sha na na) (and)
You superficial nigga, fuck it I'm a superhero (and)
My pistol will turn you to a super zero (and)
Make a fingetip griplock of Royce Gracie (and)
While I'm makin' this cash like Mr. Spacely (and)
Or Cogswell Cogs, I don't fuck with hogs (and)
Your dialogue is stuck, too analog (and)
Is you guns heavy enough? (and)
Is your gold chain truck Chevy enough? (and)
Don't fuck around with Starks, Rebel and us (and)
B-O-B-B-Y (sha na na) (and)
You superficial nigga, buck it I'm a superhero (and)
My super pistol will turn you to a super zero (and)
Lot of niggas askin' us, some faxin' us (and)
How I gladiate, take land like Maximus (and)
You listerin', while this winds blisterin' (and)
I'm in the clouds like my man Calrissian (and)
Lando, bust shots like Marlon Brando (and)
You gettin' smacked like I'm playin' black Sambo (and)
Hambone, hambone, haven't you heard? (and)
Papa gonna buy you a mockingbird (and)
If that mockingbird don't sing (and)
Papa gonna buy you a diamond ring (and)
Watch out for the Killa Bee sting (and)
BZA-Bobby (sha na na)


You see that's what we called B-Boy freestyle!
You stupid muthafucka!!!

"and" "Bobby!" (repeated to the end)

"sha na na!"




Come and get some, you want none
Y'all niggas wanna bring it, get done
Flashback, '88 rag type Volvo
One court solo, slash for logo
200 hyenas roam the arena
Schemin on a truck Chevy, quick to rush every
Criminal mental, satanic pen pal
Wild style on your wax for ten thou'
Most notable, Hip Hop quotable
See many went, only one got a show to do
Floor soakin wet with the drinks and dance sweat
Tell me which click got the deadliest handset
I make the mic pump, force make your feet stomp
Murderous beats move like rope for you to jump
And the two-inch, tighten with the wool-wrench
None qualifyin ass-niggas, the Jon Bentz
Spend it real, 'nuff festivals on the grill
Got a deal, no return with the Brook Shield


Breaker, Breaker 1-9, can't rhyme
Y'all niggas wanna shine, get offline


Yo, I use and abuse all groups and crews
I can't lose, straight up and down, I'm bad news
Like the bears, we folks from under the stairs
Pack a hand trigga, scared niggas don't dare
From the rear, I smash through like a John Deer
Plant a bomb in ya ear then disappear
With a speed that'll reach mach five
Niggas pop jive, that's why they on the opposite side
Dick riders tryin to make their way inside
Boy analyze, my camp be amplified
Certified live, right before your third-eye
Supply the mental high for the fiendish
Thru the intervenus, see it like a wide-screen Zenith
Got sweetness, wanna show me your cleavage
Leave it to the specialist, leave your wig split
Leavin no witness, it's a mean business
We mean business, invest in cream
Till my exit scene, I stay plottin on my next scheme


Next scheme
Blessed with the art to pierce and shoot dart
I toke the bass, put your shovel to the Rebel
Allah Just, embrace his face with the metal
Danger, woman adore to the chamber
Let this nigga run out wild with the banger
Hip Hop socialize, enterprise, snubs in the club
Twenty wizards, about 300 niggas inching your square
Or could it be the armory?
Fifty-two low hand, touch the ground
Strike his knee, pass the heat to my man
Windmill backhand bust your nose gland
Mic stand, might crash a wild fan
The Aqua, city of Atlantis, mantis, flying locusts
Surround the oppose, a bomb only has one time to explode
I blow and break and quake your whole state
Throw the shit on DAT, and make me a fuckin tape






Ol' Dirty kickin' your ass
The things that you learnt in class, is trash
You can't do nothing with it, I put you in the past
The pilgrim muthafuckas -- shut the fuck up!
I do it to you bad luck, the hair get plucked
The only thing on your brain is to give me this cash
And stay out of business, cuz I'm takin' your cash
This world belong to me, none of y'all free
I got y'all in -- slavery
The habit of breathing, the hope to find
That you're misbehaving, Link your Cuban
Fuck your booing, flash the burners
On your crewing, cuz I'm much different from
The other M.C.'s, I got the amazing ability
I get on the mic, so you can have a ball (break that break)
I can fly through the air and stick to the wall
I can take a punch, or get hit by a car
Could go to the nearest or farthest star
As a matter of fact, that's what I won't talk about
How I'm going outer space, just to be in the house
How I'm going outer space, ---- -- be in the house


Break that break (nah-nah-nah-nah)


I'm that mic enhancer, the beat programmer
When Ason Unique speak, he throw hammers
And we go bananas over old school breaks
I take an old school loop and break it on yo face
I start from a clean slate, bang you on the waistline
Deep Space Nine, Math smash the bass line
I break spines, til they fraction or splinter
I want Michael Jackson money, just a fraction of Thriller
Deep in, the laboratory, manufacture the Zilla
Cock, notch category, capture the realer
We the ex-drug dealers, still serving them fiends
With TV's in the car, the size of movie screens
You know the routine, give 'em what they need
That disco shit, satisfaction guaranteed




Yeah, 1-2-3, microphone check
In the place to be, as you can see
This is Wu-Tang Clan guest starring M.C
With no harm intended, nobody offended
Carry on with the social, nothing but a party tonight
Special invite, ladies free before midnight
We lock the club down, clash sound hear the guns pop
See D.J.'s spin, counter clock, keep gridlocked
Line around the block, women by the flock
Wanna party with the great, I reap Jamel
Ring bells throughout the state
Diggin' in the crates, for the old school
Remix, nice it up for the people
Ladies want the hardest stiff, to spread eagle






"Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu-Tang sword style. If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous. Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?"
"En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style."


Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!


Ghostface catch the blast of a hype verse
My Glock burst, leave in a hearse, I did worse
I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk
Your head rush, fly like Egyptian musk
Aww shit, Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks, and
However I master the trick just like Nixon
Causin' terror, quick damage your whole era
Hardrocks is locked the fuck up or found shot
P.L.O. style, hazardous 'cause I wreck this
Dangerous, I blow spots like Waco, Texas


I watch my back like I'm locked down
Hardcore-hittin' sound
Watch me act bugged and tear it down
Illiterate-type asshole, songs goin' gold
No doubt, and you watch a corny nigga fold
Yeah, they fake and all that, carryin' gats
But yo, my Clan rollin' like forty macks
Now you act convinced, I guess it makes sense
Wu-Tang, yo, soooo represent!
I wait for one to act up, now I got him backed up
Gun to his neck now, react what?
And that's one in the chamber
Wu-Tang banger, 36 styles of danger


Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!

I rip it hardcore, like porno-flick bitches
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's bangin'
Wu-Tang slang'll leave your headpiece hangin'
Bust this, I'm kickin' like Seagal: out for justice
The roughness, yes, the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder one, my style shock your knot like a stun-gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty-ass nigga, with my nigga the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pulled like a trigger
So bad, stabbin' up the pad with the vocab, crab
I scream on your ass like your dadbring it on!


Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!


Yo, I'm more rugged than slaveman boots
New recruits, I'm fuckin' up MC troops
I break loose, and trample shit, while I stomp
A mudhole in that ass 'cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creepin' up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin' through your back *swish*
Givin' bystanders heart-attacks
Niggas try to fliptell me, who is him?
I blow up his fuckin' prism
Make it a vicious act of terrorism
You wanna bring it, so fuck it
Come on and bring the ruckus!
And I provoke niggas to kick buckets
I'm wettin' cream, I ain't wettin' fame
Who sellin' cain? I'm givin' out a deadly game
It's not the Russian, it's the Wu-Tang crushin' roulette
Slip up and get fucked like Suzette
Bring da fuckin' ruckus!


Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!


"En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style."
So, bring it on! So, bring it on!

Punk nigga!

Bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus


Something new from my real live raps and so catch this
While I kick a verse like chapters
I'm all of that, proceed with the militant act
With the rugged Timberlands or with boots that's black
But on the real, I'm cold like blue steel
Out to catch a hit and make a mill, chill
Maintain yourself Black, you're strapping all of that
But you ain't got shit in this shack Jack
That's my word, I'm used to beef and I can eat it mad raw
And pick it out my gold teeth
But yo back to the subject, Wu's trying to get wrecked yo
Pass the weed thru your shit god mic check, need a little meth yo
True, back to me flipping you and your so called zoo
You got nothing on a nigga from Staten
A drunk monk, smoking mad skunk and stacking
I didn't need rap shit to get me on, I was a crimey
Driving a Benz hearing my man's song
And when shit gone broke out, everybody got smoked out
And cops drove the wrong route
Don't act evil and possess to hurt me, forty guns be flowing in your face
Who wants some




I rip it hardcore, like porno-flick bitches
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's banging
Wu-Tang slang'll leave the microphone hanging
Bust this, I'm kicking like Segall, Out for Justice
The roughness, yes the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder one, my style shot your knot like a stun-gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigger
So bad, stabbing up the pad with the vocab, crab
I scream on your ass like your dad, bring it on




Yo, I'm more rugged than slaveman boots
New recruits, I'm fucking up MC troops
I break loops, and trample shit, while I stomp
A mudhole in that ass, cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creeping up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fucking dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Chopping through your back
Giving bystanders heart-attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me who is him

Make it a vicious act of terrorism
You wanna bring it, so fuck it
Come on and bring the ruckus

Bobby, I'm tired of yo' shit, nigga!
I'm tired of you comin' in at 3 o'clock in the mornin'
Nigga, you got a family here
You act like you don't fuckin' know that shit
Nigga, what the fuck?

Born up in Kings County


Digital, these niggas should be crazy
Growin' up as a Brooklyn baby
This how, this is my life..


Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo, YO
A Brooklyn baby, I was born up in King's County
Inside the womb seven months before the Queen found me
Up in wroughty Brownsville with fiends around me
Now roam gat in Staten with Cream Team around me
They called me Bobby, Cousin Billy got the black Harley
Taught his son how to snipe cats like Lee Harvey
Oswald, all's well that ends well
My big brother Divine, he pushed the Benz well
I got the cherry Range, known for rockin' heavy chains
I'm from the tribe of men who would bury Kings
On the back of the A-train, my daydream
Should I make a phat hit or should I take CREAM?
From the Clan that taught you cats Cash Rules
I make slow grind tracks, you grab ass too
Give respect to the Prince when he pass through
Might have a chocolate deluxe in a glass shoe
Cousin Billy, known to strap the black uzi
Shoot you in front of the Jakes like Jack Ruby
Live on TV where you see B-O-B-B-Y
D-I-G-I-T-A-L (A-L!), things ain't too well




Digital, these niggas should be crazy
Growin' up as a Brooklyn baby
This is how I live my life..


Yeah..
Peace Lafyetee, Stuyvessant, Malcolm X
Shot dice on green, we live from Pulaski y'all
It's Fred Glassy, zig-zag-zig through traffic
Get the herb, get the God, peace Ra'
What's the word on things?
Through the phone I heard the bangin' sounds
In the background, layin' down
I'm spittin' what the people missin'
We extreme with the murder type theme
Don't sleep, get ya head split to the white meat
Big guns, down South we blaze
Shippin' bodies back up North, it's the Weston
Wild Texan, no trespassin'
Long mics hit the dead arm
Planet Earth, home of Islam
Brooklyn, I was physically born, clothes torn
Rough tacklin' the streets, Allah Math' spin techniques
We bring heat to the block party, drinkin' Bacardi
Baggin' shorties for the homies who ain't here




Bobby, that's right, you ain't shit, nigga
You ain't shit, but a big dick and a mothafuckin' cheque
All that fuckin' Brooklyn shit, Shaolin shit
Nigga, grow the fuck up!
What the fuck is up with you, nigga?
You ain't shit, nigga
Comin' in high off that shit
What the fuck?
I'm tired of yo' shit
What the fuck is that shit anyway?
What the fuck?
And your cousin Billy, I'm sick of that mothafucka
That mothafucka could never come up in this
Mothafuckin' house ever again
He's a criminal mothafuckin' gangsta, see that shit?
A criminal, I'm sick of that shit
I'm sick of yo' shit, Bobby {*echoes*}
Brooklyn this, Shaolin that
What the fuck, nigga?
I don't know why I love your stupid ass anyway
Pssh.. but I do love you Bobby




Today I'll talk about kindness
Justice, faith, and kindness
I want you to listen carefully
Kindness and faith, are the foundation
Without them, we can't become good people
And with justice, we know we can lead a good life
And how can I be a good man then, eh?
Huh... well, first of all, you have to practice honesty
Mmm?
Keep your temper, never lose control of yourself
Keep control
Be patient, if you learn to do these things, you can master anything


Out of nowhere, there came a caravan
This was around a campfire light
A lovely woman in motion
Her hair was as dark, as the night


Cruisin on the interstate, just follow while I innovate
Too many try and imitate, medallion like a dinner plate
Front and get your dinner ate, chinchilla for the winter, wait
I'm tryin to bring the "Sexy Back" like Timbaland and Timberlake
Spittin like a calico, kush from a Cali ho
Tell that joker "tally ho", put shots in that Denali yo
RZA you know how we go on them 20's, that's how we roll
And I don't eat berries but eat a Berry like Halle though
The game criminal, my, my chain figaro
My, my dame's pigeon-toed, I'm still the same nigga though
Uh, kid rock a fitted low, still got a wicked flow
And I'm like Barry Bonds on anything that RZA throw


On anything that RZA throw, Ironman's invisible
I left my chick for cheatin on me, now that bitch is miserable
Poppin bottles, paintin hella Wallo's on my physical
We gon' have a ball, might as well pick a testicle
Purple haze festivals, smoke a nigga like a bowl
Fuck a coma, now the state you layin is a vegetable
You wanna see me? Like you ain't checkable?
You like a CD, I burn you and I wrecked a few...




Only God, has lept into avenged mind
And can distinguish, good, from evil
Ha ha ha ha

 Aye Yo Cappa!!


We gotta get more cake together, so we could branch out
Preserve land, get a boat and a ranch house
Call me a dreamer, but I hustle for real
You thought that I fell off but now I'm attackin the field
All in Chicago, grindin, puttin it down
Crush blocks of MC's, I ain't playin around
Yo you heard me on The Bassment, givin it to 'em
Fake dudes hidin theyself, but I could see through 'em
Diggler, what? I'm tryin to live and raise kids
While you throwin up ya sign, I'm layin 'em down kid
Plus I'm back home now, doin my thing
Thirty dollars to Medina just to cop me a ring




A good friend, holds his drink
Bad company makes bad wine!
Drinking among friends
Red wine means a good life
A few drinks bring comfort
Two drinks are enough!
Money can't buy courage!
Riches mean nothing to us!
Brilliant, a display of genius




Hey, you know, everybody's talking about the "good old days," right? Everybody! The good old days
Well, let's talk about the good old days!


Know what I'm sayin'?
Take you on this lyrical high real quick
1993 exoticness, know what I'm sayin'?
Let's get technical; where's your bone at?
Get up on that shit, a'ight? Yo!


Started off on the island, aka Shaolin
Niggas wilin', gun shots thrown, the phone diallin'
Back in the days, I'm 8 now
Makin' a tape now, Rae gotta get a plate now
Ignorant and mad young, wanted to be the one
'Til I got (Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!) felt one
Yeah, my pops was a fiend since 16
Shootin' that "that's that shit!" in his blood stream
That's the life of a grimy, real-life crimey
And niggas know that habit's behind me
Day one, yo, growin' all up in the ghetto
Now I'm a weed fiend jettin' to Palmetto
In Medina, yo, no doubt, the god got crazy clout
Pushin' the big joint from down South
So if you're filthy stacked up, better watch your back and duck
'Cause these fiends, they got it cracked up
Now my man from up North, now he got the loft
It's solid as a rock and crazy salt
No jokes, I'm not playin', get his folks
Desert Eagle his dick and put him in a yoke
And to know for sure, I got reck and rip shop
I pointed a gat at his mother's knot
(Yo, Rae, don't do that shit, man! Don't do that shit!)
Fuck that!


Dedicated to the winners and the losers
(Dedicated to all Jeeps and Land Cruisers)
*Can it be that it was all so simple then?*
Dedicated to the 5's, 850i's
(Dedicated to niggas who do drive-by's)
*Can it be that it was all so simple then?*
Dedicated to the Lexus and the Ac's
(Dedicated to MPV's: phat!)


Kickin' the fly clichs, doin' duets with Rae and A
Happens to make my day
Though I'm tired of bustin' off shots, havin' to rock knots
Runnin' up in spots and makin' shit hot
I'd rather flip shows instead of those
Hangin' on my livin' room wall, my first joint and it went gold!
I want to lamp, I want to be in the shade
Plus the spotlight, gettin' my dick rode all night
I want to have me a phat yacht
And enough land to go and plant my own sess crops
But for now it's just a big dream
'Cause I find myself in a place where I'm last seen
My thoughts must be relaxed, be able to maintain
'Cause times is changed and life is strange
The glorious days is gone and everybody's doin' bad
Yo, mad lives is up for grabs
Brothers passin' away, I gotta make wakes
Receivin' all types of calls from Upstate
Yo, I can't cope with the pressure, settlin' for lesser
The God left lessons on my dresser
So I can bloom and blossom, find a new way
To continue to make more hits with Rae and A
Sunshine plays a major part in the daytime
Peace to mankind, Ghostface carry a black 9, nigga
Word up, it's all like that yeah)




It's like this, I'ma start from the top
Inspectah Deck, he's like
He's like that dude that'll sit back and watch you
Play yourself and all that, right?
And see you sit there and know you lyin'
And he'll take you to court after that
'Cause he the Inspectah, that's why he the and
And also he the Rebel I.N.S.
You know what I'm sayin'?
And Shallah Raekwon, he the Chef
He cookin' up some marvelous shit to get your mouth waterin'
On some "oh shit"

Basically Method Man is like
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it

Know what I'm sayin'? And and, the RZA
He the sharpest motherfucka in the whole Clan
He always on point, razor sharp
With the beats, with the rhymes, whatever, any DJ


And the GZA, the G is just the Genius
He, he's the backbone of the whole shit


It's self-explanatory, Genius, word


He the head, let's put it that way
We form like Voltron, and GZA happen to be the head
You know what I'm sayin'?


Yeah, yeah, that's cool
So what's like, I mean what's like
Your ultimate goal against in this in this industry?


Domination, baby, fuck that


Can I say this one? Can I say this one?
Right now, right now, we still, we still
Feel like we ain't get what we want yet
When we get, when we get, when we get a little props
And really really get the way we gotta go
That's when you know it's on
You know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause right about now, I ain't braggin' or nothin'
But yo, the Wu, the Wu got somethin'

We gon' keep goin'


Yeah, 'cause we tryin' to do all this
We tryin' to make a business outta this, man
We ain't tryin' to-- know what I'm sayin'?
Affiliate ourselves with them fake-ass A&Rs and all that
We tryin' to make our own shit
So that when our children, word
So that when our children, all our seeds and whatever
They got somethin' for theyselves right there


We ain't tryin' to hop in and hop out right quick

We out for the Gusto, and we gon' keep it raw
You know what I'm sayin'? (Word)




Wait, hold up, chill, what's that, son?
Damn nigga got fucked, shit, huh?!
By his back, watch nigga run
Seven the center of your eight point Sun
Hold tight grip on the God-U Now, you best be careful!
Can't dodge two Self-Hes aimed at your domepiece
Father-U-C-King police!!


Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum
Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum


Yo, Rae it's been a long time son since we bust gun
Clap glaciers, ran the world and snatched paper
Return to the 36th Chamber
Proceed with caution as you enter
We have an A.P.B. on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a master


Yo something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang thang
Something in the street went BANG BANG..


Up in the boss game wilding, money for grabs
I ain't fucking with crabs, out of state copped two labs
Hopped two cabs, back on the Ave
Stab you with the vocab, catch me at the big dough rehab
Tryna re-up, keep my feet up
Snake niggas in the cut, hold the product
Time is up, no luck, heat start to bust
Niggas you can't trust, dealing with lust
Seen him at the ballgames with James


Something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang thang
Something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang


Something in the hall went {Click Click}
The boxcutter went {Click Click}
Something in the hole went {Click Click}
The boxcutter went {Click Click}


These are the bones, bones from the grave of Houdini
G-Deini, Ronzoni noodles sprinkled on your embry'
Climb like the deficit, profits, death threats
To Israel slid through Bethlehem bong on one wheel
Syringes, rubber bands, needles, the 60's
Granddaddy Caddy was copping 6 G's
B'gosh all that Oshkosh jumpers
Pink Champelle, brown paper bags, wall to wall bumpers


These ain't the camera guys, cause, turn your eyes
Sweat on the hammer fly, Ways of the Samurai
Newsflash bulletin, Gods on the prowl
We full again, ruff men scuff Timbs
Sonic bionic lens, RZA console
Is it Bush or the Dole, front row of the Superbowl
Black gold in my soul, on a ho stroll
Don't go boy you on parole you don't know?


Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK


Made 'em throw they hands up but then lay flat
Rat pack eat up, the average alley cat
Prepare for the impact when we contact
Known to drop facts that crack your hard hat
Must I show and prove, trust I, bust I
Make your head spin like chrome 20's on the buggy-I Benz
Who contends, Wu like the Superfriends
Who's your rhyming hero? Wu-Tang rules again


Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK

Shake them niggas


Scary hours no money out, smash the Guinness Stout
Play the outfield, Lucille, switched cracks on shields
She's a rich fiend sacrifice her fam shift them niggas
To Queens
Guess jeans she charged thirty-five beans
Hit the cell phone, regulate with well known Tone
A Wally kingpin who also slam the strike edition
What up? Corleone smoke the bone, Tone phone me
What up? He tried to slang there, address him with chrome only
Grady with the gray beard, transporting for him
Rocking Nike Air, Rastafarian bird, piping that
Switchin Benzes, ten carat nigga with gold lenses
Fronting like he's sitting on a lump, he's sitting on junk
You wanna pull a heist, draw guns and robberies
You wanna rock rep, step in yellow Wallabies
Names arraigned, they're Century Fox, little Glocks
Them niggas with stocks, ______ blocks
Rich lifestyle, spoiled like an ordinary white child
But right now, Sun it still shine, shed light now
Breakdown, liquidate God, fucking grab the nickel plate
'Spenser: For Hire', tension when we mention Dryer
He's a slave cop, behave pop
Isuzu Beige Top will blow that cat at the Purple Haze spot


I remember sticking fiends at the one-six-ooh
When we was starving, ducking five-oh, paying 'em dues
Times is hard in the slums I'm from, they got us barred in
We warring and cage dodging, ripping and robbing
Got the NARC sabotaging, slipping cracks in
Your camoflouging, now you snitching on the squadron
That's something niggas can't pardon
City overrun by young gun with bad intention and Wu-Wear garment
So I see no need to mention, the potency
Of a sting from a killa bee, kicking the battery
Out the back of them wisecracks
Distorted for your get high, you hijack
These friendly skies ain't for you, they for me and mine
This the year of the grimy nigga, ragtime
Keep these niggas on the run, peep my Clan emblem
Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from


Catch us swimming with these sharks now, you rap villains
(I feel the same way you niggas feeling)
We feel the same way you feeling, let it be known (let it be known)
What the blood clot you niggas dealing, you crash dummies
Cash rules, still don't nothing move but the money


Aiyyo strongarm that kid right there with wavy hair
Billy Johnson snatched him out his whip in Times Square
Took his Pumas, nameplate, dude lost weight
Summer '88, started a fight, that can't wait
Ask Dorothy, same kid pussy up in Marcy
Blazing that Ted Rossi up in The Marquees
He lost like a hundred ounces, Jake rushed his houses
Had him on the porch, ass no trousers
This souped up, individual stuck, the new stuff
Same kid crying on the stand with Judge Cuffner
Kissed him with odd numbers three to nine style
Before he left he flashing his face like Denzel
Richard Dale took his Beaver, underwall balling his whip
Mussy dropped and split his wig with the heater
His shape-up was all fucked up, as he had me laughing
God you see how he was laid out in the grass
With dirt in his mouth, Slim woke him up told him he wild out
Blood leaking from his teeth he smiled like he gummed out
Big bolo, stacking his shit, financed a Volvo
He copped his shit from a small coffee shop in SoHo
He still pussy, he sell his dust up on the Lower East
Posing like he rapping out...




I must tell you that the Clan is a danger to the public
But still for many men just to hear of the name
Fills them with hate and loathing
But why? They've never harmed anyone
I'm afraid they did
*beat drops*
In the past there's something that they would like to forgive
First, I'll tell you about their style, planned techniques
The main style
"Shaolin Finger Jab!"


Yo..
*sounds of fighting*
(Uh-huh)


We are watchin your whole group
You been busy here
Around the clock, all we need is your orders to move
Met a lot of crosses last night
Young and old!
You been busy here
I respect that!


Yeah, (Eh yo), yeah
Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in (Yo)
Come on! You know what it is
(Thou must bust shots all the time, kid)
(Eh yo, eh yo, eh yo) We're back!


Peep The Jump Off, ain't nothin sweet, get dumped off
Frontin like you won't get deaded and bumped off
Drastic son, master guns that'll run up in plastic ones
And then go, crash in the slums
One tight army, few good men that'll rep
Invade you strongly, Prince of Wales swimmin on feet
Props'll sell, all yellow L's, cops sleepin on nails
Niggas get realer than real, yo
Flash the brown, last time was crowned
All navy Woolridge, Wu kicks, movin them pounds, yo
Last on niggas, great adventures of my niggas
And Castro pictures, sendin a rash out the kitchens
Like the wind, invite the grin, watch niggas rewrite the trend
Wu niggas did it again, yo
Unhighly, octane, die cast metal frame
Lame, let another man with heat handle beef


Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in


Yo, spark the intro, relevant info
Load up the keyboard, 105 tempo
Most heated battles, I've blasted MCs
Some said that the bullets flew by like angry bees
Wu entered on the level where we would wait and listen
While one flashed metal, eight calculate position
The world snapped, once we combined our rap
Drastic measures, priceless treasures on Nap'
Our swords swing, windchill Mount Aerie
Native plant standin' on the tall-grass prairie
Snares and kicks, off the project bricks
It's no act the producer played the role with drumsticks
The warning came unnoticed
It's like the shot on the dock of the bay
That slayed Otis, the Nine-Lotus
Each one adjust to his own environment
Formulate this great LP, a hundred rounds spent
Niggas bent on the fruitless search for nourishment
They long for this proper guidance, encouragement




It be the Lost Tribe, 7 days locked in the dungeon
Foamin at the mouth, mad dog in this production
The uncontrolled substance got me spittin up bars disgustin
The last temptation of the son of David Ruffin
Hold my mic sideways when bustin
On Judgement Day runnin through Hell, yellin and cussin
At MC's in my circumfrance, y'all niggas hand-cuffin
These hoes and ain't read them they rights or nothin
Keep lustin, yeah and I'ma a keep hustlin
With Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in
You know me, everytime you kiss that ho you blow me
You blow trial trin to walk a mile in my Sauconys




We just touched down, Wu shuttle, private jet
Stepped off the plane, the world wept
Roll with the Witty Unpredictable
Talent All Natural, rock with the beatles of hip-hop
Mathematical imperial manifestation of greatness
Make wiz's scream and shout at the top of their breath essence
Captured on tape is precious
Bless mic pure deafness, awaken from you sleep mistake
When the God bring rain, hail, snow to the earthquake




You've been busy
Are you mastered?
{*Repeat 3x*}
You've been busy here..




Yeah, yo, what up yo?
Yeah, yeah, what up?
Nothin', man, hold on
Someone beepin' on my other line and shit
Nigga, I've seen everything I wanted to see
Come on son, yo, in my Range Rover runnin' out this muthafucka and shit
I be there in ninety minutes, aight, I make a stop
Aight, peace, one-one


I'm up in the Cherry Range, drivin' fast through heavy rains
My mind's on everything, my Wiz, my seed, the five pounds of weed
My dog got bagged with tryin' to sling in D.C
My cell phone rings off the hook: "brrring!"
"Kinetic 9: Yo, what's the word, king?"


Duckin' lights, b.s. and problems, pushin' through Holland Tunnel
Tryin' to avoid getting caught up in the funnel
'Cuz in the jungle, sometimes you gotta rumble
With the, the Beez...


... That's why we study degrees
And keep our third eye open for c-cypher punks
Will bag you for a blunt and lock you up for a month
You've seen Bird? You had beef with that chump
And I heard he came home from a two-year slump


Yeah, I heard, I got the pump in the trunk
And when I see that crab, I'm a dump in his lump
'Cuz niggas ain't shit but welfare cheese


With their food stamp bitches and their coupon seeds


Frontin' with their platinum like they're O's and G's


When faced with the gat, niggas pose and freeze
And melt like snow on my windshield, that windmills
In my mind spin, they give skin chills
Yo, son, we gotta make them deals
For ten mill's so we can pay them bills, yo


You wanna eat how we wanna eat, live how we wanna live
Be what we wanna be, give what we wanna give
Say what we wanna say, play how we wanna play
Teach what we wanna teach, do what we gotta do
Eat how we wanna eat, live how we wanna live
Be what we wanna be, give what we wanna give
Say what we wanna say, play what we wanna play
Teach what we gotta teach, lay where we wanna lay
Do what we gotta do, eat how we wanna eat
Live how we gotta live, be what we wanna be
Give what we gotta give, say what we wanna say
Play anywhere we play, teach where we gotta reach
Do what we gotta do, lay where we wanna lay
Stay where we wanna stay, pay who we wanna pay
And get our record played, on the radio
Airwaves, without havin' to pay the fuckin' D.J.!


Say what you wanna say, do what you wanna do
Eat how you wanna eat, be what you wanna be
Live how you wanna live, give what you wanna give
Play where you wanna play, stay where you wanna stay



Now how does one run smoothly after getting an ex
No more asking y, but I guess its on to the next
Abcs messed up cause u and I were the best
Still have all that love in me, I gotta confess
Relationships are dumb with no you -done with em
Now I got so many things to prove- a ton of em
Like how I love your smile
And the feeling of your touch
Please stay for a while
Im not asking for much

On the phone late at night
Your voice makes me comfortable
I read of love at first sight
how can one be gullible
Then I saw you
Damn that chic is lovable
My heart started beating
Im in love
Im in trouble
Flirty text messages
Trying to be subtle
Hugs turned to kisses and
Kisses turned to cuddles

Not much for me to do
This I was prepared for
Here to say I love you still
Girl you got me airborne

2X- Chilling here in the atmosphere thats where your love takes me
Push me away, got nothing to say, I want you back, youre my baby

Sorry if your listening
And think that this is corny
The thought of you takes me away
I wish you would of warned me

Baby its cold out side
Let me hold you warmly
I dont need this sweater
Maybe you can wear it for me

Im missing all those walks
That we had around town
Your presence is a present
With you, I could never frown
In your love in which I downed
With my heart upon my crown
You were the queen to my king
Let me show you around

This is where my heart goes
Remember? Cause you took it
Now you wanna give it back
Where was the problem girl?
Im lookin
Youre the queen up in my castle
Ill be out there crooken
Wanna spend a night together
Where you wanna go im lookin

Every road has a bump
We need to make it over
Youre the key to the ignition
Youre the movement to my motor
The highway of life
Speeding, baby we passing it
Ill tell you one thing
Theres no other I would travel with

2X- Chilling here in the atmosphere thats where your love takes me
Push me away, got nothing to say, I want you back, youre my baby




Woke up this morning, smoked some sticky green to get me started
Choclate thai, all in my eye, I'm never broken-hearted
Bang us in ya cars, bang us in ya Jeep, bang that shit retarded


(Bob Digi) Sun Zeini
(P. Sunn) 12 O'Clock
Two On Da Road on this (12 O'Clock)
I love my brother to death
(That old hip-hop, catch this)
(Hot Nix', you know? Big tits)


I love my brother to death, nigga pussy to the rest
Shared a pair of Guess and an Eddie Bauer vest
A bitch named Celeste
I met her when I was goin to cash a Def Jam check
She had some big ass breasts
I had to catch her like a shortstop on the Mets
A nigga high off a dime from Gates and Best
Remember grandmother live on Louis and Lex
I remember Dirt Dog crashed his white Lex
I remember me and Meth won a dice game against Ghost and Deck
Remember Portland had Clyde Drex'
Remember 12 O'Clock is a vet
Big Dogs we put 'em to sleep, keep 'em on a leash
I move like days in a week
Niggas don't know the face and names on my teeth
Niggas carry a cold piece, and separate the heat
Ain't scared of the motherfuckin police


Yo, yo
Guns jammed up, I'm cramed up in my lab
Six niggas, six bitches, two fifths and eight bags
One toilet, three weedheads, an alcoholic
And two niggas hooked on pussy
And in the corner, was this brother who would study his lessons
And learned how operate the Smith and the Wesson
Still cut class and played hookey
Threw freshmens in garbage cans, gave 'em nookies
Rolled the, back of the bus with a gun in his socks
Big forehead, had ears like Spock
He was mightier than a truckload of gats
And bound to make a bitch cum in six minutes flat


What up kid? Stay livin
Seen you look good, you look live in ya linen
And you survived ninth innin
The hood got us off the prop without women
All my niggas that ride that provide to the end of this


Ain't nothin but the real, yeah
Ain't nothin but the real
Ain't nothin but the real, yeah
Million dollar deals, rollin on Chrome Wheels


Yeah, uh-huh, yeah (Ain't nothin but the real)
This one's on P. Sunn, word up? Yeah, uh-huh


We gamble the dice
Remain humble, scramble through the jungle of life
While the we rumble with the foul and trife
Shots fired on the block in threes like Glen Rice
Made men think twice about the sacrifice
Black on white, write it for the world to hear
Write it for my fam who not here who do care
Glance and stare, why when you can't compare?
From the bottom of my feet to the end of my hair
Move rear, cop the blue steel bare, groove to the snare
Bass and drums, see my face in the slums
Pedia Brown, media surround my sound
When you see me in the hood of ya town, respect my sound
Sample with black, criminal, mechanical rap
Assemblin hat, laced in a suit from Phat
Two On Da Road, got them bitches screamin, "Who Dat?"
Two with the plaques, two with the gats, it's like that




Two On Da Road, Bobby Digital
He's a gangsta, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no
Live it up, live it up
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no




Bang us in ya Jeeps
Shaolin! Bobby Digital
Uh-huh, Sunn who?
Yeah
Haha! Yeah!
Get that money y'all
Get that money y'all
Get that money y'all
Shout in pain
Uh-huh, yeah
Weed blazin, cocoa hazin, cocoa hazin

The 4th Disciple, the Brown Hornet
K.D. the Down Low Recka
Shyheim a.k.a. The Rugged Child
Du-Du-Lilz, Mr. Hezekiah
Better known as the Yin and the Yang, the True Master
Isham, DJ Skane, the True Robocop comin' through
Scientific Shabazz, my motherfuckin' man Wise the Civilized
The Shaolin Soldiers, Daddy-O and Popa Ron
Comin' down from the motherfuckin' South end of things
Killa Beez all over your fuckin' planet
Thirty-six chambers of death
Three-hundred and sixty degrees of perfected styles
Choppin' off your motherfuckin' dome
-piece, and every fuckin' borough
Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, Staten Island
The motherfuckin' Bronx, Killa Beez


The sword? C'mon, give him the sword!


Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, rag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, come on in the track to what


The Wu is comin' through, the outcome is critical
Fuckin' with my style is sort of like a miracle
On 34th Street, in the Square of Herald
I gamed Ella, the bitch caught a Fitz like Gerald-
-ine Ferraro, who's full of sorrow
'Cause the ho didn't win, but the sun will still come out tomorrow
And shine shine shine like gold mine
Here comes the drunk monk, with a quart of Ballantine
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone!
Let's get on this mission like Indiana Jones
The GZA, one who just represent the Wu-Tang clique
With the game and soul of an old school flick
Like the Mack and Dolemite, who both did bids
Claudine went to Cooley High and had mad kids
So stop, the life you save may be your motherfuckin' own
I'll hang your ass with this microphone
Make way for the merge of traffic
Wu-Tang's comin' through with full metal jackets
God squad that's mad hard to serve
Come frontin' hard, then Bernhard Goetz what he deserves


Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, rag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, come on in the track to what


No response while I bomb that ass
You ain't shit, your wack-ass town had you gassed
Egos is somethin' the Wu-Tang crush
Souped-up niggas on a stage get rushed
I don't give a goddamn on the shows you did
How many rhymes you got or who knows you, kid
'Cause I don't know you, therefore show me what you know
I come sharp as a blade and I cut you slow
You become so Pat as my style increases
What's that in your pants? Ahh, human feces!
Throw your shitty drawers in the hamper
Next time, come strapped with a fuckin' Pamper
How you sound, B? You're better off a quitter
I'm on the mound, G, and it's a no-hitter
And my DJ, the catcher, he's my man
In a way he's the one who devised the plan
He throws the signs, I hook up the beats with clout
I throw the rhymes to the mic and I strike 'em out
So it really doesn't matter on how you intrigue
You can't fuck with those in the major leagues


Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, rag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, come on in the track to what
Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, rag shit to death

Niggas on the left, brag shit to death

Punks in the back, come on in the track
Clan in da front, let your feet stomp

Call it the Hollow Bone syndrome line
Select sweet nine, face this, watch his whole face lift
Bracelets, murder niggas, luxurious, banks I was draped
Caked out, half a million dollars in coats
Flows is genetic, the Corleone connection in all
Selection, stock brokers with coats on
Make coke suggestion, all twin glizzies
Fireman, Gucci boots on, sideways action
Murder niggas fear me yo
Cash that he did Clinton, rentin his mother crib out
We send organize the Bill of Rights get lid
Drugs that Hendrix was on, conversatin like the Dutch

Flows that blow thru your roll and Holland

Half the year, half my niggas sittin upstairs
Takin pictures of ya niggas wack gear

No yin to my yang, it's a black thing
Used to be in chains, now we snatch chains
Took the crack game applied it to the rap game, y'all
Pop quiz, now, what artist hits the hardest?
Ya down with the syndrome: retarded
I think it was them swordsmen
Place them chess pieces on the boards and
Take it to square, this ain't no Yakool affair
Or a New World Disorder, got us, fuckin the coal miner's daughter
That y'all, but not us




During this time, I intend to teach you the Shaolin poem
The rules and commandments, that void, deceit
Cruelty and unkindness, always help the weak
Never despise the poor, always respect yourself



 Yo butter butter
 Protect Ya Neck baby
 Respect due pa

Alot of record promoters and alot of artists
I mean it's like, it's music that you gotta touch and feel
You know what I'm sayin'
And I think that comes across well in the video
I haven't seen you live yet, I'm waitin for the chance

Old Dirty corporata, splash, I'm up on the punanny flash

That make you wanna roll up and smoke shit y'all
To the beat y'all, you can't sleep y'all
On my flow y'all niggas don't know y'all
You see my style calm but wild
You witness the rhyme, nothin but dimes
The eightball murder verse, freestyle or rehearsed
I wreck emcees whether I'm last or first
What, what, what, what, hazardous dart
Visual long forgotten art
That fell apart, til the blood ran from the heart
Pump through the street, Rza make re-break beats
Packed seats, rapid fire raps at off track meets
And an arm tank, high rank, heavy metal shank
Blow 'em off the plank when they ships approach the bank
Wu niggas rollin, throwin the first rap slogan
Heroes of Hogan, shot up the military clothin'
Quickly blow up, rolled up in rappers like pennies
My brother stack tracks on the behalf of many
With the wisdom, power of, science from experts
Self applyin, that put giants in the network
Through compact discs and televised live quotes
We multiply our strength, on a worldwide note
Yes, what, what


Yes, yes y'all, you don't stop
You keep on, til the break o dawn
Ah yes, yes y'all, you don't stop
Ah Wu-Tang known to make your body rock

Word up, look out for the cops though
Wu-Tang five finger shit
Cash rules-

I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I be gettin' the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this, son
Rollin' with this one and that one
Pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smokin' woolas at 16
And runnin' up in gates, and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
Catchin' keys from 'cross seas
Rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo, nigga, respect mine, or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-POW! Move from the gate now!


Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all


It's been twenty-two long hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask: what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
And ain't tryin' to hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic


Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all


Niggas got to do what they got to do
To get through, know what I'm sayin'?
Because you can't just get by no more
Word up, you gotta get over, straight up and down


Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all




El dinero manda sobre todo a mi alrededor, Cream consigue el dinero
Billetes de dlar para todos



Crec en el lado del crimen, el lado del New York Times
Sobrevivir no era un broma
Tena segundas manos, Mama rechaz al hombre viejo
As que nos mudamos a la tierra Shaolin
Una joven jueventud, meneando el diente de oro, Polo, Goose
La nica manera de conseguir "G off" era la droga
Y vamos a empezar as hijo, yendo con este y con ese
Apretando gatillos por diversion
Pero solo era un sueo de un adolescente que era un diablo
Empec a fumar "woolas" a los 16
Enfrentndome a puertas, y dando golpes por altas inversiones
Haciendo mi camino por salidas de incendios
Sin duda "speedara" por crack y hierba
La combinacin me hizo sangrar los ojos
Sin duda proveera e intentara conseguir toda la pasta
Atracando a chavales blancos en canchas de baloncesto
Mi vida no iba a mejor, el mismo maldito polo
Los tiempos son speros y duros como el cuero
Comprend que haba ido por la ruta incorrecta
As que me hice con locura de panda y sal
Pillando kilos atravs de mares
Dando vueltas en MPV's cada semana ganbamos 40 G's
Hey nigga, respeta lo mo o aqu va el TEC-9
Ch-Chick-POW, muvete por la puerta ahora

 x2



Han sido veintids largos duros aos de seguir en apuros
La supervivencia me tena nervioso, pero estoy vivo a la llegada
Echo un vistazo a la forma de las calles
Y me mantengo despierto para los caminos del mundo porque la mierda es profunda
Un hombre con un sueo, con planes de hacer "cream"
Que fall; fui a la crcel a los 15 aos
Un joven chaval vendiendo drogas y tal, que nunca tuvo mucho
Intentando coger un pedazo de lo que no poda (tocar)
El tribunal me la jug corto, ahora me las veo con el encarcelamiento
Paseando, yendo arriba es mi destino
Esposado en la parte de atrs de un bus, cuarenta de nosotros
La vida de un cro no debera ser tan dura
Pero mientras el mundo giraba aprend que la vida es un infierno
Viviendo en el mundo no diferente a una celda
Cada da escapo de "Jakes" persiguiendo, vendiendo base
Fumando "bones" en la escalera
Aunque no s por qu elijo fumar hierba
Supongo que es el momento en el que no estoy deprimido
Pero sigo deprimido y pregunto para qu vale?
Preparado para rendirme y ver la vieja tierra
Quien explic que trabajar duro puede ayudarte a mantenerte
Para aprender a vencer a la pena y el dolor
Tenemos nios atracadores, policas corruptos, y rocas de crack y
Balas perdidas, todo en el bloque que se mantiene caliente
Djamelo a mi mientras soy prueba viviente
Para ensear la verdad a la joven negra juventud
Pero los cros corriendo salvajes, fumando hierba, bebiendo cerveza
Y sin intentar or lo que les pongo en sus odos
Ignorado por ahora, pero yo, tiene que ser aceptado
El qu? Que la vida es agitada






What you think I'm a fucking worm like you?
I told you, man, I told you, don't fuck with me
I told you, no fucking kids, no, but you wouldn't listen
Well, you stupid fuck, look at you now {Ya'll already know!}
(For real, ya'll, back behind the wall again) {yeah, you know what it is}
(You know what it do, '09 style this time) {It's time to go in now, ya'll}
(For real, making CREAM again, nigga... BLAOW!) {you already know, it's crunch time}


First of all, black park it, guns, we spark it
Hit you in the back of your dome, from far, kid
Dice kickers, gun clickers, run up in the bank for ones, quick
The drug dealer niggas, we flip 'em
Polo rugbies, flags on my hats, you love these
Knockout artists are one-piece
Fly in a foreign, all my money ties is tied-up
I'd rather sell coke, no bargain
Tough like a Hummer, fly like a Maybach
Spot runner, clap you in a gun shop, one up
Fuck about police, we Park Hillians with gold geese
And everyday's a Sunday Easter
Cousins in Gaza, the new improved Shottas
Stretched out, mink on the floor, you hassa
We run through with turbans, diamonded up chain with boots on
Mori umbrellas in Tucson
Rhyming is a color, the lifestyle is live, my fly brothers
Something go wrong, we slug something


Chill my nigga, chill (I got this, I got this)
Make sure you handle that beat, you know what time it is
Body that beat, man, come on (Yeah)


You can catch me anywhere, frost bitten chain
Bad dame, a thousand grams in Delaware
The smokeshop's is owls, laid back, hanging niggas to death
Word, you can call us coat racks
With 'giants' all around me like, Eli Manning
The bitch is on the block like, he died scrambling
Cuz L frames is crack, popped out, nina one of his eyes
Can't come back home, they locked out
All he did was re-up, hustle for kick money
Kept Beez all around him, thinking he shit honey
Bow, I'm into bobsleds, wasting large bread
Gucci helmet is blue, trim in his dark red
The rap TJ Swan, it's me Ason
If he don't spin my shit, break the DJ arm
And glide off like an escapade, renegade on ice
Lemonade Clark, the haze is nice
The Goldielocks, rocks sapphire, chain is right
Bitch niggas, ya'll watch what ya'll say in ya mics, suckas


Aiyo, Rae, aiyo, Rae, check it out, yo
Let me go in there one more time and air these niggas out
For old times sake, you know how we do, my nig'
Old times sake, just for me, man, one more time, I'm begging you
Let me just go in, and just fly on these niggas heads, man
It's what I'm talking about


It's like a body in a project hallway, who did it?
Who's the next nigga that sucked the snit-ich
That's my word, it could never be me
You see the deer head on the living room wall, like his neck fell off
That can be all sculptured and glazed with gloss
Call the shots that Bill Belichick would call
Snake niggas slither all in the glass house, racial slurs
When it's time to go to war, they cash out
Throw 'em in the rear-naked choke, they tap out
Niggas try to surround the kid, I backed out
And threw two rocks at 'em, watching the ho drop
I'm from a place where we locking the low Glocks
Yellowtape, the bodies, jiggy and road blocks
Got the towels up in the air, it's so hot
Talking bout Staten Island, profiling
Switchblade city, the goons is wilding
Escape from my slums, nigga, you got talent
And we don't want the fifth of 'yac, we want the gallon


What you think I'm a fucking worm like you?
I told you, man ---


Vacate black, bust gats, wherever we at
You all that, hit 'em in the chest, we fall back
I got mines, nigga, where yours at?
We call that, raw rap, got fiends in front of my door mat
That Witty Unpredictable fly shit, drive-by shit
These the niggas I ride with
And we gon' get cake, ya'll, as soon as this pie split
Smacking up the dry snitch, nigga, you my bitch
Somebody put Tical on, matter fact, put Tical on
One suuu, Staten Isle on 'em
I bank roll, I break codes, and I ain't trynna catch another case, case closed
Give me my crown, cuz I deserve it, real dudes giving me pounds
But not too close though, the semis'll round
Bitches, running they mouth, goons, running your gate
My team running the block, cops running my plates
Well fuck that, Criminology rap
Niggas hate, I hate back, floating in the flyest Maybach, nigga




You've practiced 20 years? You must be extremely good then
Perhaps, you'll try with me


Come and taste my seasonin', Chef, the cooking that is marvelous
Back over a stove, makin' your mouth water, you starve for this
Exclusive sneakers with hard denim, heavyweight
A neighbor illustrated Alex Haley with paper (paper)
Waves spinnin' like the Titanic, come take a float on
Silky like King Henry VIIIs robe in late spring
Restaurants with skeleton keys, it's big business
Well groomed and elegant posture is real dapper
Status is gigantic, culture's alpaca
Meetings in the Vatican, drinkin' scotch with the Muscle Milk
Praises go to Ason, the dynasty Mr. Russell built
Feed me royal shottas with Glocks, clean 'em with GT Oil
China dolls from Bangkok, we bang 'em, train 'em and make 'em loyal
Trees stank, she come kiss the top of my Yves Saint
Wise-Universal Tang when I bang
Grizzly with the big bank, it's 5 stars, y'all, when I call rank


Egos are somethin' that the Wu-Tang crush
These stupid jealous niggas, y'all 'bout to get rust
This ashes to ashes to dust to dust
These derelict MC's cannot fuck with us, Lord
Egos are somethin' that the Wu-Tang crush
These stupid jealous niggas, y'all 'bout to get rust
This ashes to ashes to dust to dust
These derelict MC's cannot fuck with us, Lord


Rifles out, bear like the Russian
Octagon tuggin' silk drawers frontin', while her head stuntin'
Mulsannes flood the garage
Man the goats launchin' charge cards from Africa
Catch me in the hookah lodge
Brains linked, twisted Cohibas, say the seeds bang
Coffee pots with graveyard rings, flippin' Gs
Yankee hoodlum on the top of the charts
Dart throwers, they're sharks
Everybody run
When my gun barks


Non-athletic anti-semetic synthetic rappers get no credit
Pathetic septic lines, incompetent styles not embedded
Wu-Tang slang bangs in your brain, this is not genetic, prophetic
Unadulterated talent while y'all talk that bullshit rhetoric


Egos are somethin' that the Wu-Tang crush
These stupid jealous niggas, y'all 'bout to get rust
This ashes to ashes to dust to dust
These derelict MC's cannot fuck with us, Lord

Where is the money? Ha ha...




A game of chess is like a swordfight:
You must think first before you move
Toad style is immensely strong
And immune to nearly any weapon
When it's properly used it's almost invincible


Raw I'ma give it to ya, with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
Like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MC's approach with slang that's dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushin' force, my force you're doubtin'
I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains


Well, I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary and carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum, and the isle I'm from
Is comin' through with nuff niggas and nuff guns
So if you wanna come sweatin', stressin', contestin'
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk
I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain, there's no way to barricade me
Steamrollin' niggas like an 18 wheeler
With a drunk driver drivin', there's no survivin'


Rough like Timberland wear, yeah
Me and the Clan in 'Yota Landcruisers out there
Peace to all the crooks, all the niggas with bad looks
Bald heads, braids, blow this hook
We pack chrome TEC's, nickel-plated MAC's
Black AC's, drug-dealin' styles in phat stacks
I only been a good nigga for a minute though
'Cause I got to get my props and win it, yo
I got beef with commercial-ass niggas with gold teeth
Lampin' in a Lexus, eatin' beef
Straight up and down, don't even bother
I got 40 niggas up in here now who kill niggas' fathers


My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Bees on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats


Here I go, deep type flow
Jacques Cousteau could never get this low
I'm cherry bombin' shits BOOM!
Just warmin' up a little bit, vroom vroom
Rappinin' is what's happenin'
Keep the pockets stacked and then, hands clap and then
At the party when I move my body
Gotta get up and be somebody!
Grab the microphone, put strength to the bone
DUH DUH DUHenter the Wu-Tang zone
Sure enough when I rock that stuff
Huff? Puff? I'm gonna catch your bluff tuff
Rough, kickin' rhymes like Jim Kelly
Or Alex Haley, I'm a Mi-Beetle Bailey rhymes
Comin' raw style, hardcore
Niggas be comin' to the hip-hop store
Comin' to buy grocery from me
Tryin' to be a hip-hop MC
The law, in order to enter the Wu-Tang
You must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang
Represent the GZA, Abbot
RZA, Shaquan, Inspectah Deck
Dirty Ol' gettin' low with his flow
Introducin' the Ghostface Killah
No one could get iller


My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats


Speakin' of the Devil, psych!
No, it's the God, get the shit right
Mega trife, and yo, I killed you in a past life
On the mic while you was kickin' that fast shit
You reneged, tried again and got blasted
Half-mastered-ass style, mad ruff task
When I struck I had on Timbs and a black mask
Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack
That night, yo, I was hittin' like a spiked bat
And then you thought I was bugged out, and crazy
Strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy
Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs
Never shot thugs, I'm runnin' with thugs that flood mugs
So, grab your 8 plus 1
Start flippin' and trippin', niggas is jettin', I'm lickin' off, son


Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang!


Homicide's is legal and death is the penalty
One justifies the homicide when he dies in his own iniquity?
It's the master of the Mantis Rapture comin' at ya
We have an APB on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a master
Evidence indicates that his stature
Merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
The flow changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like a lie, paralyzin' the victim
You scream as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Movin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
And injure any motherfuckin' contender


My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats




Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know the deal, nigga
Sha what's good nigga?
Lex Diamond, your big brother here, you know
Let's work this shit out, man
Yeah, yeah, yeah, aiyo, aiyo


Fresh out the jungle where the blue boys run
We carry rugers, smoking toast on your throat like oolas
Hitting reefer, playing my square, windbreaker jacket
Holding my bear, rock and roll in my lear
I have to eat, gun carefully, let the cocaine bling
Strings is nothing, get your ho clapped, king
We hundred burners, onion turners, all this, came out the yard
With twenty five to lifers, loving my squad
You know the gun show off, whips is gleaming, clean as a fuck
In dirty hallways, the ninas'll cluck
This is crime station, my obligation is to look raw as ever
Feed my little sons and patients
Cuz they hungry, shining, bullet fly right through the lining
Catch me on the plane, humble and wining
Feeding me, fresh niggas, downtown, Brooklyn in them brook lands
Is Timbed up, looking for them jookes, with my miss and


Yo, the streets is a part of me
What you witnessing now is don archery
Pack a lambskin hostler, one of these rocks'll soft you over
You ain't nothing, you'se a bitch ass poser
Fiends on your face, on the T-shirt, thinking that you envy the P
Underneath'll be R.I.P
That's what you get, yo, for being so cocky
Two guns, thumbs up, for me and my posse


Yo, what's the science, little nigga? Yo, you beefing too hard
I throw five in your Champ hood, and envy your squad
You try to stick out your fucking hand, nah, I don't want no dap, nigga
Fucking lucky you ain't get glammed
Bitch ass nigga, you wrong, yo, you mingle with rats
The other day you got caught with the gat, nigga
How you home, nigga? Why you even up in my square?
Like you get busy, got the block hot and stare
Fresh coffins fast, they spitting, ya'll fake bitches
Snitches get mad love, hundred and eight stitches
My condolences, word life, if they can find you a real killa
Someone close is singing like the Jonases
Crime Stoppers, the tips keep pouring in
For a G, you be suprised who's going in
Block huggers, the ones who be holding they jock
And suck my cock, the real cock lovers




Ya'll can call me cook up or come back
My flow hot, my hood hot, cuz of one rat
My block on fire cuz of one match
I spit with paper like thumbstacks, these cougars wanna play all these
Young cats
With pussy, turning boys to men, so I resort to the pen
But at the same time, I'm pointing the pen
And now it's game time, nigga, you in? You better thicken your skin
Move with your peoples through the thick and the thin
I watch for po-po, they raiding the crib
And I ain't trying to get jammed, and have the next man raising my kids
God forbid, dudes be hating on his, because a nigga go hard
And hit 'em harder then they saying they is
But that's just New York, I carry the torch, just long enough
To light a Newport and carry this thought
Fuck what you thought, the bigger the boss, bigger the cost
They don't know about the Tribe of Shabazz, niggas is lost






The nigga had a pair of Air Olden Polynice's on
Oh shit, the nigga had a pair of Air Christian Slaters
Rebel I, slay the max, it's really Digital
Rockin' the latest in, every day comin' at niggas
Rockin' the latest in Ben Stillaways
Fuck that, the next big thing, lay this as Hollywood niggas
Now that's a money thing
Yo yo


I was +Dashing+ through the hood
Eighteens with the whip, smoke gray
Leavin' skid marks on five-oh
Smokin' all the way, hahaha!
With my all-star team, bitches see our shine
Yo son we gotta make that +CREAM+ whether raps or nicks and dimes


They call me Rollie, watch me poly with the wide body Dinali
Packed the bad hottie, rocked enough ice to play hockey
I swarm like paparazzi, she popped a wheelie on the candy apple Kawasaki
Everything is sloppy, philosophical for those who copy
I'll probably splash her tonight, don't block me
Sippin' on Lime Bacardi got me toxy
Plus the Cali 'dro holdin' me, I'm 'bout to 'scape like the Roxy
Ever property, Monopoly, big shotti
Snatch the +CREAM+, whether in the concert hall or in the lobby
Used to be a hobby, got me duckin' Rudy Giulianni
Like I'm still coppin' big eights from papi
Follow me, whether Mardi Gras' or house party
It's wild like safari, ain't mean to catch the body
But had 'em wobbly off the first blow, tryin' to knock me
I'm known to pump ya blood like the theme song to Rocky
Kamikaze, might karate chop ya head like a natty dread
Then call myself Collar Ratsi
Professionally trained, I aim for your artery
I give the autographs but charge for photography
Not hardly kid, you awkward Godbody
You'se a carbon copy, just started to rock Wallys
Spark the broccoli, spaz off this ghetto opery
Or catch the hot seat, you're batty bwoy without ya posse
Seen..


Come, come, come
One for the dough, son
Give me the reasons


They couldn't get me, watch me move swiftly
Broke the unmarked fifty with this cabby who was a gypsy
He stayed tipsy, said he loved his bills crispy
Drivin' the streets he kept heat on the night, shifty
Quickly, who ring bells like it's twelve on Sunday?
While the stage catch shells from forceful gunplay
Mere fact that the track was a fierce counterattack
All those who couldn't multiply were sent back
No tanks, low rank, soldiers hittin' the heart
Tainted the heart of an empire, was torn apart
Brought to a halt from a front full assault
The chemist left the lab with undetermined results
They saw the swordsman sift electrical volts
The audience threw nuts with loose screws and bolts
The archives automatically changed ya stiff vibes
It was layin' in the zip drive from chest five




Your faith in Shaolin is courageous
You blind fool we have our teachings to share
Our joy with the people
And there too suffer for them as well
You have learned your style well
Wu-Tang Style




As we return to the 36 Chambers
The RZA, the GZA, the Ol' Dirty BZA
U-God, Chef, the Ghostface Killah
And Meth, Rebel I soldier for the foreclosure
Don't forget about the Masta yo


Motherfuckers halt when my Colt start stomping
Thunder strikes your land with the jolt
Your stamina level is low like currents from
The volts of relentless punishment that multiplies
At a speed that the naked eye can't detect
The infantry, peep the weapontry as I bomb atomically
Stagnant they stood surrounded and astounded
By this total square mileage of violence that I brung
I've not yet begun to stung, it's the ethics
And rigorous training methods of the Abbott
Incite oversees the opposition
Penetrates then infiltrates, breaking down your resistance
Leaving competition defenceless
Masta, Hip Hop antagonizer
Dumb, deaf and blind civilizer with the silencer


Piledriver Tut boulder face blow Hulk
Anger rap book causing chess blade smoke
Monster truck, punk, elephant gun poke
Jawbreaker humanoid vice grip, choke
Face the inferno, maestro pull it
Pipe hard slang, bite the golden bullet
Never, sold my soul Golden Arm cold stinger
See me on the streets address me stone bringer
Ease away, freeze back, feedback, play out in sweet
Action packed rap, bite it, stomp on the beat
Possess hollow head battle teeth Tony Atlas
Wu status now wisdom to the masses


Cock back my tongue like a hammer
My head is like a nickel-plated bammer
Spit .45 caliber grammar
At the speed of wind makes you bleed within
Crack your skull without penetrating your skin
Reign of champ official, Wu stamp with black pistols
Spent the weekend programming fat tracks at Camp Crystal


Home on the range, rebel with a pen
Writing critically acclaimed scriptures that do you in
Mr. Mef, Hot Nickels
Say my shit holding my sex pistol, deal me in


The bewildering Killa Bee quickly sting ya
I ain't gotta lift one fucking finger
Make sure the God Irief turns on the ringer
We ducking the subpoena
Fatal Flying Guillotine machine from Medina


Check the 150 millimeter heater
As it blows holes through your fucking speaker
(Makin you weaker creeping inches centimeters)
{Fifty caliber street sweeper
Shots from Shaolin that go to Massapequa}


Things'll never be the same after this one
Ghostrider spit flame, lay back and twist one
Recognize the Gods came for one accord
One mind and one common cause, that's the shit Son
Play them crows out position, you might hear me
But you don't listen, competition come and get some on
Red marker still bleeding through the paper
Of his sick premeditated murder caper


I walk with the Shaolin strut, burn a dutch
Watch Street eat 'em up, Cold Crush bum rush
Spot rusher get touched, bagged up, handcuffed
Y'all niggas can't fuck with us


Pass me the Black Velvet, embassy suite, killing me
Spell it, Maxi Priest caught me in a daze up on Delancey Street
Stand solar, deadly vengeance with a crowbar
It's like the dreads worshipping Jah, so Aloha
Pineapple crush, 850 swerve it with a rush
Plush the Canola Range spitting off the roof, holding my change
Yo it's ragtime, universal 12 Monkey mind
It's like stalking through your airport with a chunky .9


The underboss Staten New York
Bloodsport gun talk holding fort back, take 'em to court
It's the burner Shaolin bound face down you gets murdered
Roadblock shell shocked, stretched on a back block
Yo it's warfare when you ring here, slugs fly through mid-air
Landing thugs in wheelchairs from the slugfest
Keeps the iron, where the head rest for the conquest subway
Wordplay ricochet through your projects, crime pays
Matched up in a staircase in a dark place embraced
By the trey-eight, I'm in so deep I can't escape
These crime situations, I stay in man formation
A shot echoes through the ghetto locations y'all remain
P.L.O., slam cats like Bam Bam Bigelow
Throw a flow like Nomo, relate like Fidel Castro
I be the great all pro, hanging MCs by they logos
My street journal reacts and blaze like an inferno




At the holy city of Mecca, Grey Flannel cologne
Crazy ammo get blown, wherever I sit, son
That is my throne (Raekwon: you know how we do it)


Aiyo, POP POP POP went the shots, who's to blame?
Three get dropped and removed from the game
One get knocked, now his whole life is changed
Cuz he's so far from free in a world that seem strange


I come from a place where they say, death comes too soon
Where the hoods on the block, dance to a different tune
Every night and every day, hotels of foul play
Turns fatal, when this hostile land of AK's
On any date, not wait to pump them rounds
The reminder; it's a murderer stomping ground
With one less witness, gunned down in the staircase
Who had led his crew, but he was moving at a snail's pace
Many suspects, many possible motives
Just kept coming with unstoppable explosives
The weak fold in these most extreme conditions
While the rivals quickly strengthen their position
The mission was to move in, with sheer brute force
And lives, they get lost, on a collision course
The streets are fascinating, so they gotta explore it more
But not without walking through some hurricane corridors
Become the most wanted, life can seem haunted
Thugs and agents who work closely up on it
Patriotic hustlers that kill for presidents
Conceal the truth, but can't hide the evidence
A man died holding some dice that he was shaking
Like a bank stop, but no valuables was taken
Shot at 8:45, but he died at 9
A video was the most precise witness to the crime




The story had a familiar ring of truth
But it needed, a little more tangible proof
He was blown off the map, behind the aggravated kidnaps
Shrap' metal everywhere, the bomb was gift wrapped
The problem had became increasingly urgent
Since the product was nothing but bags of detergent
In all the years of war, this was the most
Vicious battle and mainly fought from up close
A bundle burglary, with no surprise
Just another sloppy murder that was in disguise
Now they can do nothing but hope and pray
That the boys don't come through with the scope and spray
Valuable time comes with a price to pay
Smoke on a deserted street, just a mile away
Tusslin' with those cannibals, right from the start
That'll rip out your heart, and consume the fattest part
Better watch from the eye of federal agents
Selecting cams, while they was disguised as vagrants
Not knowing that a prisoner had held the key
Of a co-defendant, he was so far from free
Detectives search into a distant past
Of a young gun who made the block grow fast
Narrow ducks who were cooked and came home to roast
The suspects would seek refuge off the coast




Word up, holding it down
Holding the fort, nigga, youknowhatisayin?
All we need is a bunch of red coats coming through
Stayin' official on some gangster shit
Bloodhounds, thirsty, lurking in the bushes
Yeah... (1. b4 Nf6 2. c4)




So yo yo all I want to do is just tell them cats
On the real, keep your game high man, keep it up
Word up, never stop your goals man, yaknowhatI'msayin?
(For real baby)
And, yo son, on the real I'ma get a sneaker just like y'all


I need help (Because the black man is God)
The government is after me (And the worst is, black man is the Devil)
I need help (So this is to bring everything in the)
Someone help me please (universe within the light)
Someone help me! (Understanding)
They already did 2Pac (My children, all six billion humans)
Biggie Smalls (on the planet Earth)
Someone help me! (Regardless of who or what, I love you)
Someone help me please! (Word is bond, I love you)

Ahh! I'mma groupie for life, about nine wife
All the babies are mine, save a child life
No more doctors deliverin my babies
Stick in pins killing me slowly
To the President you say I'm a welfare fraud
You motherfucking right! Let's burn this dark house white!
Insecure about my ding-dong, married to Babylon
My queen lookin at me like a pawn!


Splash the worst rehearse a verse Flashdance on the universe
Televise the work Network Shop till your neck hurt
What up Dirt? Nine diagram phoenix on your sweatshirt
Thirty-thousand went berserk, it's like clockwork
Rockport Mr. Raw God, hold the fort
Collect thoughts, elect sports, sideswipe, by the white horse
French cut, gleaming in the Benz truck, what up?
Telling my mens what? Ten times platinum and we ends up
Draped out, jumpin out a cake, now throw your tape out
Furniture style, holdin the mic we got it laid out
Mind iodine Einstein remind mine
People swam nine didn't know they own kind wrong time
Denim rap, competition quick, handle that
Sucking the jim hat, perverting on my raps'll get you slidapped
Mix drink Cuban Link lizink, flip a to zinc
Plus, expensive like a Roman mink, now think


An ugly thirty-six chamber degree, what, you wanna rhyme?
Deep bring 600 ABC through the love white hate line
I'm telling you tornado, 42 billion thought travel
The year 90's parallel, controls to the wakes
I dick womb and stomach swell, my borough is dark
Many lights UFO kites, Benjamin Franklin got it right
Abraham I stuck your cherry tree
Your white head came out my black pussy
I ran Rip Van Winkle on all fours
Mountains twinkle twinkle star, Tarzan in a jar
And then came out Jane Flintstone in my gravel pit


Kill the chatterin, niggas bust shots, keep em scatterin
Blood splatterin, on point like a javelin
Fuck battlin, you cats is only good for babblin
Imaginin yourself, as the God space travellin
Round the seven rings of Saturn
Got my sword plus the Abbot in the chamber, nine in the clip
At the gatherin, we left you staggerin, yo it had to been
Hot Nickel, who broke bread, at the Vatican
Stick a pin, in a citizen, mental food, got us diggin in
My compliments to the chef
M-E-TH like amphatimens, yes stick it to the veteran
Blaow blaow! Blown to death, take your medicines
I put the sick in your mu-sick with Osirus
Bound to blow like a bad sinus


Stay up at night don't sleep on your morn
Rest in the day because it's sunlight
Reverse thought psychology


Child wild adventures walk trillions of square inches
Ten percentage try to drain me of my mental strengthage
Heavy wattage knowledge cleans blood clottage, and retardage
I refine the garbage logic exterminate your cottage


Thirty-six anger, dirty language is the stranger
The mangler, the honor roll singer righteous finger
When we shine-a, we always find a never minor major
Hard to spot we dangerous with our behavior


Australian Venezuelan illegal aliens
Chameleons all catch the feelings we revealing
Killer bee keep your mind at ease, lay back like Adam fuckin Eve
Four thousand years in the garden, puffin trees


I aim slang I maintain, through the main vein
The answer came clever, when we do greatness through trial and error
Mile of terror motor mouth, let the odour out
Fuming greater, the temper in my spine huminator
The super grass childish blast sleepy eye stash
The hashish masterpiece, Osirus is the virus
This split second splash, severe drop is near pop
There's falling teardrops, now is it worth your career?




I'm in the weed spot, pounds of purp
All the cereal cartoons is on, my favorite shit is the Smurfs
Now I don't slip when I'm down in the dirt
Cause by this time I done seen life and figured the amount that it's worth
It's the first, cops is looking for work
Got my niggas all cuffed up, sweating like a hooker in church
This old woman on her way to the church
She said the neighborhood's fucked up, and we the ones that's making it worse
Now that's fucked up!
I hit the block hard, Timberlands is scuffed up
No justice in the system, look around, it's just us
They tell me only God can judge us
But they ain't ever met Judge Koffler
I'm looking at this cracker on the bench
Don't understand, I only sold crack to pay the rent
Got possession with intent
Player, I ain't stressing, I'm a pimp
My bitches love the cocktail dressing with the shrimp

Hurting the game like the corns that's on your daddy's foot
My niggas carry big guns, y'all niggas carry books
You shook niggas get stripped, beated and wiped out
ConEd status like Fab, nigga it's "Lights Out"
What your life 'bout? Nigga, my life plush
I lost both of my parents, my nigga life sucks
Us Billy Boys hold toys
Cause they don't like us
Raw like the nose on a fiend sniffing that white stuff
Moving with the semi
Eggplant Pennies
Hopping out the Bentley
Looking like I just won an Emmy
Never been a sloucher, dogg cause I'm an alpha-male
Got that product on sale, look at your voucher

Ladies and gentlemen introducing Cab Calloway
Featuring the Dirt Dog
First things first man you're fuckin with the worst
I'll be stickin pins in your head like a fuckin nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with the fat rugged stack
The heat is on, I'm about to blow up the spot
All I wanna see is fire cause I'm makin shit hot
Like the blow between Glocks, mad niggas I shot
Give a fuck on a cop, conversate with a lock
Down at the chop-chop, 600th and Rock
Crazy as a fox tryin to rob Fort Knox
The DeNiro-Al Pachino war
Tryin to score mad dough like a million or more
For the illegal war that's all I saw
It's all about that knot in ya
I'm alone, I roll with 6 niggas with stones
Every hour tap my phone with embezzlement stones
Get a loan from the stocks because of my pops
Fifty bills in the pocks, Wu-Gambino got props


But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale
Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi (Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi)
Hoooooooooooooooooooooo (Hoooooooooooooooooooooo)
He-de-he-de-he-de-he (He-de-he-de-he-de-he)
Heeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyy (Heeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyy)


Elevator scheme with the scheme to catch CREAM
Some diamond rings, jewels all types of priceless things
Just in case you don't make it to the safe
Don't talk to Jakes or your whole shit be laced
Got a bomb bout ready to blow up shit
The White House nuh be quiet as a mouse
My job is hundred proof, better know the scoop
Got niggas undergrounds, in your walls, in your roofs
About made zoo, 6-6-6-6-2
Cause I'm goin all out with the supplies of Balu
I'm unstoppable, my six man team is unstoppable
Stickin my middle fuckin finger at you
Livin in America's fuckin fucked up
When I was young some say I had no sense
I rhymed all day until my throat got tense
And bought em by the cage from my lungs to my knees
In the winter I cough, all summer I sneeze
Ah-choo! Then I was sore, there was only one cure
Original rhymes wholesome in thought
Democratics are debatin wanna be the imitatin
But the knowledge that I'm givin positively stimulatin
I acknowledge any MC in a South Bronx town
South Proof Projects, did they really go down
Shit, I remember when I was 12 years old
I didn't know about frontin or playin a role
I thought I was slick, I fell harder than bricks
With my best lyrics and my uptown ticks
Prince start jackin in my baseball cap
I'm tellin many chit-chats step off my jockstrap
Approach this party other known as a jam
Lookin for my cousin Bam-Bam Sleepingham
]From front to back the jam was packed
Over there some dance, over there I just macked
I looked around then I started to walk
Heard an older woman's voice and a silly slang talk
The kid was nice for payin the price
And give weak MCs beneficial advice
Yes, beneficial meaning good for more
Frontin cause with the mamas would have loved to explore
Studied MC and changed lyrics around
Before I became a member of the lost and sound
My words I strung, I bettered my voice
Rollin over people known to be top choice
Ch-ch - BLAOW BLAOW BLAOW
Hoodlum

Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi (Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi)

She blew in like calm breeze
Tall brown skin her, weave like palm trees
I went coconuts, dip my Dunkin' between your Donut
Don't want it if it ain't no slut, bitch
Fathership touch ground like fly on soup
Don't invite me I tear the fuck down
White boys cut my toupee
Seventh day rester, or screenplay
I slump MC slay, it ain't nothin' to bust ass
Bullet him, get him fast
Bitch I don't break out, blast to the next rash
The dog piss on MCs like trees

That pussy there, couldn't satisfy a hair
On my body, treat me like a lolli and slob me down
(slobbering noises) Doo Doo Brown!
Tossed salad, oh you in some shit now
Callin' me a dog, well leave a dog alone
Cause nothin' can stop me from buryin' my bones
In the backyard of someone else's house
Ol' Dirt Dog, but I'm not dogged out
Here comes Rover, sniffin' at your ass
But pardon me bitch, as I shit on your grass

I'm not the first dog that's shitted on your lawn

Lil' nasty R&B niggas
Yo, you look like, you look like you was break dancin' in alure' video, spinnin' on his lips

What's up wit' bookworm? What's up wit' bookworm?

Nigga, what's up wit' your Speak and Spell shoes?
Fisher Price My First TimberlandsThis shits is old, nigga
You gotta get some Chukkas, fucka
Nigga got on a Lamont Sanford dress shirt
"Whaddaya want, ya big dummy?"

As for me, nigga?


And as for you, you DJ Kat Show shirt wearin' ass nigga
Your shirt look like a dish rag
Nigga, your shirt look like a curtain




Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop


Cash rules everything around me, I'm fresh out the slum
Rich bum nigga, now I live dumb
Talking 'bout that cream
Leaning in the Tower of Pisa
Seven visas, got condos in the jungle
The mind stay rich but the pockets is well-filled
Let's violate this lil' area, get milk
I'm telling you, man, you don't want no part of this, fam
Get punched in the water like clams
KKK, slices, they one of the nicest
Stainless steel, sharp swords, dipped in ricin
Everybody eating, everybody full
Just a young bull lighting a Phillie, still a willy
Ball on 'em, in the Bentley with the wall on 'em
Yo, I'll sleep when I'm dead, like the hood, homies
Who get it cracking in the park, homes?
Park Hill narco, smoke and let the bones turn to charcoal
Let's get richer, kid
Signature Louis Rich, won't stop until there's billions in this bitch


Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop


I grew up on the rhyme side, that "gotta get mine" side
That white girl, we mix it with quinine
You players try and ball from the sidelines
While I'm aging like fine wine, you internet thuggin' somebody timeline
Between love and hate is a fine line
And these habitual line steppers can die trying
A New York Islander, my clique's NY Giants
A pocket full of NY (K)nicks for my clients
Y'all ain't buying, stop crying and stop lying
Hakuna Matata, no Mufasa, I'm not lion
You try to spit on that hot iron, you not iron
The irony 'cause that last shot just shot by him
So let's start it with this, son, motivate him with this one
If you ain't got no haters, go get some
Is anybody greater? There is none
Assorted 'Now And Laters', my clan got too many flavors to pick from


Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop


Deuce high when I start my game
It's like, you should see it live dog, all you see is sparks and flames
I grab bags and I park my ways, the way I have 'em all locked
You would think they gave they heart to bae
Bet on us, baby, ain't no better odds to play
It's hard to fake, my real life is on display
Either love or hate whatever part you play
I take the best of both worlds like R. and Jay
Own boss, no third party
Produce more murder than Irv Gotti
Like I'm working on my third body
Deck, kill it quick
24/7 bed rest, that's how ill it get
Can't stop if I mash the brakes
Got the cash it takes, I might flash my face
Half an eighth got me floating like I'm trapped in space
Not safe for your workplace, a basket case


Don't stop, never stop
Can't stop getting this guap
Fat money knot, hammer cock, curry hot
Cook a fool, hit the block
No shorts, bring it back
Flipping this, stack that
Free it up, weigh it up
Don't stop, never stop
Can't stop getting this guap
Fat money knot, hammer cock, curry hot
Cook a fool, hit the block
No shorts, bring it back
Flipping this, stack that
Free it up, weigh it up
Quest for success with my mind on my money
Came a new rhyme saying "Wu-Tang is the best"
Music
Yeah, peace to Khaled

Dialogue

[Outro: RZA}
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop




Come on my niggas, yo..
Put your guns in your right hand and hold it down towards the floor
Point all your guns down towards the floor for a minute
Yeah, you could hold 'em, just point 'em down towards the floor
For a sec, aight? (Yo y'all ain't fuckin' wit the Wu)
We gon' splash like this, all my wild Digi heads
(Y'all niggas is crook) Y'all niggas move a little up to the front
Y'all niggas know what I'm talkin' about
Word up, my weedheads, y'all play the right for a second
Nahmean? Check it out
All y'all niggas on X, y'all keep y'all asses in the back
Aight? Straight up, in fact, matter of fact
We gon' mingle this shit like mothafuckin' peas in the mothafuckin' pot
Straight up Digi Digi style, word up, as we splash you right
(Yeah, yeah, my niggas is crew, now y'all ain't
Fuckin' wit the Wu
Oh now y'all.. come on!)


Walk wit a diddy bop ock, you silly pop, Jiffy Pop
Fuck around, son, I'll blow ya face up with fifty shots
Sharp darts, and it pop pop like tarts
Extreme speed like Anakin inside the Pod
Headed for the finish line, BOODOO, watch Bobby cross it
Hoes with the diamonds on your toes, come on and floss it
I be one of those tall skinny cats with the four-nine
Three-eleven that rips through Power-U's and breaks spines
I culture power-tuggin' boys who be drunk, buggin'
Lovin' loud noise from toys, club thuggin'
Sweet chocolate deluxe, rugged, sexy buttercup
That don't give a fuck about the cop in the club
Or the bouncer with the flashlight, one walked passed, right?
Some pulled the razor and chopped his ear like he was Mad Mike
I played the cipher in the corner, teachin' math
One for one thoughts, a hundred brothers won't last
"Do U"
Because you can't do me
"Do U"
Because you can't do me
Come on!


Yo, son, Wake Up!
Yo, I gotta do this, man
I gotta get this money, son

Features in the crowd, appearance like, "Black I'm proud"
In the background, no sounds, four pound, we hold ground!
Brooklyn bound, seven initials up in the crown
One man's ramblin', officials they shot him down
Supreme, extreme, lean, killin' machines
All I wanna do is feed my seed, plus my team
Keep it logical, no games, straight up about Prodigal
Diabolic drums and I run from none
Testimony one, give my life before my only son
Thelonious crumbs, why they wanna press me for guns?
Now I'm in the face of the judge, court case thug
From a race, laced, based on drugs, some made slugs
As it was written, stroll through any block forbidden
Glock hidden, why they wanna stop precision?
Eighty-five percent of my brothers locked in prison
And we just keep dyin' for the love of good livin'
But Do U! Do U! Do U!




You know those jams in the park, produced the spark
Made me feel words how I read books in the dark
I always took it to heart, loved the art
A lifetime of darts, ripped crews apart
Made their stay real short, I stamped the passport
Couldn't bring through no wack shit of no sort
I walked the borough challengin' the best that stood
Torch metal mics, they conduct better than wood
Once I electrify and only expect to die
Rounded Bed-Stuy, ZZZZ, nigga fry
My opponent block, the beat comin' from his box
Investment ranker who's a joke in the stocks
Keep a rhythmic pace, maintainin' great balance
Movin' in steps of unheard of silence
Normally progressioners, they're slow steepin'
Niggas wanna light up when there's gas leakin'


"Do U feel?"




Yo, this is a Wu-Banger two thousand and one noise maker
Off the hook guerilla anthem
This is DJ Kay Slay, from around the way
And I'll smack the shit outta ANY OF YOU DJ's
That front on this shit.. think I'm playin?

 (x2)
I heard you ladies got them thangs thangs, do you really?
I heard y'all niggas like to bang bang, do you really?


I never been a fan of the fame, I got love for the game
Never lust for the dames, I got dust in my veins
Little off in the brain, kid talks butter slang
Sniffed a little blow with the rap Eddie Kane
Spent a lot of dough, it's so hard to explain
And I fucked a lot of hoes off the strength of the name
Wu-Tang, see me at the next, X Winter Games
Snowboardin down a ski range, it's a blue and grey frame
Keep, pointin the finger, I'm that nigga to blame
The main reason why you tuck the chain
Self proclaimed, got a lotta profit to gain
And I'm leavin the rap game the same way I came


Now creep with me, as I roll through the Stat
Little Meth got my back, so do Pinky Fat-Fat
Let me hit that {*inhale*} contact, learn how to act
Before you bring that drama the end; now fade to black
Positive, hate kids who tell me lies
Despise guys that wanna get high but never buy
Got nine lives, nine wives that don't listen
Bitchin their biological clocks is tickin
Wu limited edition - hot off the presses
I guess it's, curtains for competition
Method, runnin 'em out, gun in my mouth
The kid your momma warned you about, tear down the house
After midnight, eatin MC's, change to a gremlin
You're tremblin, behind the Kremlin wall, surrenderin
That's what you get for Russian/rushin, in the direction I was bustin
Polish your sword, your shit is rustin

 (x2)
I heard you ladies got them thangs thangs, do you really?
I heard y'all niggas like to bang bang, do you really?


One-two, testin, testin, mic check wreckin
Steps into the session
Automatic weapon off safety, don't play me
But brings all them things with silencers
My clan is liver than your average '85er
Strive to stay alive
I play for keeps in the streets
Cause it's real on the battlefield
Shells hit the ground from the steel
Bullets travel, sun set fire to your mind
Words combine when I rhyme to free the blind
Prepare my queen for battle and walk down
I drink from the wine of violence, no tolerance
Gave word bond, sword silence
Me in military fatigues, bulletproof underneath
Buy enough ammunition to round and sweep the streets
Of Brooklyn, central, sugar-whipped the rental
While I'm lickin out the window at y'all, fuck y'all

 (x2)
I heard you ladies got them thangs thangs, do you really?
I heard y'all niggas like to bang bang, do you really?


Yo, we thrive on street life, we strive to eat right
They blind and need sight, we tried to be nice
They talk the small talk, we walk the long walk
We lost, they all thought, they forced to fall short
We rock for hard rocks, rocked the hot blocks
Shop and cop rocks, watch the top notch in action
Begin to make your head spin
Wu-Tang my brethren, we bang like veterans
They paid for record spins, taste the medicine
Or face the double M, we came to trouble them
Hustle them for they 20 mill' then buckle them
'Nuff to spin out the blue, bitches lovin them
Dozen men with force of a hundred-ten
Stumblin thug passions, it must've been

 (x4)
I heard you ladies got them thangs thangs, do you really?
I heard y'all niggas like to bang bang, do you really?




Aiyo, raise 'em up, hold ya cup
Up, let the Alize fill them up
Thug passion, love passion, niggas, who be actin'
Grey Goose, cranberry juice
Absolut, for those who can't afford the Goose
Malibu, coconut rum, Amaretto sour, coke & rum
We gettin' drunk, Hennessey, V.S.O.P
Age in the barrel, thirty-three years
My girl's been limin' it biz, ya'll niggas sniff lines in the stairs
German beers, Heiniken, Beck's, Bud for you rednecks (yee-hah!)
Milwaukee's best, for those who only got two dollars and a bag of cess


All we wanna do is drink, smoke and fuck (fuck!)


Chronic, blubonic, chocolate Thai stick, you want it
Jamaican green, silver haze, the Northern Lights get ya ass in a daze
Purple hydro, Indonesian skunks, you can tell by the funk
All we need is Fonzo' leaf or a blunt
Ez-Wider, Bamb, I prefer the Dutch
Split the back open, then the weed get crushed
Bic lighter gettin' sparked, we procede to puff




Here's to good friends, tonight is kinda special
The beer we brought, must be something wrong, somehow
Muthafuck the low and brow
Or the Rolling Rock, nigga, cuz I'm sippin' Cristal
Dom P., folski, yeah, Juliet, ice cold P
Peter Pipers, nigga, take a sip
Sit back, muthafucka or I'll bust ya lip




There's Tanya, there's Sandra
Oh shit, there goes my cousin's baby's mamma
Big ass Nicole with no soul
Who would fuck a muthafucka for a jellyroll (jellyroll?)
I see Tasha, Pam and Sasha
Her cousin Tawanna, she's hairy like Chewbacca
Always trynna smoke on that chewbacca
Suck a dick dry for two shots of that Vodka
There's Shasha, BeBe and CeCe
Dede and Deiji, TiTi and FiFi
FayFay and BayBay, KatKat and FayBay
KayKay and Friday, they live for the payday
To drink, smoke and fuck



Fuck! (8X)



Yo, yo, yo, yo Bobby
What up, what up? I can't really hear you
Aiyo, I left ten pounds in the trunk and I gave Sha' ten
Make sure he drops them shits off
I'm on my way back to Mexico to pick up another hundred
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
Yo make the drop off, don't forget man
Yo, I got niggas on the block, block
Niggas with them gats, gats
Niggas on the strip, strip
Puffin' them packs, packs
To my workers that stays sharp like razors
Play my part and blaze it, we braveheart with paper
My niggas got that Dutch, Dutch
Niggas got that black, black
Niggas got a bitch, bitch, head in they lap, lap
My team ain't wit' it, we dreamed and did it
Leaned and pivot, schemed for digits
Everything you seen, we lived it
Nigga front then we get at duke
Dick hard like statues go to hole like Shaq do
I cut you like a cantelope
Like Iverson the truth and the answer
I'm the poison and the antidote
Don't care if the bitch cute, we don't sex raw
We play the corners like the castles on a chess board
Up in the Lex 4, drinkin' a Beck's boy
Shoppin' in the best stores, I'm the nigga to check for
Wanna spend our cheese, smoke all our weed
No tattoo on titties sayin', "F R E"
And my nigga Crizzee baby, and my nigga Digi baby
Wanna spend our cheese, smoke all our weed
No tattoo on titties sayin', "Bob Digi"
Or ShaCrizzee baby, or Lil' Frizzee baby
Bobby, stop
Bobby, the cops is comin'
That shit is tight girl
Hey you
Fuck that mothafucka
You know how I do
Up in the drop-top Boxter headin' the opposite
Direction of the cop inside the chopper
I got the tall Grey Goose vodka
This bitch on my side, with no panties, finger pop her
Ten pounds of skunk up in the front trunk
Bird like hittin' a blunt, about to cum, and I'm pinchin' her cunt
Ninety miles per hour I'm like, "Fuck these punks"
It's the land of the free, son, you only live once
You a smart motherfucker or stupid dunce?
Music blastin', she orgasm like a singer
Sweet, wet pussy got all over my fingers
Now I'm sniffin' my hand, all sippin' the plan
Got the pedal to the floor, goin' swift as I can
Hit the exit, chk-chk-chuh, make the left quick
Hit the garage and slip inside the Lexus
I got many whips, many clips, many chicks
And my dick's been sucked by many lips
Many tips or many Vicks, many sticks
And love to gulp with plenty chips
He got many whips, many clips, many chicks
And his dick's been sucked by many lips
Many tips or many Vicks, many sticks
And love to fuck with plenty chips
Wanna spend our cheese, smoke all our weed
No tattoo on titties, sayin', "F R E"
And my nigga Crizzee baby, and my nigga Digi baby
Wanna spend our cheese, smoke all our weed
No tattoo on titties sayin', "Bob Digi"
Or ShaCrizzee baby, or Lil' Frizzee baby



Homicide city shit
Homicide city shit
Yeah, yeah homicide

You see the neck lit
Fist glisten
Chain dripping
Lane shifting
Riding dirty, dirty
Got that thang
Know I stay grippin
Facing life with it or without it. Bitch it's same difference
Lames drippin
If it's day or night I'mma bang with it
Situation's sicking, nigga's broke and they can't fix it
Dough is all I know, so if you slip it then I can't miss it
Ain't mention Sin and broke niggas in the same sentence
Got the game twisted, mane listen
Say pimpin, what you pushin?
Product pumping like a piston
Hardly getting by
Or probably getting high off what you pitching
While we sitting fly tryin' keep it simplified
Moving like we semper fi
My niggas is born to ride, y'all niggas get sent to die
All you do is mention I, general exemplify
Sin City been gritty, 10-city enterprise
About to make it 25, utilize my witty mind
To improvise my goal to reach the
All-time city high
You don't want the semi flying nine at your hemi fine
All you gotta do is send me time you got plenty time
Mad cause my ones up

And scared cause my guns bust
God's mind is divine, I'll shine on you dumbfucks
Sin never dumb struck
? on the? pumps on any man in the face
And like sanitation dump trucks
Dodge magnum? big enough to slug?
Bubble butts job off of the couch and double dutch
Glock in a double clutch
You don't want no trouble, trust
Rug cutter you're juglar
Promise you your blood'll gush
Dead smack in front of us
Get clap dead you front on us
You back?
You rats feds can't front on us
Stack bread like Wonder
From the winter til the summer come
Upgrade to made
That's when the Benzs and the Hummers come
I ain't want to Hummer stunt
Ask how I stack well
Like Maxwell nigga tryin do a little sumthin, sumthin




My team be bellyaching hungry niggas on the swarm again
Piranha nig bite dick, yo son, it's on again
What up? He made a move, try to assist it
Listen kid yo, you was born to be a pawn but I'm a bishop
Back to the novel, yo Son, it's logical
How you figure God? What? Flow on the track, flip the obstacle
Now my proposal rips the global
From California to courts, it's over God told taste the soul food
Remember baggy jeans, the Timberlands in November
Shorty called me Santa in December
But guess what, my Wally's got messed up
Autograph pressed up what, blessed enough to blow your rest up
We scrape that, Land O' Lake that, Mazola rap
Will get you sent back, represent the gentlemens who bent that
Flash medallions like Italians, la costra nostra
We moving through your hood like we supposed to
Flexing, Lexi Diamonds hold the settlement
To keep the bust your gun boo like that bad ass bitch in Dead Presidents
Ad on the billboard store, check it now, you get the gold dick award
It's like jail and it's the sixth floor
Test me, floating in the S.E., now let's see
Half of y'all niggas built your vine from my stress tree
Faggots, homos, yo, my flavor liver than adobo
Stay militant kid, twist ya like Bolo
You fucking idiot, playing with my Clan but you be fearing it
Fake one, I'm guaranteed to make you take one
Please, y'all niggas money's getting low
But could you come back though, set up shop and get the fat glow?
Tired of y'all, mostly inspired by y'all
So what the deal now, link up with us or put your shield down
Faggot (bitch), you fuck around punk (seven fifteen)
We battle for cream nigga


You want a pound crab? Nah let his hand swing
I ought to punch a hole in his palm with these pointy ass rings
No more said, knew your chump ass was dead
When I saw the .44 reflecting off your shiny forehead
It's Wu-Tang nigga, ain't nothing changed nigga
Still 'Shame on a Nigga', who tried to run game
Your version of perversion, fucking bitches on Persian rugs
Washing niggas like detergent, it's the surgeon
Slugs propels from Bobby Steele's 12 gauge front page "Daily Chronicle" reads
"Hell up in Gotham, take heed and protect your seeds"
You fall like autumn leaves, you lack tranquillity
In your rap utilities to fuck with the abilities
Race like a sperm cell to the ovary
Microphone post tone like a rotary phone, ancient poems of poetry Old scrolls, explosive head bullets, black hooded, Timberland footed ninjas
With 'Full Metal Jacket' clips and know how to put it in you
Surrender your goods and your merchandise for no purchase price, I'm certainly a heist for your ice and curtains and vice
Come quietly, Wu-Tang Clan rules society
Because of variety, so maintain your high anxiety
And lead them to defy me, diary, ya Irie? ...
I need 18 points for my next joint, this high anointed king
To make a deal, I be the one to appoint
Steve Rifkind must have been sniffing
To catch something so dope, it left Monica Lynch pussy dripping
I fuck hundreds of bitches and split millions of dollars
And built with thousands of scholars
My life saga from the hill to the harbor, legal kid brown in Nicaragua
Gave birth to MCs, thieves and bank robbers
We drove expensive whips and took worldwide trips
And my dick's been sucked by the finest lips
Fancy delicatessens and the world's best refreshment
But none of the above compare to the one-twenty lessons
Or my queen and my seeds in the home that I rest in
Enter my zone get blown in 99 sections


This rhyme has no limitation, this time there's no hesitation
Collecting minds at the door
You want it niggas it's yours, the flavors raw
What the fuck you think I'm flowing for? It's rhyme and reason
Bite the bullet, niggas is fowl and it's duck season
We at odds till we even motherfucker
Bad asses, high times, lower classes
Taste mine, straight shots in dirty glasses
Bring it to him, room service, under pressure
And mad nervy, waving guns at the clergy
Ticallion, we ain't worried, keep them sick niggas 7-30
Picture this, watch the birdy
These Bastards is Ol' and Dirty, with sharp hymns
That be stabbing you, pins and needles, needles and pins
'Nough said, dick in your mouth like Tempest Bled'
As I race track with thoroughbreds, ducking the Feds


Yo, my ice look fly upon the keyboard son
Niggas ran up on me lord, praising what we do by the laws
That's right, exile the fake, hit them niggas like weight
Feed 'em food, let the fake evaporate
Reconstruction, that's the whole science on my, production
Y'all niggas guess who stuck son, left his nuts hung
Switch, finger itch, staring at you like a bitch
Maybe y'all niggas snitched
You's a loner, Adidas shell top while I
Sip a Corona, read the Robb Report, then bone her
Buy you some jewels, here's some food
Not necessarily mean to be rude boo, check out the analoo
We in the mushrooms, chased the high neck in the custom
Baggy jeans, thick ropes god, sliding through customs
Chill, y'all niggas know what time it is
James Bond beamers behind me on Bacardi Limon
Check out the pitch like Nolan Ryan, he caught a slug for lying
Yeah you was lying, where's the cash, crying
Militia, rolling in position
Casa Blanca Cuban Link Christian
Lex retali' back whistling fake fucks {*echoes*}



Intro:
Ohh mad one
We see your trap
You can never escape, your fate
Submit with honor to a duel, with my son

I agree
I see you using an old style, I wondered where you had learned it from
You know very well, it's yours too
 Heh, by the Gods, will you show me?
 And where do you come for?
 You come here, since you're so interested
 Fight me



Verse One: The Genius
Yo
Picture bloodbaths and elevator shafts
Like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft
Check the print, it's where veterans spark the letterings
Slow moving MC's is waitin for the editin
The liquid soluble that made up the chemistry
A gaseous element, that burned down your ministry
Herbal vapors, and biblical papers
Smokin Exodus, every square yard is plush
Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions facial expression
Leaves impressions, try to keep a shark nigga guessin
Give crazy shouts Son here's the outcome
Cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss
Shit is outdated, just like neckloads of Sterlings
Suede-fronts, bell-bottoms, and tri-colored Shearlings
I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular homicides
On July 4th in Bed-Stuy
Where money don't grown on trees and there's thievin MC's
Who cut-throat to rake leaves
They can't breathe, blood splash, rushin fast
Like runnin rivers, I be that whiskey in your liver

Chorus: Ol Dirty Bastard
Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!

Verse Two: Master Killer
This is not a eighty-five affair, made clear
When the Gods get on to perform storms blew up
Wu's up, causin the crowd to self-destruct
Killer bees are stingin somethin while I reveal
Science, that's heavily guarded by the culprit
Bombin your barracks, with aerodynamic
Swordplay, poison darts by the doorway
Minds that's laced with explosive doses
Damagin lyrical launcher
Lunge at the youthful offender then injure
Any contender, testin the murderous Master
Could lead to disaster, dynamite thoughts
Explode through your barrier, rips the retina
Who can withstand the astonishing punishing
Stings to the sternum, shocked in the hip-hop livestock
Seekin for a serum, to cure em

Verse Three: Inspector Deck
Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Duckin handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move lioke real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six oh
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Bulding lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, keys in they vaginas
No peace, yo the police mad corrupt
You get bagged up, dependin if you're passin the cut
Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's livin heartless
Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest
Individual, critical thoughts, criminal minded
Blinded by illusion, findin it confusin

Outro: Ol Dirty Bastard
Duel of the iron mics 
It's that fifty-two fatal strikes 
Duel of the iron mics 
It's that fifty-two fatal strikes, NUH 



At the height of their fame and glory, they turned on one another
Each struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy
In the passion and depth of their struggle
They very art, that had raised them through such rapiant heights was lost
Their techniques, vanished





Let's say you say look at someone old like statues
See Buddha, you see laughing Buddha, you see the crying Buddha
You see a sleeping Buddha, you see the tall Buddha
You see the Buddha... you see the female Buddha
You see all these different, variations
These are all different kind of personalities
Or different kind of ways that they have reached the light
You can laugh yourself into the light
You got the drunken Buddha, I mean the drunk monk
Y'knahmean? That's why you can drink yourself into enlightenment
But the side effects of whatever you doin, y'knahmean?
Is gonna determine how long you're gonna enjoy your enlightenment



The vandal, too hot to handle
Cause times is changed and life is strange.
Come to my center, you enter the winter.
What justifies the homicide, when he dies?

It's always the good ones that have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind.
Something in the street went, BANG BANG!
Don't get mad, cause it ain't that bad.

For those that murdered me shall stand before God.
No longer brothers, were unstable
Like Cain when he slew Abel.
Take in my energy, breathe and know the rest,

Cause the good die young and the hard die best.



"Gotta get that, all the way" (3.5X)


Provider of the blow, yo enter the Wu-Tang crew
With verses that curses dudes like Tal Bo
Designed by the mastermind on the mic
(Ohh, We Love You Rakeem) Yea girl aight
Recite to his vidals to idol my title
There's no survival for any rival
Check it check it, my style is perfected
I attack when y'all least it expect it
Corel pounds fouls with the Shaolin style
Puff the White Owls then break wild
Wild wild west, oh yes I suggest
Ya bop to the beat, release all ya stress
I got the proper hip-hop to rock ya
Enter with the Wu-Tang flow, call a doctor
But there's no sickness, only rhyme inflictness
And a slang that seems to be addictive
I got the new rocks, get on Shorty Doo Wop
Love the baracud', come on dance on the block
So go and do your thang and let me du my thang
RZA puts the bang, Enter the Wu-Tang


Can you Wu, Wu-Tang? (MY GOD!)
Can you Wu, Wu-Tang? (MY GOD!)
Can you Wu, Wu-Tang? (MY GOD!)
Can you Wuuu-Tang (MY GOD!)


Those who try to oppose me or even overthrow me
I'm takin more falls than Wile E. Coyote
You can't snag me, rag-tag or bag me
I'd have your ass runnin like Scooby-Doo and Shaggy
Make decisions, to what? 'Catch that pigeon'
But I escape right from your fuckin vision
Blasted, as I mastered you bastards
You tried to be slick like Dastard, Dick Dastard
I got the remedy to kill off my enemies
Carry two guns all my time like Yosemite
Sam, god damn, my style is mad flam
I SLAM! That's the kind of man that I am
The black butterfly, what a guy! What a guy!
Rhymes of harmony like a soft lullabye
So give a SUUUUUU! Real love's gettin Power-U
In ninety-two, Enter the Wu




Yea, the Wu-Tang Clan, somethin new in ninety-two
Comin through with the Fatal Flying Guillotines
So Protect Ya Neck
Power Equality, Allah Cee's Everything
That means peace..

Hahaha
Welcome
Time to shoot back down to the 36 chambers
The 36 chambers of death
Home of Wu-Tang Clan, WTC
I'll tell you this
All my Liquid Sword niggas
All my Cuban Linx niggas
Tical niggas
Those riding through the darkness with us
This is one official right here, I'm telling you that
Keep it 2000 with y'all
Flashnet nigga returns to the guillotine
Poisonous darts, shattering swords nigga
Cutting heads off, strangling
Word of my mother
Yes indeed, yes indeed
So we gon' hold court
Sit back, relax
Light your blunts, niggas
And listen

Once upon a time in Shaolin
The saga continues
Motherfuckers


My Lord don't you worry, I have a good idea
I'll get ahold of the Wu Tang sword manual
I'll get it for you
I don't care how, get that book




People have told me
You have ways of killing without dealing a mob
Well so have I


Yeah, come on, what's the deal?


Yo, pockets is fat like the Good Year blimp
Hollow heads is sterilized in paroxide, waiting for you
Faggot niggas to jump off, your bullshit throne
So I can offer you a tummy tuck
See your stomach is stapled, it's on
It's dangerous down my alley, dog
It's like the halls and I'm outy, dog
Hear the shanks scratching the gate?
See the god Tone standing here for dolo, give you an '89 whooping
Leave your body looking like you was raped
And don't ever come at me sideways, hands in your pocket
Cuz I will turn to Steven Segal, rip your arm out your socket
Ya'll little niggas watch it, I do this for free
Knocking rappers out, trust me, over a clown, I'm not here to make a profit
Nigga, if this was the arts, it be the best kung fu
And I'm Tone Yao Chin, serving ya'll wonton soup
I do shit like disarm a group, drink a 40 with him
And tell ya'll niggas stay the fuck out my loot


My nina, my nine-ah, Medina, marauder
Sabrina, discard her, redeem her, for Allah
Supreme architecture, the beat spark connector
Inject in my serum, infiltrate in your sector


Bobby Steels keep steels concealed, be still
Leave you fifty shot banana clips with free refils
Guns bursting, one person is curtains for certain
Most often fill coffins, no nursing or surgeons
Is needed, bloods depleted, your body deleted
Like unsaved wav files, no way to retrieve it
Best believe it. Tall, slender the cat
I remember that, my moms put gunpowder inside my Similac
My brain untamed,Some claim that son is strange. It's
Cuz in my basement, I keep studios in gun ranges
Plus, I got more Cheese than Sicily
Pizzeria rotisserie, burn MC's out they misery




Aiyo, Ghost, these niggas pussy, mind that take mine
I feel you, form on 'em, yeah, I ain't sharping nothing
I put it in they mouth, I have a nigga kiss the nine
I be mellow, next minute flip, like I just sniffed a line
Ya'll never commited crimes, your rap line forgery
Niggas want war, I invite all cordialy
They assed out morally, how they in skinny jeans
And never fix they mouth to even fucking go to war with me
Oh, that's how you feel, then handle that accordingly
Lay 'em out, bounce before the jake is even on to me
Lay back in the crib, your bitch give me orally
I don't want beef, I'm like Pookie, this is caling me
I ain't with that Twitter shit, nigga try to follow me
Watch you get hit like the Mega Million lottery
I don't got time to be, playing with you faggots
I'mma show you muthafuckas why the call me Havoc, H


So, these killings
When are they gonna come to an end?
Will he ever finish?
Probably the next to see, he must find the Lizard




You just asked me, when will it end?
Hahahahaha, well let me tell you
Once an evil deed is done, then it never ends
It goes on, and it will go on forever...



"Execute them" 


"Slang bang to wax, torture pack, pump it to max
Till your heart collapse, fully auto rap
Might lose your eye sight, blood type, a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype"


Yeah, y'all mothafuckers know, turn my shit up mothafucker
Wild the fuck out, word up fuck the radio
1998 word up, whippin illegal on y'all beagle-lookin mothafuckers
Yo, James spin off, slang dames wanna hit off
Czechoslovak' lock it down, lames get off
Jury match, range rack, fists of fury-act
Don po, six hundred glow, Wally mack poly like that
It's real ("Execute Them"), diabolical
Logical, strange chokehold, kill is possible
Flip a wig blindfold, rewind the scroll
Clip full-mo, flip on the glow, blow
Rock a arm-fold, tourist a bull report
Sit back, calmful, Timberland cold war
Hailin from my next down, rounds clip clowns
Buyin a loyal bitch gowns, go down, fuck them clowns
While we healin, minds, wheelin labs wit cathedral ceilings
Dryer, hitman for hire, alien flyer
"Slang bang to wax, slang bang to wax, slang slang bang to wax
Torture pack"
What what, step up, throw your sword up


Aiyyo witness the abduction, villa destruction
Blood rushin, from a universal standpoint
A lotta shorties bustin, but they gotta cum some
Before they can test my steel
I send a grandson to let em feel one, bodies not worth my gun
PC don, w-w-MastaKill.com, heavily armed
We roam, through the dark damp litter of the forest
Exploerer lives gold, bless em wit a c-note, throw em overboat
Slit his stomach so the body won't float
The vigilant, infinite patient I stand as commanding chief
Mad thorough, competition's intense from every inch of the borough

"Slang bang to wax, torture pack, pump it to the max
Till your heart collapse, fully auto rap" 
"Might lose your eyesight, bloodtype, a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype
(Execute them) I live to write the hype"


Murder verser, twenty beam rap fiend server
Rhymes nurture minds, bustin like twin burners
Certified live, five million eyes left wide
Inside we split the grand prize
Won it by a landslide, dance by the rest
They fit in contest but they pose no threat
Street corner warrior, cause crowd disorder
And glide like rollerblades 'cross your recorders
Soldier of fortune lost in the madness
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Po' bandit hold the belt single-handed
Most Demanded Assassin is what I'm branded
Far from your standard, universally
Planted jewels in the minds of fools left stranded
One man hit force, my shirt ripped off
Squeeze a full clip to kill the bullshit then I dip off

"Slang bang, slang bang to wax (Execute Them)
Torture pack, pump it to the max till your heart collapse
Fully auto rap, might lose your eyesight, bloodtype a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype"
"Execute them" 
"Slang bang to wax, torture pack pump it to max till your heart collapse"
"Sla-slang bang to wax (Execute them)
Torture pack, pump it to the max till your heart collapse (Execute them)
Fully auto rap, might lose your eyesight, bloodtype a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype
I live to write the hype






You stepped in the pit of the flame
You're lost on Beat Street, I'mma throw spit on your name
Hear the roar when they mention the name
It's like Mike when he score with like two seconds left in the game
Small change don't step in my lane
I rock too hardbody, I click-bang, give 'em the pain
Nah man, can't get with them games
Your boy born with it, so how you gon' get him to change
You a lame putting shit in the game
Piranha wanna see me in the state greens and prisoner chains
But I'm smooth like the groove to the listener brain
And you only understand it if you been through my pain
Icy white spitters in frames
Hustle in my blood, bet my seeds gon' get it the same
Yes indeed I'm destined to reign, so ahead of the game
All aboard y'all get on the train


Banana clip Mac-aholic, I slap your cap then join
Go in the freezer, got a skeezer tits out the toilet
Niggas is Norbits, running up on a dice game, call it
Preacher suit on, holding a raw fifth
Put that call in, his dough in the wall, stall him
Plastic bags laying in the floorway, yep
It's just dog's day, reservoir out in Utah, yo
Where my dope and marijuanas got bought in
Real Nikes, afford 'em, we pay to have a roast
Assassins is strapped, this the only way the yay grows
More leverage, more sevens, riding around with legends
Paying judges off, we be up in New York repping


Miramax movie magic, cold beer on tap, rumor has it
Words put ideas on track
Footprints, I walk on Earth and appear on maps
Strive for at least 2.5 mill a year on cap
Wu Wear on my cap, dime piece on the lap
Three hundred push-ups a day put the crease on your back
Be the cap-fitting lieutenant black man
Who invented chopping samples up, to make the beats that's ascended to
Every genre of music, the whole sphere of music
I produced, arranged, engineered the music


My ear candy been dope, my pen stroke like Zorro
Hit the heavy bag like Foreman in the Congo
Mini transmitter, night vision in the stronghold
Rock long robes, smell snakes with a strong nose
Every time the horn blow the Wu signal's back on
Transform, pack form, a whole 'nother platform
We coming back for 'em to smash the spot, kid
I'm on your team too, pass me the rock
Til the casket drop I'mma flip your wig
Rip clothes, honey didn't know my dick this big
You get kicked in the ribs with two chrome gauge
Deadly venom, I send 'em back to stone age




Yo, yeah check it... yo, yo yo yo
Yo, if you think you can  with the Wu Clan
You get ya nose gets swolled up like Toucan
If you think you can  with the Wu Clan
You get ya nose swollen up like Toucan
If you think you can  with the Wu Clan
You get ya nose swollen up like Toucan Sam
And we don't give a damn
Bullets soaked in oil so the Tec can't jam


Sippin on Caribbean rum, coconut juice
Smokin on that chocolate stick
Open up two bottles of that brass monkey on some drunkie 
You R&B fake rappers suck a monkey 
I'm from back in the days, with the Christmas for haze
On my back, striped out black
You like that?; seven braids in my head
My girl stays in the bed and she love to lay the eggs


Prepare for the mic onslaught swift with the sword
Slick Lord, holdin my weight homing abroad
The crowd roared for the peeps playing for the streets
I reeped and sewed, scriptures weeved and woved
Behold gold for the people equal
Fresh on the weekend
Wu-Tang, Biggie Smalls live at the Beacon
Backstage drinks on the house the show was bangin
Brothers Grey Goosin, Wu was Tanqueraying
Allah teaching schools in session, the Gods speakin
I'm just knowledging
Snake handshakes and fake hugs
Waiting for the hour to devour
And splatter ya heads to powder
I'm a slave to the rhythm
But never to a mental deafened power
The hour has come
We got y'all eleven to one son
You done off, too late to break north
Tactics are hazardous to the health, bomb stealth
Rifle stay M-16, know what I mean?
Know what I mean?

A-yo, a-yo, great minds think alike
We used to drink all night
Think about things that's wrong and how to make it right
Ice cold bottles of brass, time flashes
A hundred blunts passes
Before the God asked us
What's the square miles of the planet?
Why is the axis slanted?
How much is covered by water?
How much is granite?
True-I-Master-Equality, God body be
Flowing like the chi energy inside your artery
Faithful as a polished rock against a tank
The force of my will still kill shooting blanks
Just from the sound alone ya heads blown
Still scoring in the red zone you best of head home
Or get thrown to the dead zone, son we need to ill
Interrupt the Grammy show and teach the kids


Yo Just', what we stand for?

What we give for?

I grew up around block parties ready to rock
Behind the rope  with my rhyme on cock
Verse shot first  to pop
The bad weather blew the feathers off a hundred flocks
Seventy-percent goose, thirty duck
Get stuck if each link in your chain is truck
Can't come in this rhyme cypher with nine snipers
Charge off the juice from the pied pipers
Grew up around B-Boys, DJ's, MC's
Through rap, never thinking their ways of TV
It was strictly all about about magnificent rhyme clout
The R.E.C. Room, two dollars with the flyer, three without
Now it's wigs pushed back, name's removed
Off the plaque, too wild to reenact
With tax, that's the price to pay, my goal is to
Aim and spray; my night is the same as day

 (x2)
Yo Just', what we stand for?
What we strive for?
What we live for?
What we give for?

SUCK A DICK!!! 6x

And it don't, it don't, it don't, it don't, it don't, it don't

To burn bush in this rap session, once again
On the run be the Black Stallion

Iron Lung, boy me can done, army of one, blaze yo' bun

Run a mile wit a racist, they iced it, I aced it
Placed it, right up in their face till they faced it
Hard to the dome like a chrome microphone
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bad to the bone to the bone
Danger zone, that's my life and my song
Keep it movin, hop along little doggies!


Uh uh uh, FUCK YOU!!!
Drive The Mack Cadillac
Dark shade the window all sunny and black
Pitch antenna back of the car
Inside is a TV, even a bar
Bulletproof down, safe and sound
Chauffeur in the FRONT just to drive the Lexus all around
Give ya, give ya, give ya body a ride, nice and warm inside
Come to the Dirt Dog as the tummy rise
*Laughs* Enter


Yo yo my Wu-Tang cliff'll make your atom split
The power of my brain, you can't fathom it
Whoever go against the will of the grain will get slain
Don't EVER say thy God name in vain
My third eye electronic dragonfly spiral observe
Can record your words
And your lies and approach you
And have my Dogs come and Ghost you
When it comes to the bread son, the heat will toast you


Music makes me lose control
This is not just rock and roll
Hip hop digs right to the soul
Music makes me lose control
Wu-Tang, now we on a roll
On a rise, now here we go
Guaranteed to flip the show
RZA beats is outta control
Outta control, outta control, outta control
Outta control, now here we go


Yo who got that nigga gassed like he can't get skimasked
Abducted from his doorstep
Dufflebag his head for the price of nothin
He's a glutton
What I'm manifestin each day is a lesson
Ya'll faggots, came to the School of the 36 Chambers
Copied on papers of scholars that earn dollars
We trendsetters in Wu leathers, trendsetters in Wu leathers, whatever

Chorus  2x
Music makes me lose control
This is not just rock and roll
Hip hop digs right to the soul
Music makes me lose control
Wu-Tang, now we on a roll
On a rise, now here we go *Skip next line on the second time of chorus*
Music makes me lose control (2x)

Guaranteed to rip the show
RZA beats is outta control
Outta control, outta control, outta control
Now here we go



"Don't pursue him
It would be dangerous
Because that might force him to kill you
And he would not hesitate to do that."
"May I know your name?"
"You two men, I assume are new pupils of the temple."
"Yes!"
"Hmm, I am Hee Mai."
"Pejah."
"I was ordered by your reputed abbot
To enter into retreat here
It seems destiny has so arranged things
That we meet here
Now tell me what particular styles
Of kung-fu you are learning here."
"I am learning boxing."
"Hmm. Well I'll teach you boxing
And also how to use the whip
However, in return for this though
You must do something for me."
"Could you tell us what you'd like us to do?"
"I have two serious female disciples
One is Mau Tru Wah, and the other is Win Len Jong
My husband died. He was killed some time ago
In a battle with the Wu-Tang."




Feelings. The emotional side of a man, woman or a child's character. A response or tendency to respond. A belief, which can be vague, illogical, but mostly, irrational


I never gave a fuck on how the next nigga felt
I rocked a heavyweight belt cause that's the way I felt
Still feel, so inspired to write a rhyme that's ultimately
No other emcee could get with me, is way I felt
Don't forget the first time you heard me rhyme the way
The first time you heard "Protect Ya Neck", the way you felt
Like no other hip hop record ever made you felt
Cards dealt, played my handle, when no matter how I felt


Every time we touch the mic, you know our lyrics is felt
Worldwide, live, polaroid shit, all my homies is
And we ride out to all of our music is
Yeah, we gets busy, teach the youth  because we know how it felt
Give em Knowledge of self expressing in a way that it's felt
So each and every person to recognize what they felt
Watch your mind state because the evil could be felt
You never know, how when I first came out, how my brothers felt
I've been going through it, plus a lot of deep pain was felt
We would last for a night, but a better tomorrow


I felt the angel of death breathe
When I felt the four fifths something told me squeeze
I felt like it was the end of a dynasty
Like I was fighting a clique of five Chinese thieves
Karate slippers with slip on's so I kept slippin'
The floor was too smooth felt like I couldn't catch a grip in
Felt like Dragonfly Jones, was Dragonfly Tone
So I kept spitting, woke up when I heard the phone


I never gave a what on how the next rapper felt
I take that rapper's belt myself, I feel how Cappa felt
I don't really need help, use a sharpie, don't need the felt
Marker, walk on water, I see how Jesus felt
No rhyme or reason, just bleeding, my every breathing's felt
This about a thesis that even paraplegics felt
These boys ain't needing, they barely breathing, believe it, seen it
Till you got cheated, you couldn't tell me how cheating felt
I'm not a failure, I couldn't tell ya how losing felt
Might not have nailed her, but I can tell ya how spooning felt
Remember when you first heard the rap and the way it felt
I burned the track with a murder rap and I know it's felt






These are the men who lead the crime families of America
I control 26,000 men
Except for dope, we operate in all aspects of organized crime. And if there's one thing I'm sure of
It's that drugs destroy your mind and destroy your home
In the end it'll only lead our country into ruin


We eat fish, toss salads and make rap ballads
The biochemical slanglord'll throw the Arabs
In the dope fiend, vocal chords switch laser beams
My triple sevens broke the slot machines out in Queens
Grey Poupon is Revlon rap, smack pawns, swing like batons
Most my niggas smoke like Hillshire Farms
Check the gummy sole, underneath my shoe lies the tap
That attract bow-legged bitches with wide horse gaps
In steel mills Iron he'll smoke the blow on duns
You run errands, Primatene Mist is afraid of my lungs
Turn my channel, it'll blow your whole bench off the panel
Like eighty roman candles that backfired then slammed you
Every day is like a video shoot, check this shit
I take it back to Playboy, stash guns in whips
Picture afro picks, shish kabobs and dashikis
Thousands civil marched, raised their fists in early sixties


Now check this one, you must have been stupid to miss this one
Donna shogun-ing flip a ton of fashion
Destination be the cash one, I step past one
Don't make me blast one, I'm cold like Eskimo floe
Cappa villain stay chilling take shots of penicillin
Clean out and let the steam out, she fiend to blow out
But I'm equipped with mad white, Morris The Rap got nine lives
I'll take a few hundred thousand dollar dives
And then I still never go down
Until the last round I shine
When RZA do his thing motherfucker, I'mma do mine


Now, where I come from cats be carrying, marrying drug money
Fuck up your wife, get four to life
Cream we handling, Midtown niggas scrambling
Move and examine the fly shit, plus quick to buy shit
Chef, yeah, you know the whole gods astral
Fidel Castro suits plus depositing cash rule
Big time, play it like Canadian wine
RZA's divine now, the sacredness of one's true mind
Now let's get colorful like money green
High roller coaster, Sosa, million dollar nigga roaster
Yeah God, be having my whole steez laced
Now let's rap a taste, connect dots, aim Glocks, train stop
Figaro fly jeweling, tri-color Cubans
Swerving with power Germans and Suburbans
Twenty-four niggas with vests on, my own restaurant
Dons sending my sons membership forms
And still getting this paper scraper
Fake gators from Jamaica, wizzes be passing like Lakers
And it be coming from Lex Louis Rich Liberace
Fetus style and blocking goals like hockey






Yo, (Wu) one two (Tang) one two (Wu-Tang)
It's the Wu (Wu-Tang) creepin in the shadows (Wu-Tang)

Yeah

My rap style swing like Willie Mays
My eyes Purple Haze, my solar razor burn through shades
Rhyme grenades raid the airwaves, catch this rap page
I glide like, hovercrafts on the Everglades
Born master, with the faster blade, track slasher
Manufacture poems to microphones, bones fracture
Limited edition composition spark friction
Non-fiction, the calm bomb, keep your arms distance
Zero tolerance, dominant intelligence
Wu original, true colors step from the melanin
The most high, most try, to get close by
And overthrow I, but choke, with they hopes up high
I circulate the tri-state and vibrate beyond the Richter
Fly sistas flock when they spot this live nigga
The crowd seducer black your third eye before I lose ya
Verbal high, leave styes in the eyes of Medusa
Top ten, poly like Cochran, and Sharpton
Narrow margin, of your odds to dodge the marksman
Murder rap, kill you soft like Roberta Flack
Words attack like a British Bulldog, observe the stacks

(Oh baby, for heavens sake)

Now all pay tribute to this entity
A spark that surges through the undergrowth
Overwhelming the populace from the entry
The Wu-Tang Dynasty, has emerged
From this elite fleet I was appointed to strike the vital nerve
Mouths tend to utter and speak empty words
Observe the magnetic attraction as we breathe
Seeds of MC's at these fake ass industry niggas
Feed off, the chrome mic tend to squeeze off
And spray, an array of shots
That travel downwind, just respect my prolific pen
As I send, the minds of the weak
To rise and take power I blew tower-ing over the land
As we stand, expanding our cream
A dollar to every grain of sand
Let the mind use the physical as planned

(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)



Yo, yo, this is Beirut
Try to comprehend check out my new suit
Gods blend aim take fire pure destruction
Disappear from here, my year, drop the stupid LP's everywhere
Fallin out the sky tall sniper
Raps by Cappadonna hit the countryside
Poetry whirlpool, RZA and True collide
We produce article exception to the rule
We the black men that struck oil, the hardboiled
Cats that made that Watergate thing go spoiled
The heavy-handed, locked down stranded with Cyrus
Wu Pirates, sneak inside the club, low eyes
Low down dirty, twelve thirty, night time crawlers
Off-the-wallers, basketball gun brawlers
Smoked out throw both fists for nine-seven
Slang reverend, put the best work in

You think I'm kinda crazy, but I gotta few regrets
Livin like a king, with a pocket full of grits
We come from different worlds, don't you ever forget

I'm your highness, your highest title, numero uno
Putos, they clone  like Naruto
Your man super, grand groover on that Sambuca
Mass mover, automatic rap Ruger
Clap back, I bleed for my brother
You know, the wolves stay fed cause they feed on each other
I got a G for a mother
Cynthia's son, take the game like three at the buzzer
Harder than the prison wall, hitting y'all all
Up in critical condition it's official when my clique involved
Listen y'all, Sir I certified
Anything other than the facts are falsified
They idolize I, well i know wise guys, leave em eyes wide
Inside the gravel pit, spitting cyanide
Darts flash, hot enough to warp glass
When the shark pass, piranhas park 


I'm kinda swole, cause everything I want I got made
I never feared, got everything from choppers to blades
They gave me rags and all of them they knew I want haze
When I was spliffing that night, me and the  with K's
Some kids across town thought I was amazed
Knew I was fronting, I had the army in range
It's most of us popping pains, selling drugs in the rain
Trynna make money, maintain and build me a train
Deal with facts only, no slang, that's only for dames
We will run up in the building tags and niggas with chains
Rocking range, lock and aim, take your sneakers and chain
Leave em snubbed, outta luck, you shoulda bought you your flames
But you didn't, this could happen to a king or a queen
Be on point next time and don't be bringing no lames
Cause if you fuck up the next time it might make you famous
Might bump into a gunman who only want brains and shit


I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
I get the cash, see money over tricks and
But keep a snow bunny in the kitchen
The hood still love cause I'm different, see that's the difference
I talk greasy, my hands greasy, that's the chicken
It's that easy, my flow phat cause I'm that greedy
You got to feed me in stacks, what up to Crakk Peedi
State property, racially profiled
State trooper stopping me, I'm low down
Dirty it's a shame, I should slow down
Kick off my shoes, put my coat down
Separate the oil from the coke now
Pennies I got plenty and I still want more
Kinda like a Beamer '35 I still want four
85% still don't know
That is a hundred percent and y'all rappers tryna steal my flow


I got a name from everything from con to Sway
I got my row stitched up by a Colombian name
I got a crack spot, a G5 I never flown
I got a shark, a dog with a solid gold bone
I even copped me a piece of mind up in the Buddhist mountains
I don't sweat money, I got ten accountants
With fly bitches butt naked in Bermuda
And buddha, ice cooler, Grey Goose and big Ruger
The fact is, I pose for low in Gazelle glasses
The booth Ted Dibiase just tripled the carats
And you can tell by the style I choose
I'm creatively superior, I rhyme over the blues
Never lose, never lost,  of the frost
I got a whole clan and Tonetana's the boss
I get paid when my record is played
To put it short: I got it made




Get it!
Haha, Funk Doc in the building, bitch
Ya'll already know the business, nigga, haha


Yo, let's get it, yeah, I'm with it
Streets on fire, I'm frying my dinner
Quick like Sugar Ray Leonard, one love
Any boy get served like tennis
Menace, you call a rap bulldog
Me and my pen form into Voltron
Cold, my heart built with a snowball
And I fuck old women like Zohan
Roll on like Mitchum
Barry Bonds this bitch when the beat start pitching
I'm broke, my ATM ain't kicking
But what I drive, I build expensive
Look at me, nigga, I got it
In pocket, ask Houston how I 'rock-it'
If I go hungry, you getting robbed
By me, Biggie Smalls and The Delfonics


Yo, man, yeah, yeah, take it back to Rae shit
Straight off the muthafucking concrete, nigga
You know how I go, word up, let's go
{Three minutes left...}


Before all the cussing and the gunfights
Don't wanna run Nikes, yeah, scramble when it sunlight
G's in my pocket of juice, blue goose
I'm a goon under the moon, glow on the boosters
Yeah, deadily my sons regret me
Windpipe writing, the mic fighting, respect me
I'm from where it get down, machete your mother
Snatch your brother, scrap you down
You know the deal, when we do this, chill
Catch me in Brazil, ratchet on, little glass of Tequil'
I sware to the real, my real, if I don't win
Then I won't spend, I'm grabbing bill
That's the hammer, I'mma do this, nana
Niggas who hunt, snatch 'em up, bite the clip, the banana
And this is for them good niggas, blow that L
And that blow that well, and watch the book, niggas


Yeah, watch them jooks, niggas, you know what it be, man
Word up, niggas staying alive (Gotta kill these voices in my head)
{Two minutes left} Bunch of fucking roaches, man


Jeter, married to the game without a pre-nub
And she don't act up, if I don't eat her
Damn, now that's what I call a diva
You sick, man? I'm what you call a fever
And I don't put no snow up in my cheeba
Pack a little heater, the game get colder in the freezer
Hit your little corner with the sweeper
Dance with the reaper, sharper than a fuck
Plus I'm laying in the cut like a half-moon Caeser
What you getting is the truth
My bird eye visions spot the pigeon in the coup
Same way I live it, how I spit it in the booth
Next to RZA, ain't no nigga bigger than the group
Stat, fuck that, we come strapped
Bust gats, drug raps, and pump cracks
What you trying do nigga, we done done that
I'm off the gunrack, nigga put ya gun back


Yeah, you slow your blow, boy
You gon' lay where you lie, nigga
(Get rid of the crack, and flush that dust
Hurry, where the L, move, come on, freeze, freeze)
{One minute left}


Aiyo, I woke up in handcuffs, heard the police wanted me dead
Big bullets and splashing all over
Kingpin's still moving that weight
And his main goon burned up a discotech
He's a hazard, classic, nigga, we got a flick of him
He jacked Nate, while he took the picture
And we tapped his crib, bugs all in the jacuzzi
Under the seeds bed, we found an uzi
Trully, and we know about his bitch in Charlotte
Pulled her over, State Troopers found two revolvers
And she told us them handguns "That's my fathers
And I'm licensed to carry those shits regardless
Ya'll just played my man, caught her with a million dollars
Worth of fireworks, coming back from Japan
It's nothing, ya'll police be fronting
And stop looking at my pussy, like ya'll want to suck it, I'm out
On ya'll pussies, catch me next time, bye bye"


Alright, fellas stand back and watch the closing doors
Lock 'em up! Let's go, lights out



Yeah, yeah yeah now, what the fuck now?
Flipmode Wu-Tang shit, what the fuck now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Historical and monumental shit
What the fuck now? Yeah, yeah, yeah
Straight smack a nigga right in the face like this was handball
Or make a mural out his face up on a damn wall
Niggas play hard and shit
If you know what's best for you y'all niggas better safeguard your shit
Even though we rep brass knuckle rap
Fuck with street geniuses and bowlegged chicks who walk with a gap
Street niggas now the corporate boss
Still go to y'all restaurant for steamed fish and Irish moss
And y-yo, the way we do it and you see how my shit bomb
Your whole show wack and I'm a cancel your sitcom
Fuck a nigga broad 'til she tired and real calm
You ain't knowin' my name tattooed on your bitch arm
The way we blow shit is a shame
Casually bust my gun and celebrate bustin' a cork on the champagne
Wrote you with a whole new approach that lead a whole team of niggas
Y'all should know I only ball like a coach, now!
Check out the light fixture, freak lines like white bitches
Let the mic lines hang, that slang is ridiculous
Emperor of warlords, big gun only fuck with sawed offs
That's my specialty, more to bust
Shot out my bed parrot keep it gangster Lord
I analyze your work those that got merked were not established
Texture look classy, arm baby 2000 Raspberry
S-5, blowin through Asbury
Soon to own steakhouses, glowin' like makeover thousand
Them them niggas, robbin' from Pinkhouse's
Show and prove, knockin' off cab drivers
God, sodomize money, ring two hundred thousand
See the color of the carved out Wu emblem
Baby, it's all designers, tailor-made Wu gooses
Limousine, automatic new Uzi's in 'em yo
Relax, cousin just cruise through, jewels with him
Move up the block, giant box blast my song
Non-stop, strictly hip-hop, march on
Doo rag hang long, metal tape is high bias
Graphics, captured with the colorful iris
I zoom in while the listeners tune in
Some assumin' they paid dues and joined the union
Lost nigga couldn't rumble in this wild jungle
Quick to crumble, type to be on the stand and fumble
Divine Master threw on the track that made 'em bleed
He produce at unattainable rains of top speed
This powerful magnet that left 'em stagnant
Was unlikely in cameras in larger fragments
Unfilled rifle, scout sniper, shots precise
Starlight scope with the night vision device
Splendid marksman that'll shoot the one off the dice
Split a grain of rice in one shot we kill 'em twice



(*Prod. by The Revelations, Bob Perry, Noah Rubin)


The body is a vehicle for the mind
You realize that your body, is basically vacumnin that space
Into somethin from within this body
This is why the air must come in, every breath
Look at - I say look at ODB, okay
A free man for real, knahmsayin?
His his expression of freedom, his what he wanted to do
It was VERY free, one out of a million people
Could deter him, from an idea, y'knahmean?
Cause he was free to express like that, y'knahmean?




If you got it, light it up (8X)


Ain't no shook in 'em, Pyrex pots is hot, fiends is cooking 'em
Little niggas hugging the block, cops is booking 'em
Women hugging they purse when they spot the crook in 'em
Back when little J got shot, pops was whooping 'em
Little noses dripping with snot, ock, now look at 'em
The ghetto got a hook in 'em now, drugs, stay pushing 'em
Used to throwing dirt in these blunts, now, it's kush in 'em
Used to tell these chicks to shut up, now, he's shooshing 'em
Get cash, get that ass or put a foot in 'em
Iron Flag, flag that cab, Bedford and Put-e-nam
There ain't no puss in 'em, dick, dildo, or gush in 'em
Niggas still got that juks in 'em

 + (Raekwon)
If he front then we stomp 'em out (Get 'em out ya way pa)
If he drunk and he run his mouth (Get 'em out ya way pa)
If he front then we stomp 'em out (Get 'em out ya way pa)
(Get 'em out ya way pa, move, move, move)


I'm seduced by the chrome, it's a ruthless poem
It took a little time to get his juices going
Producers know him as the kid with the Iron Palm
Righteous hammer examine the firearm
Approach or get fired on, permanent chest scar
Empire Strikes Back, check out the Death Star
Bless y'all, wet y'all, do the impossible
Where I'm from we use dum-dums in the arsenal
Highly sparkable, get stretched off the knuckle check
Known to scuffle, I take it to the upper deck
Universal conquest, kung fu buckle vets
In a dufflebag, max yo, a couple techs
Give 'em ear hustle, Wu brand we programmed
Next time we dance, it won't be a slow jam
I fear no man, son you get lynched up
Nigga bitch get Frankenstein stitched up




Yeah, voice skipping off percussion
Give it to 'em how they love it, slow flow, deadly, beloved
All praise the daunting calm yet
So alarming, without a word being spoken
A thought with no voice, just a nod and a look
The contract was took, straight cash, off the books
A major pawn took a Don, look, he's armed
With a few black rooks from the heart of the Crook
Shook ones look while they hung him on Hercules hooks
They found his body near a shallow brook, escaped on foot
Switched the look up, out of state, he got the hook up
The flipped cake, thought lighter than the feather
Yet heavier than weight when my mindstate starts to break
Take cover over RZA instrumental
I'm damn near invincible, it's simple




Tell me, what are they like?
They got holes in the top, five round holes
While I was watching, this stranger, hit them
But his fingers went right through the bone
So then, they've... mastered it
It's some style of kung fu, you know it?
The Skeleton Claw






I don't know how you all see it, but when it comes to the children, Wu-Tang is for the children. We teach the children. You know what I mean? Puffy is good, but Wu-Tang is the best


Monster cut truck balley shit
Champagne spilling while we hitting every bump that my Denali hit
Outfit is four thousand and better
The rhinestones in my flintstones look crazy in my sweater
Pah, it's not a big fairy tale that's my M.O
Fuck bitches on the reg' with no problemo
Iceberg, rabbits, in the Foxhills Mall
Where I coped two more, brought four for RZA
Bad Boy thank you for this special delivery
Catch me by the pool in my Tony Starks slippers
Wonder Woman armed, Ghost is intelligent
Made 30 off of dust dime I was killin 'em
Did cash on One-Sixteen I was feelin 'em
Them days kept a crisp coke dollar bill on 'em
I lived it out -- special delivery
I spit it out -- special delivery
I lived it out -- special delivery
I spit it out -- special delivery


I want that
I need that
I want that
Come give it to me


My eyes is sore, being a senator
Behind closed doors hitting truth to the seafloor
The rich go North, ignore the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'mma reveal everything, change the law
I find myself walking the streets
Trying to find what's really going on in the streets


Feel the heat from the streets, I got to eat
Talk what I walk, I stalk with bronze feet
Ancient spells, yell durag sheet
Jump on the jamb with 36 peak
Beat up the beat, overload rap treat mix
Cape in the wind like the John Woo flicks
Now, take the spirit, crash more clearer
The sweat of the body covers the man in the mirror


I want that
I need that
I want that
Come give it to me


OK? I want you all to know that this is ODB and I love you all. Peace!

I'm confused now




Yeah, yo son you gotta take me to get them Clarks, man
Yo, check it out, yo
Yo, I got a new, yooo! Niggas don't even know son
Yo check the joint, boom
Yo I got a crazy idea how to do Clarks now
Check it out, boom, this is how you freak 'em, boom
You go get you go get the cream joints right? Boom
Now now, all you all you dye, is this shit right here, boom
And this, you know what I'm saying? Any color you want
But it'd be like, blue and cream, you know what I'm saying?
Shit like that, niggas don't even know
But son word is bond I'ma rock niggas this summer
On the real, know what I'm saying?
Yo son, I had crazy visions
Check it out check it out check it out, boom
Just imagine if you buy, woo! Check it out
Just imagine you bought navy blue, right
A navy blue, a navy blue pair right, boom
Of this, of this shit, know what I'm saying?
But dyed get this dyed cream on top
Just imagine that color like
But you got it dripping like it's marble cake like...


Stand on the block, Reebok, gun cocked
Avalanche rock get paid off mass murderous services
Chef break 'em, watch the alley cats bake 'em
Four-nine made 'em, drop grenades and take 'em
Quick fast we reflect like the sky be blue true
Wu-Tang saga continue
Rap Meyer Lansky crash your fantasy
Getting high fellas stand by, here's the plan, see
Sit back collecting Tecs and cheques and
Blowing slow in a Montero flexing
Beats break heavily word to INS bless me
Throw me like three bags of cess
For real from the Killah Hill locked and caged in
We're sworn representatives, we acting like made men
Strive for wives, nine lives and lies
Max, sell and enjoy the highs, what?


The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Baker baker, pull off a keystone kaper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and watch me scrape her


Proceed with caution as you enter the symphony
Degrees of punishment increase intensely
Syndrome was caused by the deadly drums
But the battle was won by swords being swung
Slicing with a vocal, from the international vocalist
Your style is too local to fuck with this
Offensive antagonist
No assistance, moving motionless
Mysterious swiftness
Thoughts roll down the shaft of the brain
Mental gives the signal to the physical
Whirlwind kicks and hits from every angle
Violent temperaments left continents dented
Poison vintage wine rhymes I invented
Drunk by the drunken puncheons that punctures the heart
Vital sparks from the arteries stopped


The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Baker baker, pull off a keystone kaper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and watch me scrape her


Straight up and down it's all good
Peace to them cheque cashing, chain snatching, gun flashing
Niggas in the hoods bubbling good
Analyze Starks, who be buying lion heads and Clarks
To all my house bitches, Starks'll be home soon
I'm on tour chill, catch me '96 in June
But until then my ten-man team be safe
Chill on the whips for seven months, we can all get laced
Take a boat cruise, sip daiquiris and max
Swimming pools, fly jewels, Wally shoes, blow stacks
Relax kids, black kids got a craving for Cris
Until we get back, unpack, leave the Mac with your Wis'
But whatever, I gotta hit other sides of the Earth
Spread Wu-ness, rule this, civilization's cursed
But luckily I'm born to be wild and then be out
Move crowds collect twenty thou and then be out
Heavy convoys my crew keep pretty boys paranoid
Built like a steroid pat down Dan Aykroyd
My seeds, grow with his seeds, marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family


The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Baker baker, pull off a keystone kaper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and watch me scrape her


My seeds, run with his seeds, marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family



It's been a long time since the father left in '69
It's been a long time since Wu Tang had the chance to shine
It's been a long time since we had diamonds, gold and drink Cristal wine
It's been a long time of walking around here dumb, deaf, and blind
It's been a long time since you had the Son of Man chant like golden wine
It's been a long time...




Digital Electronics!


So we gon' check the 25th caller

You stomp the fuck off yo' block

Bob Digi-tech live in effect, you just didn't expect
One man to come along and bring a new song
And break your barrier down, you can't carry the sound
Buckwild juvenile from Shaolin Island, what? What?
Who wants to get violent? Remain silent

My Glocko pop pop pop
My Glocko pop pop pop
His Glocko pop pop pop
His Glocko pop pop pop
My son go pop pop pop

His Glocko pop pop pop
One love, go pop pop pop

Yo.. who wanna play the hero? Your chances are slim
Less than zero, Shaolin laboratory friend
That's the shit though, came to satisfy but can't get no
Sound pasified from the get-go, Cuban neckties for you Kiko
Only carry mines for protection, the hoods like the Wild West I reckon
Hold up a second, lost my breathe and
Take it from the top Introducin'! (Mr. Method)
Runnin in your session
With nothin but my words as my weapon
And twenty-eight years of aggression
Do it for my people when I take it back
Like I'm repo-man, agent double-oh negro
Know who I am? No, I don't give a damn
Evil, flash a Crooked I like I'm Deebo
Gets down and dirty like your moms pots and pans
From a small town, drink ya down like Shazaam!
This is how ya Enter the Wu-Tang Clan (Yeah)
36 Chambers, you're pu-tang man (Word)
Brothers with a mic make a true slang fan(Yeah)
Brother with a gun make the loot change hands (Word)
That's how it is, you could ask RZ-A
Through rain, hail or snow I deliver


DJ, that music just turns me on


The marvelous bone crushin assassin appears to be
Blind in glasses
Daredevil bang head with shovel
Iron skin, Tony Starks, liquid metal
The rebel in the evenin, shadows sweapens, vanishin
The book of instruction, fuckin with the Wu-Tang Production
Is lord to all who come and see, my art too deadly to teach
Read my death touch, ascended grief between each point
Slendid, hand Swingin Sword recommended
Slice through the bone intended
Try to sketch the classes, reflection of perfection
Mic-phone swing like numb stick to scar
Mohammed Ali, mic MC, Shakwan walk the dead sea
Dead sea, Digi..


Yo, yo.. yo..
My mind keeps playin tricks, I'm caught up in The Matrix
Digital mode, your flows is all wasted
You smoke weed with seeds, I crush mines and lace it
Two tokes a pass, kid it's all basic
I know you lust, so relax and be patient
As soon as I spark the stem, ya all taste it
Number one on the charts, it's time to erase it
Replace it, you was wack from the start, face it


DJ, that music just turns me on


My Glocko pop pop pop
His love go pop pop pop
My Glocko pop pop pop (x5)
You stomp the fuck off yo' block
My Glocko pop pop pop
His Glocko pop pop..


DJ, that music just turns me on



In progress...




1,2, 1,2, yo check this out, it's the jump off right now
I want everybody, to put your work down, put your guns down
And report to the pit, the gravel pit
Leave your problems at home, leave your children at home
We gon' take it back underground, I be Bobby Boulders
Wu-Tang Clan on yo' mind one time
It's the jump off, so just jump off my nigga


Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it


Ha, holocaust from the land of the lost
Behold the pale horse, off course (off course)
Follow me, Wu-Tang gotta be
The best thing since Starks and Clark Wallabees
African killer bees blackwatch
On your radio, blowin out yo' watts
From Park Hill, the house on haunted hill
Every time you walk by your back get a chill
Let's peel, who want to talk rap skills
I spit like a semi-automatic to the grill
Elbow grease, and elbow room
Baby play me, baby fall down, go boom
Party people gather round, count down to apocalypse
(I'm the kid with the golden arms)
And I'm the motherfuckin hott nikks pass the blunt
My nigga don't front
You had it for a minute but it seem like a month
Now I'm chokin, smokin, hopin
I don't croakin, from overdosin
Hey, kid, walk straight, master your high
Wu and Meth got you open (open), let's ride
Can't stand niggas that floss too much
Can't stand Bentleys they cost too much
Kid wanna get up then kid get touched
Kid wanna stick up then kid get stuck
I'm the one that called your bluff
When your boy tried to act tough
Remember what Ol' Dirty said: "I'll fuck yo' ass up!"
Now listen


Back, back and forth and forth


E with the English, extinguish styles extremist
Bald head beamers run wild
It's the kid with the gold cup
Stepped out like what
What's poppin, and y'all niggas dobo
Blastin shae shae, chocolate shortae
Rich color mocks, rock those all day
1960 shit I'm Goldie
That's right motherfucker don't hold me
The world's greatest, Las Vegas, paid as rock
Skin painted on my face look ageless
Perfect combos, Ghost bang out condos
Jeff from Hamo, ex three bangos
Bancos, stank hoes in plain clothes
Change those, bang those, same old, same old


Yeah y'all, straight up this the jump off right here
The gravel pit, word up represent, rock the boulders
All my rich gangsta style, killers, y'all know what time it is
Shorty do your thing, get up on that shit right now boo, do you
That's what I'm talkin 'bout


Yo, step to my groove, move like this
When we shoot the gift of course it's ruthless
Grab the mic with no excuses
In a sec, grab the Tecs and loot this
Executing, shaking all sets, and I'm breaking all hecks
I'm taking all bets, move all best, who want the dram' next
You all stank, we got the bigger bank
Bigger shank to fill your tank
Still the same kill you for real, while you crank
Slide, do or die, fry to bake
Admire the greats, on fire wit a heart of hate
Bitter shark, every part I take, heavy darts that quake
It's okay, all fakes, get caught by the dropkicks
You know the thrill, yes it's Park Hill
Yo we hit 'em with the hot grits
On the go, check the flow, saying Wu don't rock shit
Stop quick, hold the gossip, stop sweating my pockets
I hear the hot shit


Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it
You don't have to move a mountain
Just give me enough strength to climb
Oh Lord ! Don't take away my stumbling vows
And lead me a round


Yakub, maker and creator of the devil. Swine merchant... your time is near at hand. Fuck with me and your time will be now. Your presence here effects the mind of my people like a fever. You, Yakub, are the bearer of nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine diseases, evil, corrupt, porkchop-eatin' brain!




Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
The special technique of shadowboxing


Poisonous, poisonous (word word word)
I should slap all y'all niggas for coming in my fucking face with that shit
Alright cool yeah, go ahead man...
Poisonous


Poisonous paragraphs smash your phonograph in half
It be the Inspectah Deck on the warpath
First class leaving mics with a cast
Causing ruckus like the aftermath when guns blast
Run fast, here comes the verbal assaulter
Rhymes running wild like a child in a walker
I scored from the inner slums abroad
And my thoughts are razor sharp, I sliced the mic from the cord
First to criticize, but now they have become
Mentally paralyzed with hits that I devise
Now I testify, the rest is I
Rebel INS Your Highness, blessed to electrify
With voltage of a eel, truth that I reveal
Will crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real
Caesar black down, hoodied up in fatigues
Part time minor leagues receive third degrees
Attack like a wolf pack once I pull back
The God-U and bust through like a fullback


Yo, you fourteen carat gold slum computer wizard
Tapping inside my rap vein causes blizzards
The wildlife that kills for ice trife like by the digits
Gorillas injected with strength of eighty midgets
The Earth spins, whirlwinds, rap exotic blends
Let my peeps in, niggas gasping, swallowing aspirins
With a dosage, you overdosed in rap
High explosives, my posters hypnotize with hypnosis
I sell goods, my whole Clan is on the run like Natural Born Killers
Record-breaking the album Thriller
Got access to tear gas, bombs and rocket launchers
Flow like dough, Killa Beez is what I sponsor
Your entrepreneur, pens in gear like Shakespeare
When I fuck I grab hair, collect drawers as souvenirs
Fuck yeah, my crew down German beers
My career's based on guns, throwing cats in wheelchairs
Etcetera, damage any lame ass competitor
Who try to front, get broken in fast like leathers
Whatever hot hardheads get shattered like mirrors
Beretta shots splatter your goose, scatter your feathers
Say never poetry chumps crumbs deal with graphic
Flew my family overseas, I'm maxing
If rap was crack, fully packed I be tall cats
Taxing kingpin of the rap drug trafficking
Village niggas get slapped in Manhattan
For rapping, Big Ghost steps off laughing
Ha!


Were you just using the Wu-Tang school method against me?
I've learned so many styles, forgive me


Sit back relax, fake niggas don't get turns
Watch me massage your brain with slang that's king
Projects filled with young men cause threats
Who has that? Thousand dollar chains and Tecs
Focus, the brokest niggas of life shit
These mics is like cocaine son, check the suicidal hype shit
Exchange mad blunts taste the sweepstakes
Keeping up on fakes outta state for cakes
No doubt, plus nobody amount, we making dough off
Putting fifty on the Land and Allah, it's like that
Pull ya shoes up black, matter of fact just adapt
Tie up, your black Nikes and tight hats
Corners stay surrounded with foreigners
What up, dread? Feds caught your bredren for his bread
But regardless, peace to jail niggas with charges
Unify laying in the yard with La
My Clan done ran from Japan to Atlanta with stamina
Slingers and gamblers and gram handlers
Tical light the Owl cigar, let's get steamed
Infra-red guard your beam, so seek 'nough respect
Rude bwoy you bet, keep it moving Mashallah
Pro black like tar
Designing the fly shit and stay shining
The RZA pour more beats than Cristal's fine wine
Concrete raps go to bat
With 50 other niggas on the other side of the map
Knew it's all good and all done what, we want son
Mike Tyson of this rap shit, pulling out Macs for fun


The nigga don't get mad, I got mad styles of my own
And it's shown when my hands grip the chrome microphone
Verbally I catch bodies with cordless shotties
Intriguing MCs, I keep em trained like potties
I bomb facts, my sword is an axe
To split backs invisible, like dope fiend tracks
Sky's the limit, niggas are timid and nobody knows
How we move like wolves in sheep clothes
Producing data, microchips of software
Underground and off air
The Land of the Lost, notorious henchman from the North
Striking niggas where the Mason-Dixon line cross




Another day, another dollar
I got mines, ain't got nothing to father
Fuck a role model, never had one to follow
Lot of cotton mouth rappers, I'm a hard one to swallow
Here's another hard one to goggle
Fuck your life, that's the motto
I'm nice with mics, Cus D'Amato
Drug related, blunt guts all up in your condo
Hate a noisy woman, why you all up in my convo


Let me hold something
Look at you killas, like you owe something
Stole something, give me my paper, 'fore I blow something
Right now, give me my fucking shit, chicka-blaow
I want it right now, give me my fucking shit, chicka-blaow
Shady niggas hiding the loot, you see my baby needs shoes
And the record label trynna recoupe
I want it right now, give me my fucking shit, chicka-blaow
And I mean right now, give me my fucking shit, chicka-blaow


Gun battles, so many chains on the neck
Hands and feet, niggas say I'm Shaq
Sky blue, terry cloth, low pullover
Hit ten like a 2010 new Hova
Movies on, never ran it, call me a don
Been shitting everywhere, cuz niggas can't stand it
Terminate faggots who violate us a square
Goon therapy, S.I., we don't fight fair
Beef? We can get it on, right here
And that includes y'all low niggas wearing tight gear


Sun God, and that's your target, aim right there
My money long and green like Buzz Lightyear
I'm all right here, the way I move the blow
Fuck a show, you would think it was an all white affair
Been fuego, more fire here, then you seen me
Getting money off the water like a pall bearer there
No Newports, Marlboro's here, go smoke that
The smoke in your face, bitch, I ain't never cared
Get shot down when the Ghost smell fear, let me hold something
Look in your face like you owe something




I'm playing for the 'bucks' like Hakim Warrick
Nickel bag in the park, my team on it
They want it like that and the street, is dry as a well
Hell, that's why I sell crack on the beat
I ain't trynna just happen to eat, I'mma make a nigga dance
Even if I got to clap in the street
This is something like lock up, murder behind bars
A warrior, my story defined by my scars
Seven thirty verbal, my word work circle
You a jerk, fool, I burn you like your birdds do






Get it burn it, get it burn it
Get it burn it, get it burn it
Get it burn it, get it burn it
Get it burn it, get it burn it
(The gun'll go, the gun'll go..., the gun'll go...)


Aiyo, one thing for sure, keep you of all
Keep a nice crib, fly away, keep to the point
Keep niggas outta ya face, who snakes
Keep bitches in they place, keep the mac in a special place
Keep moving for papes, keep cool, keep doing what you doing
Keep it fly, keep me in the crates
Cuz I will erase shit, on the real, note, you'se a waste
It's right here for you, I will lace you
Rip you and brace you, put a nice W up on ya face
Word to mother, you could get chased
It's nothing to taste, blood on a thug if he gotta go
All I know is, we be giving grace
This is a place, from where we make tapes
We make 'em everywhere, still in all, we be making base
Y'all be making paste, these little niggas, they be making shapes
Our shit is art, yours is traced


This is the way that we rolling in the streets
You know when we roll we be packing that heat
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go...


This is, Poverty Island, man, these animals don't run
Slums where the ambulance don't come
Who got the best base? Fiends waiting to smoke some
Approach something, ask him where he getting that coke from
My dudes hug blocks like, samurai shogun
Cause no V and no ones, equaling no fun
Who want to treat they nose, huh? Body'll go numb
My woman need funds, plus her hair and her toes done
It is what it is though, you fuck with the kid flow
That make it hard to get dough, the harder the kid go
Harder the piff blow, harder when it snow
The pinky and the wrist glow, this here, what we live for
Get gwop, then get low, but first thought
We gotta get the work off, the gift and the curse, boss
Yeah, see I'm the shit yo, the dirt in the fit, no
Hustling from the get-go, the motto is get more


This is the way that we rolling in the streets
You know when we roll we be packing that heat
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go...


We was quiet flashy brothers, strapped all along
With the dirty .38 long, twelve hour shift gate
Took case, state to state, you think he won't hold his weight?
Put ya money on the plate and watch it get scrapped
We get ape up in that club, off that juice and Henn
And it's a no win situation fucking with them
You mean like Ewing at the front at the rim, finger roll a Dutch
Million dollar stages touched, techs, gauges bust
Trust no one, the lone shogun, rugged Timb boot stomper
Damaging lyrical mass destruction launcher
Nothing can calm the quakeage when I break, kid
Peace to my brothers up north, doing state bids


This is the way that we rolling in the streets
You know when we roll we be packing that heat
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go...


Whoa... this is the way we be rolling in the club
You know when we roll we be packing .32 snubs
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go


Get it burn it...




Yo, hold on, this is the way that I'm cut, right?
Or why I sing, how I dipped under red lights
Martini's is Ghost Deini's, stretched out
On stage with the gauge, flash the TEC like Clint East'
Polo drawers, valour headband, Genova convertible couch
In the back, with the two nightstands
I'm the man, nigga, when I come through dressing rooms
Had the goose ready, renting cream and a bag of shrooms
And a nice suite, room service every five minutes, I need a foot massage
Tell the massause, she can't do it for me, do it for God
I got the mix CD on pause with all DeBarge
Oil me up, please, my nuts, read me a story
Tuck me in, something like the seeds'll say
Pass me the cold fresh squeezed OJ, I got five hundred
Under my pillow, after I'm done, do my DJ


Cause of that, I'ma rock the show tonight
The Twat Team, gon' get those hoes tonight
That's Theodore shit, if you in your whip
Two step, you slipped, get your whole crew wet


Stand like the Eiffel, move spiteful
Sport the Nike shoe, nice with the mic since high school
Fuck who like who, fend to not, niggas, trifeful
Plot cycles, to get dough, it's so delightful
Criminal IQ's, spiral convo's with the sky view
This is what I do, pioneer, my peeps Power Rule
Fuck Yacub, I'm factual, true and living
Polo polobos with the true religion, no superstition
This beat is sort of proof to listen, and hear the real
So you New Jack niggas kneel, sit it still
Lick a fifth, get your piff and chill, fix your grill
It's ill, seen the game vanish in air
From DeLores to the glamourest gear, show and prove
How I move, you know hammers is near, never fool
Appear rude, though my manners is there, get it straight
Say my grace, before stuffing my face


Cause of that, I'ma rock this show tonight
Hustle hard, I'ma get that dough tonight
Crime Money, all we do is just two step
Slip up, and get your whole fucking crew wet


Fuck the radio, the corners respect, Soldier I
I'ma about to get fly like I'm boarding a jet
Watch your mouth little homey, I demolish your rep
I'm like Mohamed Atta, when I'm bombing the set
Bottom line, you got a problem with Deck
I'm like the police gun, son, a nigga name pop in the 'jects
Hate in your blood, green eyes, watching my step
I'm all money like the Pres, no stopping the rest
This is Stones and grown man poking his chest
Play hero watch the K blow a hole in your vest
Why I flow like I know I'm the best, cause I'm spitting the piff
Half of y'all dudes rolling with stress
Come and see me, son, you know the address
10304 block work, first homey, show me the checks
Hood crooks living over the edge, Ghost saying nah
That's a good look, focus, respect, yup


Cause of that, I'ma rock this show tonight
Light your weed, pop ya ects', let's go tonight
House Gang on the dance floor, two step
You out of line, get your lame ass crew wet




Hang glide for my nigga Tical
Yo, word to God we run this whole shit Son (no doubt)
Right that's my word, guaranteed you're dealing with the invincible (no doubt)
(I'm specialized in swordsmanship)
That's my word, Persian Legacy one time, one time
That's the science of the black man
Stationary niggas, have fun on this right here
Yo Shorty cross your arms
Gonna rock niggas to sleep this year (throw your leather up)


Blade thrower, sword swinga, killa bee ringer
Rocky road roll dark greener
Cream fademas, name your God-U Kareema
Shout out Medina, federaloes Noxzema
Me, jewelery cleaner Million Man March screamers
Ray Catena, cut your joint Wolverine
The Longines, wrapped around the wrist, law seen her
How I got that yo, threw out the macker named Gina
Bust a shot, seen her, it richocheted, tapped Tina
Now I'm out, lampin in Korea with Talima
We moseyin, sweatsuit Adidas, best believe
I got the black heater little joint, probably Moschino
Yo Bobby Robby whattup, Max tried to follow me
Sadaam loungin, clean up collect, like the laundry
It's time yo swerve like the Nike line
Windbreaker Laker throw a jump shot scrape her
Statuary yo floatin that snatch-uary
Aiyyo, blow a hole in your limo, weed pass the dutch


Yo this is MC wizardry, killa bee invasion
Men of respect, blessed with wisdom of the ancients
My words are blatant, lacerate necks for statements
I launch like lead projectiles, straight out the basement
I suplex your rep, left ruined like the Aztecs
Parasites, double edge dice your larynx
My hip-hop, is quarantined locked inside the detox
Under key lock, it's like b-block and E-Glocks
You're ill, your trail ends, thoughts are frail
I strike the cypher, and let one survive to tell the tale
Of my state of grace, I raise the stakes on snakes
Knock em off like the big eights for takin up space
Never did fear em, stick em with the truth serum
Who sent em, arrest em before my charge is ended
Designated hitter flows split the transistor
Kinetic globes light when it shine, burns your retina
Urban journal, plus eternal broadcaster
Before and after, I be Self Lord And Master


I be the Ironside, get touched, with the chloride
Take walk with the Nine-Finger bandits worldwide
Shaolin hillside, full of homicides
FUCK you dissatisfied the double dyed black brown iodine


Yo, box talk sequence, powerhouse kickout
Eyes dusty, wet, butt-naked with my dick out
I'm direct, golden best, golden chest is blessed
Scarce chapter, snatch a batch of Winterfresh
It sound farfetched, mountain men that be rich
You get buckshot, dummy-clapped, mummy-wrapped and stitched
The Jeffrey Dahmer Notre Dame-r sing the song the strongest
Brute force bullethole straight through your chorus
Shank you with the think tank, harmony cake cut
A can of ass-whoopin', Flurry shake break, you fucks
Struck, love crooks, why for lyin hooks
Chef cocaine cook, a marvelous book
This deathbed doctrine, paper for the youth
What remains, a saber-toothed tiger in the booth


Last night, I took a trip down to Crown Heights
Fast life, females are trife, stay tight
I detect that parasite, satellite
RZA beat makes me wanna fight get hyped, come to do shows
My slang sound write secretary type
Backflip on the mic, I'm the poor black man
Workin hard for the grand, I understand clear
Don't fear, peep my new gear it's different from yours
My style drop like drawers, you see me on tours
Don't you wait to say peace, the kid from the street
Put my technology on the track, just then the core attack
Wu article, Cappa, five, CD attack
But my talk stage live killa beehive
Bermuda my life angle, rectangle gold fronts
Bring the gold bangle, never make me throw darts
Check out my arts, when I release my smarts
Hot like Pop Tarts, aim me at the charts




The Wu-Tang Clan will rise again
There are many of us, all working for the good of the Wu-Tang
Die


So get your egg crashed by my Hellz Wind Staff
While the pictures broadcast and splash to tell the news
Like Katie Chung, how the bullet collapsed his lung
His father watched in horror as he swallowed his tongue
Another youth dead before the age of 21
Left his son to grow in the ghettos of the slums
Where the shots echo for twisted metal for cash flow
React slow nigga and get P.L.O
By the lone gunner who took revenge for his brother
Who got slain last summer by a cocaine runner
A new year is dawning, new crews is forming
Rival gangs warring, blood steadily pouring
The streets are deep son, every day is like a rerun
So I reach out and try to teach one
But 85% uncivilized content
No tolerance so a lifetime is spent
Behind a cage bent smoked out and on a park bench
Killer instinct, slave rap niggas get lynched


So yo break that nigga arm fast as a fuck
Tell Ra, Goldie left my beige jacket in his truck
To all you slew-footed penguins, ducking from these
Hot rocks that's flaming, chocolate for all you rap Damians
Spraying cards espionage, dodgeball square hard
Strip bars, no bras, wet leotards
In the making, next album 'Blood on Chef Apron'
Keep a Gambino PlayStation in your playpen
Discovery Channel, cats the Book of Daniel
Coke blunts hot as a fuck swatted bamboo
High school dropouts, baseheads get knocked the fuck out
On the regular for robbing a good nigga house
Rough cut raw doses, the unexplainable
Hot rock lava, gringo throw the Frusen Gladj


What you know about this specialist armed dangerous?
Hit you close range with this madness
Unique design shine like a deep dish
The beat kick technique split up your weak shit
Yes, the rhythm, the Rebel
Alone in my level heat it up past the boiling point of metal
Living legend, veteran known to set trend
Lethal weapon, step through your section
With the force like Luke Skywalker
Rhyme author, orchestrate mind torture
Live performer, bid the mic saynara
Borderline to insane, I rain firewater
Tape recorder, can't be saved by a court order
I got my sword across your throat, you choke


We on the run with the golden guns, get you none
When it reach out and teach someone, blaze their buns
Now I'm guilty by association
Times of blackness eclipsing the Sun, target practice
Commence when I throw these darts at these rappers
Ricochet, hit the charts, bloody your mattress
Hold me down, Wu bloodkin, I'm going in
Shooting bullets at the top ten, rhyme concoction
Blend like chameleon
All these niggas want cheese, is we mice or men, word up
We can go platinum but then still can't get no satisfaction
Once again back on the block crumb snatching
Blowing backs in cold blooded 9 assassins, time for action
Johnny Unitas, handle that like arthritis
Still, hold a golden touch like King Midas


Drowning problems in Heinekens imported from Holland
Getting boosted off of Killa Bee pollen
Stone columns get stacked by drum tracks, smack loud like gun claps
Pin a crab to death with a thousand thumbtacks
The Wu centerfold, it be's the Wind Ninja scroll
Soul edged blade controls your Interpol
The Fig Newt', fruit from the forbidden tree root
I stay secluded in the Chamber training new recruits
With Fatal Guillotine, the black hooded team what it means
When bullet screams from the hot Glock like rock from a sling
Pushed through like George Bush Operation Whoops
Shots get popped on the block causing blood to gush
From digital to analogue, the Wu-Wear camouflage
My entourage squad be stomping through Zanzibar
Like herds of cattle, RZA plays the wall like a shadow
Connecting Brooklyn/Shaol like the Verrazanno-Narrows


Stash the cream though, Iceatollah ice style gleamo
Lex graffiti name Ramo, hold em we rolling asking me though
Raps is hotter than hot tamales in Toledo
Pussy that shit she passing off to me though
We wax Ajax niggas with an axe, Maxamill
You could crash a mil got your back still
Scold em and fold em like the thousand dollar bills
Sit back eyeing y'all niggas out
Fakes that delegate we spitting fire out
Verb burglar, design the Wally shoe store reserve a jet status
Guyanese bird up on my mattress
Watch me mack this, Ralph Lauren goose incite a fashion
Yo, these hands is flooded and they mad quick
Strong approach like magnets, custom wood crane name
Styling rich, rsum the waves and one chain
Feeling mics like, wheeling a bike, slide like
Step on his Klondike, get your dart right, we moving on it like
Wind breaker niggas get they face broke, jewelery get snatched
Magazine right on the low, fuck y'all cats




Windshield, rappers are like gnats
They're gettin' splattered 'pon the windshield
Fallin' down like London Bridge, my blade split your onion head
Axe that like Paul Bunyan, Meth prefers the gun instead
Bong bong, put a hole inside your head


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw


How come the streets don't want me to live?
Plus my niggas keep tellin' me fibs
But the devil done poisoned my wiz
I'm doin' this for my family and kids
I'm tryna be wealthy, take my time right and stay healthy
Said it before but I don't think nobody felt me
Yo tried to understand this hand that this life dealt me
I'm on the verge of a whole new makeover
My fake friends, they can take it like a takeover
I'm ready to eat, I'm ready to grip it
Got enemies everywhere, I got chicks that's wicked
Sick shit, niggas doin' wicked ass wig shit
Bid shit, tellin' jakes that I had the biscuit
Niggas be wantin' my leftovers
I'm like a general that died and lost some of his best soldiers
I burn holsters and I kill that dirt religion
Murk that pigeon and I shoot the television


Got that trey pound on you, run down on you
Hard boiled nigga, Clan top soil
My fam straight royal, I'mma die loyal
When them shooters come for you, better throw your flag 'em
I'm pure gun oil, let 'em see that hand cannon
Foundation strong, never ride a bandwagon
Andrew Jacksons, hand-to-hand transaction
Cops jumped out, caught him with his pants saggin'
Criminal individuals up in here
Wild like the theme park ride called The Buccaneer
Weed in the Tupperware, throw you off the upper tiers
Suweeee, I got all my niggas up in here


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw


Imagine the sound of your face scrapin' up against the gate
Of a barbed wire fence, this is barbed iron fist
Heartthrob, iron dick, hoes slob the nob quick
This is odd, so throw it in your iPod quick


Lifeless activity, constant movement
Buyin' elasticity, such improvement
Sword held to where it collapses inward
Spillin' rhymes if it's Shaolin vineyards
RZA had a mixture, then he added sound to the picture
Co-author rewrote the scripture
Math worked from birth, doubled the net worth
Amplified in the time machine of early Earth
A two-way radio, simple yet complex
Receivers, transmitters, interest to contacts
The emergence of the earliest atoms
Transform to a level extremely hard to fathom
Same soup, different bowl, Wu ceramics
Same group on them large-scale dynamics
A wave triggered the burst, glass was shattered
Galactic matter served on a graphic platter


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw


Overachiever, power hungry overeater
I95, whip fly like an overseer
I'm overconfident but some might say I'm overeager
Or overzealous, especially when it's over cheeba
I got a soldier's features, I rock the coldest sneakers
My sneakers' so cold, can't wear 'em 'less you hold the heater
Can't push me over either, that go for dojas
I ain't got no love for posers neither, keep my composure
I'm focused, tryna roll the reefer, let's turn it up
Forget the cope, I'm tryna blow the speaker, that's all he wrote
One verse could turn your soul to ether
It's time you gave me my respects just like the old Aretha
Mr. Meeeth


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw






Ayo, ayo, ayo, high potency Thai, smoke a bag of black
And feel the vibe, born to be wise, we form on a rise
The corner mean five, horns in disguise, throw on your slides
Young niggas racist, smokers is basing
We seen the eyes laying up, playing the cut, what?
Stay in the truck, something told me duck, folded me up
My shoulders struck out of luck, fucked the Pradas up
Fell in a daze like a Golotta snuff, niggas tried to body me up
I'm in the lobby bleeding, niggas in the waiting office probably eating
And sprinting and beefing when they heard the shots called the precinct
And seen barber nieces beast, some niggas shot Shallah features
And shot through his Ellesses, bent the spinal cordless creatures
I'm gagging and flagging a cab down
Guess who in the Benz wagon, dragging my sound down macking
It was Dale Breedy the greedy, conniving-ass snake genie
Cop with a bikini who murdered charge and benini
I'm feeling wheezy and I'm drained from the cheeba grieving
Ain't even looking decent, seeing police niggas reaching


That splash against my hollow bones
That rocks my...


Fleeing the crime scene speeding
Beefing leaving behind cream, not even peeping that I was leaking
Won't see the precinct just got a recent case beaten
Still jakes are creeping, don't blow your spot, stay the weekend
Keep the Ruger peeling who's squealing few knew the dealings
Keep the steel concealed in cause we got no time for feelings
Eyes on the building guards are on the corners illing
Million dollar block villain plotting on a killing
Feel like, a superhero talking like a true Deniro
They boost his ego found him broke down, reduced to zero
Cops fill reports hoping I'll reveal my source, source


That splash against my hollow bones
That rocks my soul


Outside the check cashing, flashing, dipped in fashion
Five cherry-faced faggots tried to cash in
They keep laughing  Ghost, you'll get your face bashed in
Who gave you these privileges son? Why you maxing?
And we... fiending to take those
Move slow, I'm hearing how you broke Rob's nose
And I heard you keep a banging hammer, golden brass
Diamonds embroideries that was stolen that you haven't reported, G
Make very little noise, my shit hiccup
Don't make this big stick up big up me and the boys
I thought for a second then chose rather than froze
Had the Gem Star in my hand... yo, what the fuck?
Yo, that's when I ripped Timothy, snatched and dipped
Jumped right in back of him, had the mini axe tool, faxed him
Shots rang off, bing-boggle-de-dum





The sword it's the best weapon of all
Two sharp edges, and a long spine
The blade is very thin and it's easily damaged
You remember that: the vital thing is the point
Pay special attention to it, your life could depend on it




Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump
Troops on the left, fight to the death
Fam on the right, infrared lights
Wolves in the back, ready to attack, for what
Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump


I pop off like a mobster boss
Angel hair with the lobster sauce
Summertime can't top the scorch
Check my hot broad, I dropped the Porsche
FBI wanna watch the force, trying to lock my source
Where I'm from, hear the macs, techs, Glocks and fours
Hide the safe, nigga, lock the doors
No respect for the cops and laws
In the land where your own blood brother still plot for yours
Seen things that'll drop your jaw
My soldiers got dropped in war, see the mural on the project wall?
Won't stop til I copped them all
Wanna block me? You gots to brawl, trade shots and all
Cuz I ain't on the clock for talk
The Spot Rusher, blow down the spot for sure
Still break off the block with raw, my stock is more
The General, watch your board


Deep pockets with the eight on me, sleep with the safe in the wall
The camo's on with the make-up and all
Swap six 45's, twist reefer in the flicks, papi whoadie ride
Bolt his gun off, from know your horse, she lied
Fly criteria, bury me in Africa
With whips and spears, and rough diamonds out of Syria
A true don, only I could do wrong
Rock fitted hats, get crack money and drive a sick blue joint
Retard-less, I'mma blow regardless
Resume is straight up live, I shank niggas up for larger E's
And speak with the youth in the spot, eat the fresh fruit in the crop
All these hip hoppers eat cock
You could see me in the street or the yacht
I'd rather be promoting your block or buying fresh sneakers with gwops
Yo, I'm an ill dude, always been a real dude
Don't fuck around, I will spill on you and kill you in the field, boo


Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump
Troops on the left, fight to the death
Fam on the right, infrared lights
Wolves in the back, ready to attack, for what
Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump


Leather jackets on, rocked up rock stars
Treacherous bank robbers, the plan go dub, we pop guards
The team gotta eat, seeds is hungry, that's why we ain't scared
To dump on niggas, our guns is chunky
Usually we bust niggas down with bats, swell up they joints
Elbow, wrists, they shins get cracked
We still humiliate, brutalize, Ruger pop, pulverize
Still got gear in the closet, that's stupid live
From Benetton rugby skullies, Oshkosh conductor jumpers
The train hats fit me lovely
Rae job is to make sure the coke is fluffy
While I politic his birthday bash with Puffy
Bagged Nia soon as I linked up, the kid ain't inked up
I'm an old mummy, my gold weigh as much as King Tut (yeah, yeah)
Slippers, robes is minked up, under the doorag, bro (uh, yo, yo)
My three dimensional fade is clean cut


Man, ya'll niggas ain't shit to us, still a pistol bust
Split your melon like I split the Dutch
Got a lot of piff to puff, and I ain't come for fisticuffs
Or for the cop that wanna clip the cuffs
Man, is Staten in this bitch or what?
Don't get it twisted, we, twist it up and even mixed with dust
See these fans can't resist the rush, they Wu-Tang for life
Scarred for life, they can't forget the cuts
Got a whole line of classic joints, and while you at it
Pass the joint, let's push this music past the point
Of no return, til it crash and burn, down the ashes
Then placed inside Ol' Dirty Bastard's urn
When it's my time to go, for sure, ya nigga goes to war
What you think I brought these soldiers for?
To send shot, like forget me not, at any nigga
Respect, bitch, that figure they gon' get me got


Heheh, your basic kung fu's no good
You can't move fast enough!
And you don't have enough strength!
And your body movements are like a street fighter!
It's too easy for me to trip you up!
(Fighting sounds)
Heheh, how's it feel, eh?
Ah, it's no good I feel my back's broken!
Heheh, you've still got a lot to learn!




Technique is ill son, watch how I spill one
Peace to Biggie, 2Pac, Big L and Big Pun
Havoc on the streets of Staten, snitches
House niggas, children watch as they produce the same pattern
Somebody raped our women, murdered our babies
Hit us with the cracks and guns in the early 80's
For those that murdered me shall stand before God
To fall at the hands of fate, then out comes the rod
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
What the fuck is going on, I can't go to sleep
Feds jumping out their jeeps, I can't go to sleep
Babies with flies on they cheeks, it's hard to go to sleep
Ish bowled two 6's twice, I couldn't go to sleep
Aiyyo we deep in the stairs, we carry big guns
Whippy got hit up with the big shit, bong bong
Stop at the cheeba spot, then pass the leak spot
Drove past y'all niggas again, you took a cheap shot
Not knowing, fucking with me you get your meat chopped
You thought we fell on our face, you need to be stopped
Call on the chariots, call on an ambulance
You better smile, my nigga you on Candid Cam
Gangsta broad, these be the laws, walk with big balls
Nigga, motherfucking eunuch, I even take which was yours
I'm the nigga that made you, man
When your rap wasn't doing well I'm the nigga that gave you a hand


Don't kill your brother, learn to love each other
Don't get mad, cause it ain't that bad
Look at who you are, you've come too far
It's in your hands, just be a man
Get the jelly out your spine
Cobwebs out of your mind


I can't go to sleep, I can't shut my eyes
They shot the father at his mom's building seven times
They shot Malcolm in the chest, front of his little seeds
Jesse watched as they shot King on the balcony
Exported Marcus Garvey cause he tried to spark us
With the knowledge of ourselves and our forefathers
Oh Jacqueline you heard the rifle shots crackling
Her husband's head in her hands, you tried to put it back in
America's watching, blood-stained ink blotches
Medgar took one to the skull for integrating college
What's the science? Somebody? This is trick knowledge
They try to keep us enslaved and still scrape for dollars
Walking through Park Hill, drunk as a fuck
Looking around like these Devils
I'm ready to break this world down
They got me trapped up in a metal gate
Just stressed out with hate
And just give me no time to relax and use my mind to meditate
What should I do, grab a blunt or a brew
Grab a .22 and run out there and put this fucking violence in you
I can't go to sleep, I can't shut em, son.. I


Don't let the game make you lose your head
You should be calling the shots instead
The power is in your hands
Stop all this crying and be a man




This is little Kane though
His little sobrero
(The ice cream truck is back mothafucker!)
(Check out this shit)
Yeah uh-huh (What?)
Eh yo.. eh yo eh yo


Aiyo, butter pecan Ricans, love a little candy girl
Caramel cover girl, love the way your body twirl
French vanilla cream, body work is mean
Chocolate fudge make a nigga wanna fall in love


Got them fat legs, killin' them Gucci's
Heels on, with the fat coochie
The way it's feelin' you seducin' me
Take time, create, yeah my legend is straight now
Ya inner vibe's the side of the juicy
Cheeba queen, treats on, jeans, state to state
And she got the nerve to fuck me all mean
While I rock all green, by all means
We in the mall fiendin', one more hump then I'mma scream
Boo throw me more of you, I'll take all four of you
We could flip it on the floor while I'm pourin' on you
Make me kiss it in the store on you
Cop the new drawers, the dick is all yours it's a mornin' blue
Straight mines, thats a warnin' duke
Watch me climb, that pussy looks shaped and designed
Yeah, line for line, rhyme for rhyme
That coochie is mine, I might just need it this time




Shut the fuck up and get in the car
Girl, your high beams is on, I wonder how they fit in that bra
We in the front seat, splittin' cigars
I'm on my job so you handcuffin' ho ass niggas, be on your guard
Especially on ladies night, I like it when they take a swallow
Straight out the bottle, but that ain't lady-like
I call 'em lil' pet names like Ma and Boo-Boo
So everytime I see your girlfriend, never confuse you
With the next down-ass chick, that play a part
That's cool enough to pardon my French menage a trois
Meth Man, real talk, don't mean to put you on the spot
But I know a spot to kick your heels off
I'm not as Dirty as that Bastard, be
But still a villain, I serve 'em Dick Dastardly
Here's a little taste of Ice Cream II (Ice Cream II)
So put some Vicky Secret on, trick, I might swing through




Yo, I love my dick-size, like I love women and shit
My head grew over these years, now I got a nice dick
Beauty mark right on my balls, girl, have a nice lick
Cute in the face, hair-do, you got some nice lips
Pussy monkeys holdin' my cock, just like it's vice grips
Part down the crack of your ass, your frame is priceless
Butter-butter caramel swirl, chocolate chip
French vanilla sundae girls, banana split
Cum drip down in your chin, right on your soft tits
Put your hand gently in mine, give me a soft kiss
What's really good? Girl, slip me your number
You blowin' up, and your lookin' Ice Cream this summer
Better than Beyonce, Halle Berry and them
Honey, you lookin' scrumptous, I ain't worried 'bout them
You my straight hood chick, girl, you more than a gym
You got that fat tight pussy like Notorious KIM
Butter-butter caramel swirl, chocolate chip
French vanilla sundae girls, banana split, uh..






When I write my lyrics, it's like, it's like
I want my shit to be phat, I want people to be able to understand
Yo, Anybody can rhyme, youknowhatimsaying
But it's what you saying that makes a person know about you
Knowhatimsaying, you know the type of person you is
So it's like really, I'm just more of just
Being a street narrator (aiyo, what up, famo?)

Reefer lit, love hip hop, the gangstas got me like the broccoli
Brooklyn baby cooling at a swat meet
Real niggas wanna meet me, ladies wanna eat me
Money clean Mercedes claim, baby, beat me
Love getting dressed up, sweats and techs
Ride around the hood, good, getting Gotti respect
Hand is golden, an OG rolling and holding, yo
Fresh kicks, soft leather, pockets is swollen
Let my jam hit your tape deck, it's straight up, and made up
For every real nigga with his gun on him, hate up
Flying through the city nights, new flights
Blue ice, hundred thousand in a Nike bag, license
Drug shop, I'm sorry, Atari in the Ferrari
Next see the Lex A Shallah, La Tam'pa
Eating yo, all of us, scamma gangstas
You know we honor, tip the kangol, cooling in the brown vengos

I have never, giving up on a mission
That's against my honor

Duke let me warn you, my niggas crip up
Them young boys'll run up on you, shoot your whip up
Brooklyn, nigga, beg for you life
And my Staten Island homeys lay your ass down on Glaciers of Ice
Sidewalk executives, live the street life consecutive
We built for this, go for your gun
My prospective is, another day in the life, of money and drugs
Big hammers and slugs, can get ugly as fuck

From the chest to your man Danze, ey
Staten Island, said what up, yo, ey
The homey ODB said what up, though, ey
We got the Chef on deck as if you didn't know
It's sharp as fuck, Wu, that's what up
Pack it up, wanna rap, wanna rock, what up?
Wanna pop, get up, fuck around and get your block hit up
Bring your team and we'll box 'em up
Think M.O.P. is not what up

It seems I'm a bit late here
Don't worry, these men are all gonna die

See from the side where it slum at, dum at, rum at
Cognac, combat, contact, contrast
Crom's packing out like Beyonce back
She bang out a song like the Fonz back
Bigger things, bring the slangs, slicker than the sharpest pen
Nigga here, combat, sweet dick Willie T, Rudy Ray Moore game
Woodgrain all in the board reigns, before rain flooded
Like storm drains, boss man, bundling raw 'caine
Fours bang, neighborhood war games
Get your weight up, you looking anarexic
Posted on the block proper with the hammer vested
Bitch came with empty hands, that's the hand she left with
Thirsty ass with the water and it sounded desperate
Break a white an hour, based it forty grand invested
Live within the third rail, you know the man electric
Shit was like the third world, until I handle metrics, that next shit



 Yo, check check it
 You can never defeat
 Yo, check the method of this shit right here one time
 The Gods
 Sparking your braincells to the upmost
 Impossible
 Unlimited epidemics being spreaded
 You can never defeat
 You know, we try and add on for y'all niggas
 The Gods
 Yo, yo


Fusion of the five elements, to search for the higher intelligence
Women walk around celibate, living irrelevant
The most benevolent king, communication through your dreams
Mental pictures been painted, Allah's heard and seen
Everywhere, throughout your surrounding atmosphere
Troposphere, thermosphere, stratosphere
Can you imagine from one single idea, everything appeared here
Understanding makes my truth, crystal clear
Innocent black immigrants locked in housing tenements
Eighty-Five percent tenants depended welfare recipients
Stapleton's been stamped as a concentration camp
At night I walk through, third eye as bright as a street lamp
Electric microbes, robotic probes
Taking telescope pictures of globe, babies getting pierced with microchips
Stuffed inside their earlobes, then examinated
Blood contaminated, vaccinated, lives fabricated
Exaggerated authorization, Food and Drug Administration
Testing poison in prison population
My occupation to stop the inauguration of Satan
Some claim that it was Reagan, so I come to slay men
Like Bartholomew, cause every particle is physical article
Was diabolical to the last visible molecule
A spaceknight like Rom, consume planets like Unicron
Blasting photon bombs from the arm like Galvatron


United Nations, gun bias style patient
Formulating rap plural acapella occupation
Conquer land like Napoleon, military bomb fest
We want sanitary food, planetary conquest
Thug peoples on some hardco' body shit
Get your shit together 'fore the fuck Illuminati hit
Dreams is free and escape is sleep
For a fool peep jewels, keep tools for tough time
The rule of rough mind, elevate, stay behind
The sun gotta shine, keep on, cremate
The whole Babylon, times up, move on
Kings on your pawn, checkmate, no fakes
Supposed through the gate, case closed
Things get froze, when it comes time, chosen ones
Will holding guns, we take flight with no fright
And attack, never fear cause our words is clear
What's been done can't be undone Son, we can't care
Cause the last days and times are surely here
Snakes and flakes get blown, by the righteous ones
Divine minds bind, we unified as one
Half of black folk, we half broke, smoke a bowl of weed shit
Our everlasting essence stay flying over Egypt


For you to defeat, the Gods
Impossible, you can never... defeat
The

Gods
Impossible
For you to defeat, the Gods


Call an ambulance, Jamie been shot, word to Kimmy
Don't go son, nigga you my motherfucking heart
Stay still son, don't move, just think about Keeba
She'll be three in January, your young God needs ya
The ambulance is taking too long
Everybody get the fuck back, excuse me bitch, gimme your jack
One, seven one eight, nine one one, low battery, damn
Blood comin out his mouth, he bleedin badly
Nahhh Jamie, don't start that shit
Keep your head up, if you escape hell we gettin fucked up
When we was eight, we went to Bat Day to see the Yanks
In Sixty-Nine, his father and mines, they robbed banks
He pointed to the charm on his neck
With his last bit of energy left, told me rock it with respect
I opened it, seen the God holdin his kids
Photogenic, tears just burst out my wig
Plus he dropped one, oh shit, here come his Old Earth
With no shoes on, screamin holdin her breasts with a gown on
She fell and then lightly touched his jaw, kissed him
Rubbed his hair, turned around the ambulance was there
Plus the blue coats, Officer Lough, took it as a joke
Weeks ago he strip-searched the God and gave him back his coke
Bitches yellin, Beenie Man swung on Helen
In the back of a cop car, Dirty Tasha are tellin
But suddenly a chill came through it was weird
Felt like my man, was cast out my heaven now we share
Laid on the stretcher, blood on his Wally's like ketchup
Deep like the full assassination with a sketch of it
It can't be, from Yoo-hoo to Lee's
Second grade humped the teachers, about to leave
Finally this closed chapter, comes to an end
He was announced, pronounced dead, y'all, at twelve ten


Now what my man is trying to tell y'all
Is that across the whole globe
The murder rates is increasin, and we decreasing
So at the same time, when you play with guns
When you play with guns Son
That causes the conflict of you going against your own
You hear me, so let's pay attention
Straight up and down, cause this is only a story
From the real




"The story you're about to see, occured along the main
Trading route, on the border between the North and South..
At a small outpost called Red Clay Village."


What the fuck y'all niggas thought, huh? What you thinkin bitch?
Are you stupid son, must be stupid kid
What the fuck is wrong? It's the Wu bitch
Ain't got a clue bitch, tie ya shoe bitch
Get the fuck back, 'fore we break a f... listen
Tryin to tell y'all niggas, give you a fair warnin
Just a chance to live, so you can see ya kids
Yo son nah, before I split ya wig
I'd rather feed you this, but you ain't wanna eat it
So now you got to FEEL IT!!

Beat changes
Yo what the, yo
Let me fuck it one more time then y'all can fuck
Y'know how we do it in the hood
Yo.. yeah.. turn the mic up, yeah, yo
Y'all niggas better rock y'all hoodies
Take money snatch jewelry, in the hood
You find the best woman lookin good
Diamond she need polishin
In my hood, all the gunshot legal
At the same time we gotta stop killin our people
Keep it in the hood, niggas walk with they gun
Keep it in the hood that's where we come from
I rep Brooklyn, home of the gangsta
I know a few murderer, drug dealer
In the hood, we speak mathematics and build
What's the total weight of the brain, Allah real
Slang jacks and hold gats, in the hood; 80 proof
Get my dick sucked on the roof of the projects
Dice game in the park, blunt sessions after dark
Movin with the Wesson
Welcome to the God we build and drop a lesson
Pussyhole testin, in the hood
Got the word from the hoodrat, shorty on the wood


Murder, bad boy ya block off ah
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah
Murder, nine millimeter me say
Murder, no time fi talk, one fi
Murder, men an' dem ah talk 'bout di
Murder, Masta Killa come calm wit nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying, me say murder


Ay yo, we boys in the hood, big bad wolves in the woods
It ain't all good, pass the goods
Deep in the project halls waitin to shine
Walk with a nine and talk with gang signs
In the hood, niggas put twenty on Hoopties
Four heads, one forty ounce and a loosie
And keep dough on the flip, a ho on the strip
And roll dick throw on the flip
Weed clouds thick enough to block the sun
Cops come, but thugs never drop the gun, understood?
Far from ya Hollywood
From day one, I vowed I would keep it in the hood
From project chicks with hips and slim waists
From five dollar plates apartment six-eighths
O.G, I spit G to the young ones
I keep it in the hood that's where I come from


Murder, bad boy ya block off ah
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah
Murder, nine millimeter me say
Murder, no time fi talk, one fi
Murder, men an' dem ah talk 'bout di
Murder, Masta Killa come calm wit nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying, me say murder


This is the place where thugs is born
In the hood - Blink to long ya life is gone
In the hood - Convicts still live with they mom
And they whole family tree is tattooed on they arm
In the hood - Crack fiends'll furnish a 'Llac
In the hood - African's be drivin cabs
In the hood - In the streets the ghetto is hot
And the illest gangsters, on the block with cops
In the hood - The ones you love'll fill you with slugs
In the hood - Babies born addicted to drugs
In the hood - We make life or death decisions
And the school system is like a minimal prison
So you can't knock the hustle or the life that I'm livin
In the hood - it ain't all good, repent or you sinnin

 (x2)
Murder, bad boy ya block off ah
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah
Murder, nine millimeter me say
Murder, no time fi talk, one fi
Murder, men an' dem ah talk 'bout di
Murder, Masta Killa come calm wit nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying, me say murder




Shout out to Morocco, what's going down?
This your boy, MEF, Mr. that is
Capital M, capital E, capital F
I'm here to speak upon things, one of your hometown favorites
My boy Cilvaringz, doing big things upon this
We gon' make it pop like this
Ya'll wanna see what time it izzy
Man, this is in the name of Allah
RZA, Shabazz the Disciple, Masta Killa
Killah Priest, your boy John-John Blazini
Let's do it


Listen, the wise elder spoke, write as I quote
Then open the seal, and reveal these things
That will come to pass, if you can last through the storm
Man will be tested in all forms
Then flesh will be beaten until submission
Forgiveness has been given to spare your life
Still your eyes glaze when you greet my wife
Sinful thinking, it's strong wine and drinking
Lead to the destruction of such men as Samson
The grace period given for those who will repent
Those other than righteous, Masta Killa will send
And time is at hand, as I walk the land
From the U.K., back to the streets of B.K
Given sight beyond sight, to write the unseen
No amount of treasure can measure the gift given
To speak the unspoken, it's the chosen


I need one cup of Dracula's blood, two virgins
Dressed in all black, to start my sermon
One heart of a merchant, one teeth of a priest
The head of a monk, mixed in a bowl, with the 9/11 souls
I see him in the sign as the reverend was told
I read the scroll, but I'm still blindfold
Wait, I need more ingredients, so I look for the seeds of disobedience
Chop off the foot of Bush, throw him in the pot, let him cook
To every word I jot in this book, I pray the FBI's overlook
The recipe for America's destiny
Tech will squeeze, after dragging, I stab him in the abdomen
Free the Palestinians, free the Africans
Free humanity from the insanity, our planet bleeds
Mission cycles of symbols and idols
Our skin put Bibles, Qu' Ran, been through temples to old mosque
Stepping through the Garden of Eden where the revengeful angels throw rods
Oh God, save us from the outrageous Pagans, I spray guns, til the barrel's empty
I'm like Moses to Pharaoh's envy, turn of the century
Burning in misery, think...


In the, name of Allah, who we give thanks and praises
They turn us from the wages, watch over your saviors
He gave us life, made us upright and raised us
He wrote the book, we live according to your pages


When the holy father spit, you see the bottomless pit
Demons rise out, Shabazz close the door, this God's house




Titanium fangs, skull nearly mammal
At the holy city of Mecca, on the back of a talking camel
Grey Flannel Cologne, crazy ammo get blown
Wherever I sit son, that is my throne
I'm the reason why time started, I be the kind hearted
Trying to bust me, you aiming at a blind target
Designed with a sublime for the vintage
I control the whole, don't deal with no percentage
Even with a 3.5 mil deposit
Your life is still illusive like a CGI composite
Where your mind and your body discombobulate
Need to regenerate, let your mental seed ovulate
For nine months, in the womb of my wisdom
You may find a program to descramble the system
And cause a glitch, whether bright day or black pitch
We strive to build homes, and stack chips
From the ice of Alaska, to the heat of Calabasas
We over through the master, he build our own castle
Remove the impostor, take it up an octave
As my vibe continues to energize your chakras
Out of Allah mercy, I speak these verses
To help bring the truth from beneath the surface
To help get the proof, from beneath the churches
Defeat Shaitan, and complete the circle


I move with a strike of elegance
Like Saladin on a horse, backed by seraphim
Where flowers open and my past and unruled is downhill
But see, I'm quick to the back
The fate for the house of Mecca, the stone of Abraham
My word alone will enslave a man
Deeply to the sword of Islam, though he resides with his mom
In the Pagan land, the shit's calm
Praying to the cross of Christ, what is right
But the Qu' Ran claims Christ never lost his life
To the crucified punishment of Roman justice
And that's why the Bible cannot be trusted






What up Prince Rakeem, Masta Killa, Cilvaringz
John Blaze, S.T.D., in the name of Allah
(Yo, yo, one-two, one-two, turn my mic up a little bit
Turn the headphones up just a little bit
Turn the frequency up a little, yo...)




Murder one of y'all niggas..
Get to hurtin one of y'all niggas..
Bitches, snatch the shirt off one of y'all niggas
Kick dirt


Color Glocks splitters just listen there's UFO visitors
Fly paintings remainin, reclinin pro-comissioner
One boot off he Rudolph, know he hyped flew off
Hibernatin, dead in the makin, ear-rake him, gear-rake him
Technician murderer, Wu hit the universe
Our words is crush, fingers icy slush, ringers wants Mercedes bust
Tip bottles, Movado, sailin in some Wu goggles you follow
Mail and jail letters, sendin niggas lottos
What made you murder my flow, what made you rival my clothes
What made you  fuck it, yo son these niggas gotta owe
I think a lot of flows, I flip exotic hoes
We paintin pictures if it's was drizzies, seen a lot of those
Gettin fly with Ghost, Power just buy the boats
RZA your vision is exquisite, daddy hide your scrolls
Platonic chronic shows, tonic prose
Off the meter Panasonic know, son line me a ho


Devestatin shockwaves strikin the nation
Newsflash, warn the people, assassination
The hour of detonation, pure untampered or mixed in any form
In any form mixed untampered it's pure
Dissect each line of the rhyme
Find my ingredients and nutrients
Teach patience and obediance before movement
Killer bee student enrollment
I'm out your control and expose if it's synthetic
Quote these plush degrees as I inject, there's many at risk
Slang therapist Shallah Rae
Bless the people, with magnificent wordplay




Aiyyo you know the half, some get respect, most we show the path
They quoted tracks while we spoke math, blowin fast
Expose the craft, first picks chosen in the draft
I don't flash, hoes love me cause I hold a stash
Known to blast, paramedics couldn't close the gash
Floatin past in a 'Nail with the oak dash
Show the cash, watch it blow in half, it's no fair
They goin mad, check their tape recorders and their notepads
Crabs wanna play me close and grab
Can't believe you on the canvas, I'm just throwin jabs
Where the powers you supposed to have, hand in your soldier rag
You posin bad, show your ass son, you won't last
With heavy weights that elevate the whole mass
Compose a smash, rollin grass at Ghost lab

{*samples scratched: "drink to your new life.. iron flag brothers"*}








Yo... yo... yo... yo, yo


Time to knock 'em out, cut 'em with the glass hand
Time to shut 'em down, I'm coming out the badland
Oscar the Grouch, kid, jumping out the trashcan
The last man that violated, got chopped with the sword
Send him a one way express ticket to see the Lord
You think we falling off, the beef's internal
All that bullshit we going through, it don't concern you
I'll thermonuclear burn you, you'se a human sacrifice
Cuz I be smashing mics with the Passion of Christ
Stay fully loaded, equipped with action devices
Kid, stashing these stripes, join the force
Honey, take ya flick, lift and point to the boss, soon
As you blink, your coins is tossed
It only takes four bars to get my point accross
And I'm cold as winter frost, on top of the mountains
Elijah, was the prophet, along came Malcolm
And I'm scalping niggas, taking devil's heads
Money generated, niggas taking heavy bread


I was born in a barrel of razor blades
Right next door to haze, I used to be afraid
Of the devil, as a boy, but now as a grown man
I realized, he is just a toy
A grafted image, of the magnificent splendid
Dominant, prominent, Islamic
I was here before the dinosaurs, shine and defining law
Measure every inch of the Earth, combining more
Elements and chemicals, fire, space, and minerals
Kept devils on the run, like Monk-Monk the General
Appear in a gang attire, slept in a ring of fire
I, got a bigger beat than Billy Squier
Dirty Dick Dastard' dart, straight out the dungeon
Transform on niggas like the rail whip from London
Paul Bunyan ax tracks, get peeled, caps back
Hard to get out, nigga, head like naps
Parental advisory, no M.C. is wisin' me
Me and the mic, like, ebony and ivory
We go together, like, cheese and cheddar, like
Jeans and sweater, like, Mo' and better, like
Who could take a sun ray, twist it to a rainbow
Darts sit upon your head like the Kangol
V is for Victory, I mastered your trickery
Tryna clock like dickory, get smoked like hickory
So please stop the bickery, you can't get rid of me
Wu Killa Bee, from now to infinity


Look at this bitch ass, snitch ass, about to get a kicked ass
Get mad, get smashed, and get another zip bag of 'dro
For these ho niggas, slow niggas, told niggas
Fucking with the coal miner's daughter, she a gold digger
Killa, I'm back iller, been realer, chinchilla
Coat, ex-crack dealer, cap peeler, dope
Uncut coke, cut throat, niggas had enough dough
What up, though? My nigga, I don't trust no bitches
That's real shit, feel this, vanilla Dutch and steel lick
Forensics is still tryna figure how I killed it
Wu-Tang, my crew bang, let our nuts hang
Like that piece on a new chain, mami, pop the poontang
Your party, find me where the stars be, or probably
Walk into the corner store on Targhee
Smokin' Bob Marley's, I'm hardly, a nigga to be fucked with
And you tryna 'catch up, but you barely cut the mustard, aight then


Just another spine chiller, U-G, RZA
M-A-S-T, A-K-Illa, M-E-T-H, O-D gorilla, straight from the Killa
Brownsvillah, do or die Bed-Stuy
Murderer, East terrorist, we clap gun thunderist
Land of the Iron Gods, swords can't live
Medina stay warrior, how can I escape the block
From being boxed off, lost in the shuffle of life
Living right cost, legendary crime boss
Fresh kicks drip in the street, beautiful unique
Freestyle, be so wild, fresh out the Penal
Track it on the Pro Tools, foul, smooth as blue nile
Wave spin, water blend, dart flow, sun glow
Kool Moe Dee roll, gang up on a power show
Snoop never love a ho, bang it on in your vehicle slow
You don't know how the God be flipping the style
And keep it so, Witty Unpredictable
Truth or Natural, the Gods is actual
It's a fact, I was destined, to grab the mic and bless them




Me.. me


(It's all about who?) It's all about me


Booga booga bang! Yo Enter the Wu-Tang Clan
Get a god damn, yes I am the man
And I'm gonna blow, make mad dough
Girls sweat me cuz I've got the flow
Not the one to front when it comes to a stunt
I be quotin books like brothers smoke blunts
And do what you got to do, hold your own
Don't try to pass me just Pass the Bone
I get slam just as the hit rams
See? A girl flipped hands cuz she wanted to jam
I told her, "Yo be on your very way
I'm not gonna be your's, I won't beg you to stay"
Hey, what's the hardest thing about it? Like De La Soul
Between me, myself and I, it's a small world
I have to figure out, what is life about
It's all about me!




Here I come, here I come with the Wu-Tang drum
It ain't no fun if I don't get none
So I got mines, you better get your's
When it comes to Kim's, you better get your's
Ooh, kind of frisky, could this be it? Risky
I pull stings on you, like girls hit me
The incredible, talk unforgettable
Talk what I do, chew when I walk
On Pillsbury dough, I'm hittin like a ho
Forty-five, then I strike like lightnin bolts
In the sky, right for your eye
I chop off the head of the guy that despise
First to merk me meets the controversy
Who'll be the first MC to try and curse me?
Watch watch watch watch me knock him out
And tell him what it's about, it's all about me




Master of the Wu-Tang, here I am again
About to ill again, kill 'em with my pen
Check 'em check 'em, watch me as I wreck 'em
Brothers jump up like a straw as I disect 'em
I was all wild when I fouled your whole style
The crowd gets wild in the Isle, then I bow
Gotta have it, see a mic, I grab it
Here's a fat ass, fast I gotta stab it
Hanky panky, the rap suckers thank me
So many brides, I end up with a blank G
See? I'm not the one to be played
Got a gun now I'm not afraid
Quick to put a savage in the grave
The behavior possessed by the nature
Population causes me to be a slayer
So I walk around takin devils out
And show 'em what it's about, me






Machine gun Rap for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, linebacker nigga flash stacks
See through yellow lines, rock a fly jersey in the summertime
God, magic marker rap, bleed betadine relaxed
Wrote this, coming at you crab ass culprits
Snatch ya ice off, chilling in the back, throw the lights off
Waves, water blend, rhyme flow in slow motion
Thick snare, I'm feeling like a snail in the ocean
What's your wish? Wanna Kringle like Kris? Melodic single darts
Snap a nigga just like fish, you fucked up
Some rich niggas you done test, yo
Select the wrong apartment and niggas pulled up your dress
Style, molest that, Canal chain, nigga where ya vest at?
Flex'll make me wanna bless that, yo
Saddam Hussain niggas, light the torch, we flaming niggas
Autograph that, flatten all the main niggas


(It's Yours!)
The world in the palm of your hand
(It's Yours!)
Twenty-three million of useful land
(It's Yours!)
The seed and the black woman
(It's Yours!)
Double LP from Wu-Tang Clan
(It's Yours!)


Yo, super freak physique like Raphael Saadiq
Baby love the ganja leaf everyday of the week
Super friends wake up, deluxe gourmet beats
The night is right, I might find me a suite
It's a quarter full moon, I arrive, women swoon
Well groomed, dance hall packed, full room
Lady move, peep my glide, peep my zoom
Keep in stride, smoke the lye smoke the boom
Feel the fumes, consume toxic tunes
Hell bound, species forty ounce typhoon
The ultra-violet scream machine move your body touch
The totem pole wobble, Ark builders, God's thrust
Beams of light, stop ya breathing, it's hunting season
Honey eye-balling down for no reason
Grab her close, play post, wind and wax floors
Never mind the laws cause tonight It's yours


Stop the fader of the RAM, blast more watts through my pre-amp
Them can't stress the beat vamp the shit'll get blamp
At full throttle, hot lead propels throughout my nozzle
Crack your soul like bottles, leave you stiff as models
You fag, you couldn't pull one drag off my blunt
You couldn't punch your way out of a wet paper bag
With scissors in your hands bitch the RZA
I stand close to walls, like Number 4 The Lizard
And channel through solar panels, blast off like Roman Candles
Rap vandals, stomp your ass like Wahoo McDaniel
You cocker spaniel dogs, can't fuck with our catalog
Put your lights out and leave your brain inside a fog


It's only natural, actual facts are thrown at you
The impact will blow trees back and crack statues
Million dollar rap crews fold, check the sick shit
Explicit, I crystallize ya rhyme till you can sniff it
We live this, fitted hats low conceal the crooked eye
No surprise, verbal stick up, put 'em high
Rebel I outlaw, split second on the draw
Blow the door off this shit like bricks of C-4




Check out my beaver, baby blue Glock in the safe
Seen Dorothy in the garden getting ski row eight
We hold a belt Son, that's my word
Spot a rapper run him down, throw him out in the third, yo check it
I think like the man behind a register
Evergreen smoking estates, Divine and Power made me treasurer
With third down, six to go flash his strobe lights
I'm open, RZA hit me off lovely and I love him
With root beer thoughts, here's a tennis court for your birthday
The babyface of Rap politic with Sade
Avenging eagle crooks, rock the "W" and "Spiegel" books
Anheuser-Busch kings came through and stopped your whole Juks
Spitfire Kangols, watch Tony train a gang of hoes
Painful like hearing the news, like when your man go
Ends blow, windy at times watch the room
Sexy girl love the shit out the song, now watch her water break



(*Prod. Fizzy Womack, Bob Perry:]


This was my favorite girl for years, she knows the way I perform
Sometimes I pull my boxers down, ya'll, with one Timb on
It be times, you know I stay away when her friends on
For some reason, she be really hot, when her friends gone
That's when I slide on over with a Guinness on the stouffer
To talk a little shit, then get a little closer
Like, what up boo, you know that Ghost loves you
I get butterflies when we hug and kiss, do you?
Huh? Answer me, let me if it's the truth now
That pretty mole above your lips looking cute now
Ooh child, I'm patient, my mind's telling me
To stay calm, I wanna get it off like a G bomb
On top of your skin, I'm sliding it in
When I'm done, you can wake it up and ride it again
Then we can hold on through the night, fan on and covers on
It's bright from the TV light, peace, good night

Looking out my window, sun shining bright
Birds are singing, trying to make things right
Now I got music, oh, on my radio
And I can hear love songs playing, behind closed doors
Now I don't want no one, on the catch me side
But ever since you left, said goodbye


I wish you were here with me
I said I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here, with me

And thinking bout your kiss, gloom all around me
Seen our love, is never gonna find me
And I keep looking, oh, for that brighter day
When all I see is, time slipping away
Oh and I got to talk, to keep myself together
But all I see is stormy weather



Now I got to get, get myself together
Cuz I can't take no more, of this stormy weather
Now I wish you were here with me
I wish you were right here
I wish you were here with me, ooh



Night falls and I call for you, love
But there's no one here to answer
No, no, no, oh
The wind blows and I turn to catch ya
But there's no one there but my reflection
No, oh I said I wish you was here with me




Him speaketh in tongues into the hearts of all flesh
Yeah stanyoi
Whoi


Oh God, I beg for forgiveness
So help me Lord, yes I beg for forgiveness
Deep in my heart, please, I'm crying for forgiveness
Allah U Akbar, I fall to my knees for forgiveness
Branded by the steel iron, bullets flying
Ladies being hit through wickedness, I'm losing my grip
I thought we lived by the books, The Bible, Koran
We pick cotton, my back is still hot and dark and
They threw burners in our babies' faces
Pale hands that looked scary touched our bodies in the strangest places
Sweat from the white man's head
Fell on our daughters as she cried, giving white man head
Almighty, alrighty, niggas is screwing
God won't you tell me why these ho niggas is screwing?
I'm sorry father, sacrifice me, leave me wife
Sacrifice me twice, so my kids can see paradise...


So we heed our God king Selassie I, Jehovah God, Jah Rastafari
Who is seated in Zion and reigneth in all
In the hearts of all flesh - whoa wow
Let my task oh Jah with them that strive with me
Fight against them - whoa wow
That fight against me - whoa wow
Take hold thy shield and rock and stand up for my health
Oh Jah, oh Jah, only you can comfort me
La la la, la la la la la, la la la la
La la la whoi stand out


Curse to the wicked snakes who try to snatch the truth away
Cursed be the ones who try to take our youth away
Peace to the black, the brown, the red, yellow, and white seed
We don't discriminate man over color/creed
They tried to snatch up our beats, son, and steal our culture
And German Catholics, whitewashing Roman sculptures
How dare you try to deny Allah's intelligence?
Kidnap the truth, and destroying the black evidence


Glory be to the father
Glory be to the son (Glory be to the holy one)
Glory be to the holy one
The holder of creation whoi
As Jah was in the beginning is now and forever shall be
Jah world... Jah world without end whoi
So we heed our God king Selassie I, Jahova God, Jah Rastafari
Who is seated in Zion and reigneth in the hearts of
In the hearts of all flesh whoi

Spontaneous combustion got niggas lustin'
Fuckin' with this head bustin' track spanker
Decaffinator, crab sinker, twenty-five
Tryin' to live to see my forty acher, before I die
Immaculate conceptions like loaded weapons
Shootin' up ya rap session in mere seconds (Bluh! Bluh!)
Ya whole style is undressin'
Try to hide yaself behind the R&B section
And got spotted, fuckin' with them fake artists who make garbage
Now ya like a human target with no direction
And no protection, rap nigga assed out and no question
Dead and buried, we holdin' like the military
Fuck Dog Shit, hide-out beats and hot cherries
On virgin mic's, style very cri-Tical
By any means necessary, mad lyr-ical
The Ghostrider, want vengeance on you style biters
Ya whole sect got you gassed 'til I sparked the lighter
And burnt that ass like Dhalsim in Street Fighter
I play the shadows, scopin' out you lime lighters and Desperados


Killa Beez is ridin' East to West, baby
See our twenties spinnin' on our trucks, baby
Diamonds, Cubans hangin' from our neck, baby
Come on, come on


{Baby cuz It's Not a Game}
You see them mothafuckin' twenty-inch chromes spinnin'?
{Rocked out, baby, ice hangin'}


Bailed out from drugs, almost retired from bubblin'
Hammers was the guns under the rug, lift off my publishin'
Jet to Miami, I chuggle-lug the beat
Fiends beepin' me, I erase and delete (Come on)
Surrounded my palm trees and sound-proof condos
Tryin' out Spanish foods, Roberto's bangin' bongos
Do whatever, crackin' down weather, it means nice
Walkin' down the strip, these fat niggas broke the ice
Drive it in a host, the trucks, the gate's wide open
A square box fell out, I'm hopin' it be coke and
I snatched it, dipped into a parkin' lot and wrapped it
See diamonds, pearls, rubies, gems, covered with acid
Heavens to mega-troid, infants'll know I'm paranoid
What she goes through, I'm on a next flight to St. Croix
Sneaker boy and Genius, I heard he struck oil
Him and Masta Killa own Fox and mad loyal


Diamonds, Cubans hangin' from our neck, baby
Come on, come on


{The finest, baby, the finest}
(You see them Linx hangin'?)


Yo, yo
You know I rarely fight, I keep heat plus I'm very nice
I run with two-eighties on me like Jerry Rice
I fuck with many birds, not the canary type
I've seen a lot of happy days and scary nights
My click hotter than fish grease, kids be diss-free
Most of these labels can't handle this heat
I love new twat, scrap ho's on a few blocks
When my hate grows I let the tools pop
A lot of these rap niggas be fast to plea
Raw cook up, Got the Hook-Up like Master P
F.G., we don't talk, nigga, fast to squeeze
Walk up and let a hundred shots crash ya V
The first to pull out, the first to body somethin'
I got all the heat all the shorties in ya lobby pumpin'
Them dudes you standin' with probably frontin'
Killa Bee Gang got that shit that keep ya hottie jumpin'

The next chamber's the mothafuckin' weather)
Look out for the Stingers, baby




I ain't trying to be no D-boy, I love music, I'm a b-boy
Are you the undercover or the decoy
I'm heavy with the D, Trouble T Roy
A pit with no muzzle about to bust your bubble like a keloid
Too much marijuana got me p-noid
I'm killing instrumentals with that All So Simple Can It Be, boy
Shout to Lil Cease, B.I.G., boy
And Funk Doctor Spock, I mean Redman that's not Leonard Nimoy
88 keys on the keyboard
I'm down to catch wreck, take them first three letters out of record
It's Meth, you heard it through the wire I could be more
Or washed up like Sonny Black's body on the seashore
That's a problem, I could be yours
A monster without the mad scientist and Igor
I've heard it before, a third of these boys
Got murder raps and never even murdered before


Keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
Keeping the streets locked
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
Keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
Run these streets out here don't need cops
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block


Codename Sensei, I live what my pen say
Game hall of fame, flow is MJ, Muy caliente
Je m'appelle Rebel, capisce, comprende?
Son I'm touching 'em up, trust I'm like
Justin Tuck how they ducking the rush
Tryna Break Bad, you catch a bad break
Like I own a bake shop how I stack cakes
Greatness was nothing, Deck the next Nike ad
Wifey bad and my life got 'em slightly mad
Cause I shine like chrome in July
Soldier I opened your eyes, notice the lies
DEA say I'm drugging 'em
I get you leaning hard, I get the fiends to nod, I mean they loving 'em
All hail your highness, terrific win
Put a so-called beast in his place, Pacific Rim


Keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
Keeping the streets locked
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
Keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
Run these streets out here don't need cops
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block


Foul ass police, crooked ass friends
I don't give a fuck yo, the drama never ends
I'm a project nigga, I don't care about the Benz
Plus I had a lot of chicks, you can have those bitches
But I murder your bloodclot if you touch my riches
Yeah crazy ass skipper, I be in the slums, nigga
Fuck where I come from I'm a quiet gangster nigga
First I get you comfortable, then I start shanking niggas
Park Hill code is don't violate the family
Brother to brother it's no snakes in the amnesty
I come through wilding on some Wu-Tang 'Can It Be'
Googly-eyed nigga, chop his face in the ministry
Never scared to do the time, fuck the penitentiary
Leave a bunch of dead niggas, don't forget to mention me
The angel of rap, the un-ordinary light
Already did what I was gonna do before you even got the mic


We left a large solar cloud distinguished by size
Interaction with the wise and civilized
The mind caused matter to fall into a center
A great deal of heat that'll radiate within ya
From out of this collision
The central cord became thick enough to trap its own light and bring vision
Each drop full of Hip Hop energy
Balanced on all sides such great symmetry
The bars unlocked the power of the stars
The mirror in the telescope pinpoint the Gods
From a distance, acting as a guiding coach
Analyze the board, universal approach
Retune the soul to a certain pitch
Changing the frequency frequently, hitting a certain switch
The love is paramount, the connect is brotherly
Respect for the intellect and broad discovery


Keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
Keeping the streets locked
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
Keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
Run these streets out here don't need cops
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block




Yo Meth, hold up, hold up
Yo Meth, where my Killer tape at, God?
First of all, where my... where the fuck is my tape at?


Yo son, I ain't got that piece, son


How you ain't got my shit when I let you hold it, man?


Yo, niggas came over to have 40s and blunts, kid
The shit just came up missing, son


Come on, man, that don't got nothing to do with my shit, man
Come on, man, go head with that shit, man


Come on, man, I'll buy you four more fucking Killer tapes, man


(banging on the door) A-yo! A-yo!


Open the door man, what the fuck, man?
Yo, what? What's up?


Yo, yo God, word is bond, yo
Shameek just got bust in his head two times, God!


Word to mother!


Word life, God. You know Shameek from fucking 212, God?
The nigga just got bucked
Niggas in a black Land, God, word is bond
Came through, God, from out of nowhere, God
Word is bond I'm coming to get my Culture Cipher, God
And they just... word is bond, crazy shots just went the fuck off, God


Niggas let off crazy shots, kid


The nigga laying there like a fucking newborn fucking baby, God


Word up!


Is he dead?


Is he fucking dead? What the fuck you mean is he fucking dead, God?


What the fuck kind of question is that, B? Fuck you think?


The nigga laying there with his fucking...
All types of fucking blood coming out of his fucking...


(sarcastically) Is he is he is he dead?


Yo God, what's up God? It's the God, God, word is bond
Yo what's up I'm ready to fucking lay...
I'm ready to get busy, God, what's up?


Yo let's go do what we got...

Yo let's go do what we gotta do, man, fuck it


Yo, we out or what, man?


It's the God, God, fuck that, man


You saying we out?


They probably took the tape


What the fuck?


Nigga still sweating the tape, man


What the fuck is you talking about? Get the fuck outta here


Fucking corn




They told me, what happened, alright
You're still young, and things like that always happen
When you'll learn, then you'll know not to make those mistakes


Really? These dudes don't want it with Deck, no, my set glow
Hate it or you love it, but you gonna respect though
You ain't got to know my name, check the blood, sweat & tears
For years, niggas know I bang
I'm a made nigga, caking what you call a boss
On my own two, never taking orders from ya'll
What I spit, get the corners involved, it's wreck on the yard
It's House Gang, son, it's more than hard
The life that'll glamour and glitz, best believe
On the flip side, nigga, it's them hammers and clips
Wanna live in high fashion and rich, so we scramble the strip
Camouflage, with they hand on the grip
Ain't nothing gon' stop kid from getting his due
No, your feets not big enough to fit in his shoe
I don't rock what you rap, niggas, they be pole
On 'The Wire,' just not HBO
They under fire, edge around the way we know
They know they time up, guess that's why they hate me so
But yo, they will never take me though, I had to go like
Montana, licking, sniffing crazy blow
Still I be Hard to Kill like Seagal
Warrior built, big shield and long sword
One Six Ooh'ing it, doing it, king size
Salutations, that's respecting the king eyes
For those that follow my lead, attract to the light
At the same time, marvel the speed
I'm so dope, I can bottle it free
The most influential, modern day murderous he


Yo, deep in the bungalo, chopping the motherload
Carving my own path, taking another road
I need a son to soul, he brought the troops with him
It sounds presidential, I got the truth serum
Don't want the booth near him, respect in the sabotage
I'm on the patio, stretched in my camouflage
And my grammar's hard, the Wolverine skeleton
I be the yellow man, snatching on the other brand
But on the other hand, light up the darkness
I'm stir fried, nigga, yeah, I'm heartless
My apartment is a hole in the wall, nigga
Pass me the rock, stop holding the ball
I told you before, under worser conditions
Chessboxing, nigga, mic's a dead body position


Aiyo, it's time to make cash dinero
I'm going to the Summer Jam concert to bash your hero
Lie up in your bedroom, smash your bureu
We looking for the money, man, pass the Euro
Apartment to pesos, pass the yen
And, we don't want to have to ask again
Cuz we ain't gon' be laughing then
These three men, take on your whole staff and win
Look, labels stay messing with a cat's future
And that weighs on me heavy like Rasputia
But I still keep spitting like a shortshop
I'mma be sitting at the table when the cork pop
You gon' be sitting at the table with a porkchop
Lacking on the beat like a short cop
It's your boy Ace, BK's own
All you ringtone rap dudes, please stay home, come on




Suga, come here, ayo man, tell ya man
He better bring that fucking money here tomorrow, man
You, walk up in the joint with me, man
It's all real, yo, what up son?
Yo, hold the bottle, it's your night, nigga!
It's your night!
Yeah, mad bottles! Playboy! We out of here, man
(Step inside, kiss the ring --- so salute, and toast to the best who done it)
{Give it up for the Wu-Tang Clan!}


When I step inside, kiss the ring, Wu Familia
La Cosa Nostra, it's our thing
So salute, and toast to the best who done it
Murder rap shit, I spit, for the vets who love it


By the time you read this letter
Your head gon' fly off your shoulder for lying
And I'mma be in bed like holders
Blood from a horse on your spread, you tried to play me now
I'm coughing up, dough on your head, you just a baby
See me in the flick in Zurich, I had to maybe with me
All these niggas stay in the 90's, getting rich
Rick Ruler robe on with rings, walking to the throne
Fronting like I know I'm the king, I live alone though
Buying up, China's Beemers, taking it to Simon's in Medina
Only just to blind you and leave ya
These young boys is crafted with aim, I bought 'em all
Fly ranches, cuz they all stand beside me with flames
Regardless, yo, to making the classic
You gon' witness some of the tactics
Some died, live in the action
A live general when he walk, if he died, then we slide
Ninety thou' in the coffin, and take the child


When I step inside, kiss the ring, Wu Familia
La Cosa Nostra, it's our thing
So salute, and toast to the best who done it
Murder rap shit, I spit, for the vets who love it


Black Jesus, check my walk, check my talk
Legend in the flesh and I rep New York
Crowned king, been down to bang, I'm House Gang
Knockout specialist, in and out the ring
Got dinner tables long as boats with old kitchens
And Wu-Tang logos splashed on all the dishes
You know how I speaks the truth, how I teach the youth
I'm an animal, I beast the booth
Been grinding, banging out for food to eat
Your boy still eating good, check my new physique
Since the world is mine, I'mma write my name on the clouds
So that ol' yee faithful, can praise it and bow


Now he's an old Mafia don, from back when
He managed to survive the game, ducking fame
It's how he maintained, the State of Grace, kept his lab laced
Ladies of a fine taste, kept his place guarded
While the young charted, found acquitted, all charges
And his heart loss and, marksmen take the contract
From the contact, waiting for the right event, it all made sense
He left no prints on the weapon, and he was blasting
Came home from prison stashing, still stacking
His whip still matching his kit, steel flashing
Hands quick, nice with his shit, three holy foods drops jewels
From a street corner level, young brother, I'mma rebel
Here to instruct private soldiers to buck arms
Ya'll rap cats had your last win, toast the kings
It's Wu-Tang, it's our thing, kiss the ring


When I step inside, kiss the ring, Wu Familia
La Cosa Nostra, it's our thing
So salute, and toast to the best who done it
Murder rap shit, I spit, for the vets who love it




Ghostface: Let me - let me hold that

{*gunshots*}
Raekwon: ... you know trust this
Ghostface: Alright, scrungy-head motherfuckers


Lay on the crime scene, sipping fine wines, pulling nines on
UFOs taking they fly clothes, they eyes closed
We getting loot, no doubt, check the word of mouth
Unheard about, guns go off, and now I murder route
I'm out, my raps play the part, like a Get Smart secret agent
In a maze and style's blazing
Johnny Blaze and Tony Starks in a daze and
And Rhyming, my nigga Lou Diamond with Robert F
We like Meth to go and fuck with Noodles
Having them poodles on the lockdown, buying me
Amarettos and chewables, smacking pharmecuetical
Rap niggas on dust and woos
Yo, I told you, some killed, robbed and fold
The goal's untold, fuck it, it beats parole
So stroll marvelous, soul controller of the whole globe
Goddamn I got it sewn and yo
What up wop? Pop the suitcase high and we can talk
You can walk out the fucking building and get caught
Save the fully inflatable, rap relatable
Drug relatable, niggas here to play with you
A hundred dollar Rottweiler, go to spot sellers
Guns and Glocks for them niggas who got props
Off top jail niggas get mad bigger and yo
Mail a guy about a hundred pictures
Word to mama, this rap wonder rhymer team got drama
Comma, blunt smoke real ass marijuana
Chef Maranzano boats across the Verrazano
Immaculate, bust off my gun's so accurate
And get cream in the cuisine of Queens
I told you Money skated with night beams and two rings


Crazy fag, I'm getting ready to do this shit
(Sniff mad shit)
Man, niggas know not to step on this shit


Who's the knucklehead, wanting respect?
Chop his fingers in the drug game, Money well known
Lead singer, humdinger, flash is the aftermath, here's his photograph
Run up in his lab, take off the mask Chas and think fast
Don't laugh, bag the cash, grab the hash, don't forget his stash
Grab the tear gas and place it in his face fast
At full blast {*Car zooming by*}
Then skate to the next gate further upstate
I heard they got crazy weight, bagged up by the cakes in
Crates like disco breaks, yo look out for Jakes
Give it all it takes, let's burn the place before we motivate
Yo, Blake, niggas don't fake, rape his mate
If the bitch scream, for God's sake grab the grey tape
It's by the plate with the blow crushed up with the flakes
Killer snakes, four bodies found floating in lakes
Drug related paper talking about the kids who didn't make it
Hits without a trace, never seen the bricks, see Rae and Ghostface
Congratulations Chef, let's celebrate and sniff an eighth

{*Inaudible conversation*}


The rap star is born
Rap Parmesan, put it on, seal it on
We're silicone, spark it on your talkathon
This rap phenomenon, two corresponds
Took the arms, hit me on the hip and horns, rap chaperone
Scars tone, bars thrown, war tones, raw tones
Blowing out the door, bones, but
Your raps is fraudulent, plug in these rap coordinates
Is reinforced with suspense, be on your rap sword defense
These microphone professional, sensational
Fully operational, I got niggas here to play with you
You know the steez, you know my whole program
Brothers from the no-lands, all we want is the Gs, guns and grams
Living fat like the Hoffa, mafia, sipping, eating pastas
Laying in the house telling the seeds about the sagas
Before we got dramatic and thoughts got sporadic
We grabbed golden tablets and quick guarded the Abbots
Slugs hit the Pelle, put tokes into the belly
Suckers tried to knock me out the box like Skelly
I smoke the weed trees, I drop top to the breeze
Honey dip spending G's on nails and hair weave
The crime boss, taking no loss, excessive force
We can play the A-Train back of the iron horse


Raekwon: Yo, man, you know what I'm saying?
Ghostface: Fuck it man

{*Tire screech*}
{*crash*}



Your kung fu is good!
Your magic is good
That's why he waited!
My power had diminished
So he'll have to kill me
Yes, but...

Your kung fu is still good
If you practice again

Fierce, I travel across seas on glaciers
4 shoguns that got fucked by geishas
Still gracious, still able to twist out darts
Just screw up your skin for swimming
With the sharks. Broken ankle
Fucking with the wallabee clarks
Got them bitches still screaming my name
"Waddup Starks?" I'm a bone-crusher
Ox'll split your face like a Dutch Master
No more mixes - polar bears from Alaska
With sharkskin Air Max's and igloos of ice
Rocks clumped up like overcooked rice
I'm nice, you the reason why the game went soft
Playing niggas, I come through and season your broth
Like Mr. Dash, I blast, I'm a Menace like Dennis
Young Ghost, in the bathroom a 6-month sentence
Rehabilitated, back in the yard, flying heads
With barbed wires, stay tying niggas to beds

Everybody get paid
Everybody get laid
All these bitches dirty
Everybody got AIDS
Everybody get played
Everybody get sprayed
Everybody do what I say
Everybody my maid
P - crack-selling black felon
That clap "rat tat tat tat tat" melons
Some thugs - one gun, one slug
Shot-caller, like "yo let me speak to young Mugs"
Listen, it's Mandela, pa
I grab wack emcees, I smack em hella-hard
I kill niggas with the birdy blick banger
My Wu-Tang niggas call me the 36th Chamber
"Lyrical miracle spiritual" rap dudes
Get smacked off their skateboard for not paying rap dues
P - call me the gatekeeper
Break heaters on your face, smoking laced cheeba

She want a thug, not the lawyer-type
A golden boy employed to promote and write
Sort of like an ill De La Hoya fight
I'm eating good, enjoying life
Flawless ice, with the bag of flawless white
With no strings attached, pull this might
Toy with my S550 with the raw pipe
Peeling off like snakeskin
Watch the cobra bite
Overnight success story
Going jet for me, you rep ?
That's why your cassette's corny
Your money too short for long convo
You in the game hurting, tryna play
Rajon Rondo. Millionaire swag
Peep your boys ensemble
Jewels heavy, Prince Akeem, coming to America, et cetera
Whoever said the kite is a messenger
Cause I think like the man behind a register
Quick to pull the toaster out
Stomp, choke em out. We over here
Counting Bread, what you loaf about?

You finished already? Get up and fight
Hey, let's get some strength
Let him go til he outlive me
Let's say he killed my cult, let's go




Here we are..
Bobby, I was just wondering, you know
About me and you, tonight
If we could go do a little Rhumba
Dance, you just think about it and let me know


Esta bueno, porque esta es La Rhumba
Ven bailar conmigo en esta Rhumba
Esta bueno, porque esta es La Rhumba
Ven bailar conmigo esta Rhumba


Rhumba? What's Rhumba?
I'm sayin' though, what?
I'm sayin'..

Yo, what up Butter Pec'? Girl, you got me shy to speak
You the same dime piece that I saw last week
On the dancefloor, yo, the way you glide
Make a club of thugs do the Electric Slide
Pretty in pink, come here, let me buy you a drink
Armaretta sour orders put us both in sync'
My name is Bobby and I don't usually dance that much
I play the wall, but girl, you got that magic touch
That lured me in like a fly into the spider's web
Not these everyday hoes sweatin' ghetto celebs
Power Rule, I heard you got the good Power-U
Let's slip to my crib for an hour or two




Hey, hey, hey..
Uh, uh, uh, uh..
Eh eh eh eh eh..

Hey Butter Pecan what's that lingo you speakin'?
It sound like, let's me and you slide for the weekend (True)
I got drinks and tasty treats to sink your teeth in
Your popi two-way beepin', let him know that you cheatin'
Runnin' 'round indecent exposed without no clothes
There it go (*plug*), Moby Dick and there she blows
You got me covered, girl, and it shows and I suppose
We can play doctor soon as I drop my Girbauds


I don't wanna dance baby girl, it's like my legs is on strike
Boogie that ass to the bar, snatch a Remi, no ice
I'm in the corner, we can vibe all night
Polite, I need a bag of that grass
To blast me out of sight like a satellite
Bigga what up? Yo, long time, good to see you
Look at shorty ass shakin' like the system in my vehicle
Clubbin', twenty deep, buggin', all types of funny freaks
Mouths wide shut, we let our love for the money speak




Yo
Open season, open fire, Beretta barbed wire
First platoon strike soon, scud-missile on the whistle
Up in the club with the pistol
This chick bumped into me like, "You big joint official?"
Indeed, so? Blow out your back, yo
She was like, "Yo, negro, negro"
Puffin' all that trash, you best to see so (so so)
So I introduced her nightcap, she was like, "I like that"
Later on tonight, you know, I gotta spit that
Flow and a half, blow at her back
I like it rough, and I hope she's rough back
She was like say her name
I was like, "Say mine back"
She was like, "Yo, daddy, daddy, daddy"
I love it like that, Beretta stay givin' it
Power-U so good, I just might have to jizz in it






I flip goods like a stock trader (Get money)
Theodore rush the floor we attack like Al Quaeda
Suicide missionary, black activist
Nice with the tongue, I'm a verbal type masochist
Hard body, my skin got teflon?
Dodge bullets, rock chains the size of?
Roll big blunts, a whole ounce of reefer
Rocked that "Black & Yellow" before Wiz Khalifa
It's a Killa Bee color scheme
I blow mega C. Are. E. A. M
I been Ghostface before Scream, know what I mean?
I'm like Billie Jean, lighting up the floor when I walk
This is Staten Island, New York
'87 cheeba hawk
No book, no? On the?
If you chick lose her? I'ma still get?
Rebel porn star, thick like dick Swellington
Beat the pussy up, eat it soft like gelatin


You know the M. O. Could never be in limbo
No lie I'd rather die for the poor folk info
Boss shit intro, horse dick nympho
Smoothe on the chicks like a Robin Thicke tempo
Imprint flow make your bottom bitch?
Soft cushioned insoles
Stroll on tracks in the back of the court
When they told on black
Blacks on blast got racks on rats
So no need to ask why he act all that
King Cognac, got a thing for them gats
I hate his offspring, I'm a fiend for the facts
Swing on the map, overseas with the G's
South Cadillac, tryna squeeze me some seeds
Breezed on them D's when they tailed on the bike
Around the same time I exhaled on the mic
The name az ring bells on sight


I take money like a pool shark
Put the ace in my right pocket
Hella cool dude and I won't hesitate to pop it
Still a rude dude, try to replicate my doctrine
Run with mad killas, my niggas regulate the projects
I'm hard bodied, I keep a John Gotti
You keep it Bon Jovi, you wear a thong probably
Nigga you fuckin' with a sick puppy
P's all up in this bitch, it's 'bout to get ugly


I could take you a hood
But you should already know
My affiliation of Wu contribute to the glow
I'm worldwide with it (for sho)
You better check or get laced up
From you face up and left
(Dog) We don't just do it, we do it to death
(Y'all) Better respect some shit
Or we'll ruin your rep (C'mon)
The realness that spit this Kill or be killed shit
It's still kill or be killed shit
I never concealed it



YoyoyoyoyoYO! Yo
Is the niggas ready for this son?
Niggas ain't ready for this ock
One two whatcha wanna do (I'm gonna give it to em anyway though man)
Peep the Inspectah Deck (You know they ain't ready for it)
Lyrical threat
Representing Wu-Tang
Slang, ninety-five
Hittin it live
You know what time it is

Blessed with the art rhymes that's sharp like a circular saw
Hit the floor like Dorf, who wants the war
None slide by my, lyrical driveby
Shots bust, making blocks huss
Plus snipe the cops when they rush
Built like construction tools
Crushing fools, in twos
Forced you to blast out your fuckin shoes
A South swap with the bombs I drop
Plan A to terrorize you can't stop the plot
Execution of an amateur, who dares to challenge a
Clansman, holding a sword like Excalibur
Truth is my shield, show and prove I reveal
Reality, the coldness a heart can feel
Livin life where caps peel, and crack deals from nine to five
But I survived through these live times I nearly died
Now I'm wanted by death I did escape
Now it's thrown on a tape for those who can relate
Still I wrap my face take a space in the staircase
Hits takin place, yo God, watch the Jakes
Out of state court dates, chase me with the warrants
For my insurance, switched names to Michael Lawrence
The Rebel, stomps through the slums I'm from
Coming through with nuff niggas, and nuff guns to bust son
So read the article, lyrical assassin with the arsenal
Potential witnesses are incapable
Of testifying, they want me frying in the chair
Plus the case closed, I broke free of the shackles, and safe clothes
I make foes, exasperate them, I make friends
Cause today's friends, show theyselves as snakes in the end
And if you fit the trend then Protect Ya Neck
Shaolin, INS, Killa Hill Projects

No one on this earth, can hold me
No one on this earth, can fool me
No one on this earth, can grip the mic
Like, I, do, nigga

You ever, feel, that you can
Test me, you got to face the Clan and
Never, return to the mic again
There's no one in the world

Let me at them! I blast off lyrics like a Magnum
Forty-four caliber, bustin mad holes in my challenger
Turning your trunk to swiss cheese
The wild freestyler, wild like Gene Wilder
Wu-Tang killa bee aimed at your brain
With my stinger, it stun your mind, when I bring ya
Thirty-six chambers of anger, frustration
For waiting, to let loose on the nation
Far from commercial no need for no rehearsal
Hit you from all angles then form a circle
Go against the grain, get hit close range
When I Slam, like Onyx, comp get stomped, that's a promise
I'll represent, here's the evidence
Science of math on a plate to make sense
My technique of speech is deep, like Leviathan
Hittin up your block with rhymes, weapon firing
Shooting for the platinum, then bring it back to
The same place I got the gat from, let me at them!




Someday I'm gonna be walkin down the streets
Mindin my own business.. and BAM!!
I'm gon' be shot by some pig who's gonna SWEAR
That it was a mistake
I accept that as a part of my destiny!

{*Si es mi destino morir en la calle como un perro! Hahaha*}


Whattup kid? That's right..
Yo.. aiyyo.. aiyyo..


Aiyyo let my niggas live
We show and prove get paper, catch me in the caper on shrooms yo

Let my niggas live
We giants, live off the land lions, post with iron, no pryin rules
Let my niggas live; aiyyo let my niggas live
Handle your bid and kill no kids


Millionaire feat, whole family eat; yo, y'all niggas is weak
Got a bird beak, chirp chirp speak
Kids that's rich that'll, run in your bitch and by the third week
Yo mark my word, me and my herb speak
That's that fire move like Schwinns yo
Invisible pens that write light, leave blends
Hit with the JF Kennedy shot
Smash with the Acapulco rifle got got
Bolt off, but got clocked
Legendary here, custom made it, shit bladed, word up
Design your alphabet, reps get graded
We in get-high saloons, big bag of shrooms, arm's length
Home of Allah's ten big rooms
So what we up in here, modelin large with rigorous moves
Exotic Gods bust my hammer at frauds
Call him a live merchant, dressed in all red, that's right y'all
Gucci jumper X-5, gettin more head




I scream at the mirror, curse, askin God, "Why me?"
Run in the black church, gun in my hand, y'all try me
I'm God-son, son of man, son of Marcus Garvey
Rastafari irie, Ha-ile Selassie
Police'll try to break us, but the streets raised us
It takes more than metal bars, we destined for ours
I hear murder plans from dopefiends, with elephant hands
Snots in they nostril, the blocks is hostile
There's no pots to piss in, Glocks is spittin
Rocks cookin underground bodies stiffin, cops look at bird shit
Drop on the window pane, the oxygen is cocaine
It drove lots of men to die with no name
I been on boats, nut down throats, pee on bitches who famous
Pretty dick, puttin stitches in they anus
I'm the animal that Hugh Heffner created
The only nigga Sade dated, the most hated, Nas nigga




Roughneck reppin the set, bang 'em twice in the neck
C.O. flip and jerk the whole yard rec
Block vets, pop barettas Glocks and tecs
You're no threat, gun talk, the language of the project
Checkin shorty with the +Black Tail+ stance, leapord pants
Yellin fuck her man, makin killings off her lap dance
Plus the young guns runnin the slums, funds is major
Drugged out, got you huntin for crumbs stuck to the razor
Semi-autos roar in the building hall
Symptoms of bloodsport, the slugs are still in wall
Call it a New York state of mind, gotta take mine
In the daytime, the Jakes'll hit ya forty-one times
So I live by the sword and obey hood laws
Make my team click like high heels on wood floors






Someday I'm gonna be walkin down the streets
Mindin my own business.. And bam!!
I'm gon' be shot by some pig who's gonna swear
That it was a mistake
I accept that as a part of my destiny!




Whattup kid? That's right..

 + (Raekwon)
(Yeah, yeah) Aiyo, how much more for a fifth of Vodka? (Peace beloved)
(Six bottles of Henny, six bottles of Henn) Word, word, let me get that
Herb, yeah, yeah.. (bring that bucket here)
Yeah (get some ice, man, two more bottles of Cru', man, word up)


I've gone through life pretending
That time will change the ending


Peace to the God (peace God) pour out a little liquor
Shame On A Nigga, I heard the reaper done came to get ya
So I done copped a fifth of, Vodka, and in your honor
I've grown this fetish for loose ladies and baby mommas
Some say it's bad karma, what you do, man, it come back on ya
Music got us up off them crack corners
Now I'mma swallow this whole bottle for Ol' Dirty
Damn, it hurts me, I hate it when brothers go early




Word to my son, he gon' remember you, rubbing on a statue
In his lab, that resemble you, and what it meant to Wu
Us forming like a family, you just blew
You was the chess piece on the board, that made us look true
Watching your pen swish, you love frying kingfish
You the pearl in the ocean, I'm up on the land, pissed
Now you moving more prestigious, me, hitting this reefer
I know it's real, guess I slept with the Black Jesus




I became weak when I heard, that his body expired
It was hard for me to believe my brother retired
Suddenly the clock stopped and the room started spinning
How can he walk off the field during the first inning?
I cried like a baby on the way to his place of death
Hate not being there, the minutes before he left
Now I'm in the booth, ten feet from where he lay dead
I think about him on this song and what he might've said




When I first heard the word, I needed air to clear my head
I know you didn't say what I thought you said, my brother's dead
You crazy, another Dirty prank to get the family cranked
Ya'll niggas shouldn't play like that, I know how you feel
Lord, but it's real, and I still can't believe
And my heart still grieves the loss, there's no pretending
Ason Unique, loved wine and fine women
We singing on tour, "ooh baby, we like it raw"




Can't pretend...
Some day it gotta come to an end
But I'mma keep you right here dog, real close to my heart
Yeah...


I popped a bottle on your born day, God
Tried hard not to cry, I still can't hide the scar
And I still ask, why to God, analyzing your form
As I stood there beside your mom
And I share the blame, cuz you was calling for help, kid
Should've, would've, could've, had the time, I was selfish
I carry on your struggle, each day it really hurts me
I really miss you Russell, hope you forgive me Dirty




Yo, these walls I wanna crash, and put my fists through
Shout out to Dirty, let the whole world miss you
Reach out and kiss you in your coffin, my heart races
I dropped tears and watch my nigga fall from greatness
It's all wasted, flushed down the drain and
Soon as the news hit me, I bust out with pain and
Rivers I cried, my brother just died
I'mma see you, my nigga, on the other side




Ah, man, how do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones that have to die
It's hard to live without you, God, I shouldn't have doubted you
When you said that The Passion of Christ was all about you
From the God Mobile, to Linden Plaza, to Brownsville
Florida to Ohio, to Putnam, to Park Hill
You interrupt the Grammy's said "Wu for the kids"
Took four or five shots when they rushed in the crib
Trey-five-seven cracked ya ribs, cops shot ya whip
You've been chased by the pigs, sold the four year bid
Crashed cars, still came out without a scar
They tried to keep ya free spirit trapped in a jar
So you'll keep ya mouth shut, and not tell the world
Who's who and what's what, and probably go nuts
How we treat them hoes? Dirt, how we treat them hoes?
We fuck 'em in the butt, Dirt




But those mistakes behind me
Cast shadows to remind me

*gong bangs*
*Sifu Shi Yin Ming reciting the Heart Sutra*



When I was little, my father was famous
He was the greatest samurai in the empire
And he was the Shogun's decapitator
He cut off the heads of a hundred and thirty-one lords
It was a bad time for the empire
The Shogun just stayed inside his castle and he never came out
People said his brain was infected by devils
My father would come home he would forget about the killings
He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him
Maybe that was the problem
Then, one night, the Shogun sent his Ninja spies to our house
They were supposed to kill my father, but they didn't
That was the night everything changed
See, sometimes, you gotta flash 'em back
See niggas don't know where this shit started
Y'all know where it came from
I'm sayin' we gonna take y'all back to the swords, we bounce, yo
When the MC's came
To live our their name and to perform
Some had, to snort cocaine to act insane
With before Pete Rocked it on, now gone
That the mental plane to spark the brain
With the building to be born
Yo, RZA flip the track with the what to guy
Check 'em check chicka icka etta, uhh
Fake niggas get blitzed
And mic bites I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe
On some loud howl shit, to insert a fiend
But it was yo ock, the shop stolen heart
Catch a swollen heart from not rollin' smart
I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played, like Zodiac signs on Sweatshirt
That's minimum and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
'Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance is if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my clan in da front want it
When the MC's came
To live our their name and to perform
Some had, to snort cocaine to act insane
With before Pete Rocked it on, now gone
That the mental plane to spark the brain
With the building to be born
Yo, RZA flip the track with the what to guy
Check 'em check chicka icka etta, uhh
I'm on a Mission, that niggas say is Impossible
But when I swing my swords they all choppable
I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
Child educator, plus head amputator
'Cause niggas styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers
Lyrics are weak, like clock radio speakers
Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, hit the rail, like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
Round the clock, that state pen time check it
With the pens I be stickin' but you can't stick to crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Into the chamber and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels
Niggas are fascinated how the shit begin
Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin
When the MC's came
To live our their name and to perform
Some had, to snort cocaine to act insane
With before Pete Rocked it on, now gone
That the mental plane to spark the brain
With the building to be born
Yo, RZA flip the track with the what to guy
Check 'em check chicka icka etta, uhh



  Yo, you know what I mean? Chillin within
 Word up, niggas is stupid
 Look out for the cops man, look out for the cops
 Yo it was on last year Son
 Huh? Fuck

Niggas
 Niggas want two hundred grand over the table
 Like this
 That shit looks pretty
 Yo

 Yo G, the Mexican niggas is definitely buggin the fuck

 UP AGAINST THE FUCKIN WALL!!!
 The fuckin bitch? Get that bitch!
 Slap fire out!
 Oh no no no no no no no
 Get your shit right
 Get what?
 We gonna swerve on these niggas one time that's my word
{*music fades in*}
"What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility"
 That's comin from Louis Rich
 Baggin, you know what time it is, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo


Put them cracks down you just started slanging two months ago
What up with Larry Francisco tell him to let that bitch go
Why you standing there? Posing you like Donna Karan wear
Nigga save that, the same shit you had it last year
You be running with them outsiders
That shit is fucked up yo, we never turn to dick riders
Your Mac is big, got a little grip, yo
You think that shit gon live what he did -- what this nigga said
Remember when his mans got there, the whole shit was set up
Shut up, whole fam want the science and the letter
It got back to me some niggas in Medina askin me
"You know some niggas in the gold E-Class," splash to me
Yo that shit you had in Vegas
Yo, it could have got us both sprayed up
They seen the Ac, noticed Jada
Hair salon, treating shorty like Quran
Her fam major swing kingpins you won't dare front on
Octavia with all the ice on, yo
She own a car wash now, her little Keon doing triple life
Marry a Son who got baked, it coulda been
For a half a cake, play the shank, maybe bite her
Shit is fucked up when they got us yo
She fainted at her baby wake now watch the breakdown
"..face responsibility"
She fainted at her baby wake now yo watch the breakdown

"Little ghetto boy, playing in the ghetto street"


Yo all of y'all niggas got the whole story wrong
Talk what you talk but twist the real song
When it comes down to this, not a licensed driver
Show y'all niggas whose style is more liver
This is not a act this is more actual fact
Nothing but experience placed upon track
With the true sound, not lying out the crown
When we not working we hardly be around
Yeah see the light, right now we could fight
You not a real brother you just a fake type
That get on the mic then throw your clich
Half the East coast sounding just like Rae
If you a Gambino, give credit to the flow
If you not a part of this kid act like you know
Fuck the studio, Cappaccino the great
Fly cherry head niggas like planes out of state
I ain't friends with you, only my CD hit you
If you want some then stop fronting is the issue
It's my turn, live niggas could pass
Two-faced rappers push they shit last
Straight off the edge into the rubbish
Peep my new style fuck Cristal and Moet
I drink Evian water while my darts get published

"What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"

"Little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto streets
What you gonna do when you grow up..."

"What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"

"Little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto streets
What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"

{*35 seconds of instrumental pass until the martial arts samples*}

One is invulnerable, in fact
It involves strenuous breath control
Out of all techniques, it's the most difficult
The human body has a hundred and eight pressure points
Thirty-six of these can be fatal
The remainder, paralyzing




(What is that?)
The way of the true samurai
Is the ability to live through death



In progress...




(You my Dirty whore, you that Dirty whore)
What else you gonna do to it
But bust it, bust it though baby, bust it
Who else, who else is gonna do it
This is dedicated to all you bitches


Knew this bitch named Trash, she had a hella fine ass
Can't ask, blew my hope in the past
Niggarette gave me gonorrhoea
Pussy dick to the tippy toe like ballerina
Boy you should have seen her
She had a baby face creamer Purinas, called up talking Tina
I put my dick in her womb
She blew my head like a balloon, I had her walking on the Moon


I seen you at the five and dime wasting your time
Oh you shine, I'm looking at your ass from behind
You walked by smelling like watermelon
You might make me a felon, my eyeballs swelling
My nuts start yelling, excuse my prick
Wanna have a talk with you, I'm sick
My medicine is can I walk with you
Fantasy, after that we can cheat
Laid on the bed, handcuffed with hard meat Long stroke smacking, smack it then broke
Nothing can't stop my continuous poke
Compound, porno flick music
Daddy came with it when I wrote it


Dirt Dog be bouncing on bitches like fog
I pollute the air up like smog, bitch
I'm up my jacuzzi, peeping this smoothie
My bitch is a floozy
Dirt Dog ain't choosy, pussy move me
Pretty black dick up in the booty, I like it muddy and swampy
By now you find your ass up shitty creeky
Don't got no fucking room me and my momma in my teepee
Blackberry squeeze, bitch you a tease
Titties small, I got used to the squeeze
Fuck that shit, I'm through with this bitch
Old hen please can't get a bank of these welfare cheese
Now to blow fifty G's overseas
I'm doing the breeze, in my 850


Suicidal, she been in more hotels than bibles
Idol worshipping bitch wasn't the type to make bridle
Strung on how the bitch manoeuvred her tongue
From the top of his dick to the bottom of his ass split
I told the God to jet quick, this wicked bitch was a harlot
But had him trapped up inside the Charlotte Web
She wasn't choosy, fucked for a movie and a loose leaf cigarette
Pussy stay wet and juicy like lemons, big ass in tight denim
Had the most faithful niggas sinning against their women
And enjoyed to watch relationships get destroyed
This unemployed welfare bitch was non-void
And shameless, her attitude was blameless
Even though she had a hundred dicks on her name list
Her obsession caused niggas to get the ass cheek injection
The bitched lied, said she had Urinary Tract Infection
I tried to warn 'em and bomb 'em, but she conned em
Wanted niggas to fuck her raw dog without no condom

*woman moans* oooooh, ahahhh, ohh


You people are all trying to achieve the impossible
That's exactly what we've done
But you'll fail and you'll all die
If we die, the next generation will fight them too
And the one after them for as long as they must
And eventually we shall succeed




(Aiyo, Chef?) What up, my nigga?
(Yeah, man, I gotta give you the 411, shit is straight 911, word)
It's $2.50, nigga, back the fuck up! Talk to me...
(Word, them blue ninjas is everywhere
Word, watch ya back, Protect Ya Neck and all that shit, man
Thirty nine motherfuckers already got scooped up
Indicted, word, I'm bird eye viewing it right now
Out there out the motherfucking window)
You got the strong scoopers out there?
(Word, five book store buses out front
All them young boys are certified, they ain't rentals)


Run these mean streets from Cali to New York
Who could ya trust? Niggas they do talk
Running from the feds and out of state troopers
Look up ahead, you know we got sharp shooters


The blocks is molded, step up ya sword piece
Moving through them housing with more ki's
Rembrandts is fresh from Scotland, crisp hats, Cristal bottles
Niggas want the problems, we back
It's time to take over the game, it's nothing
I live on the line, from corner to castles with pawns and capsules
Scramble and find, my money's up, I'm praying for war
I do this all the time, all the time, all the time
Faces of Doom, sling in the lobby
Swinging cooked raw, if you played the field you was not leaving
Fast-pacin' for CREAM chasing team
Trying to come through the hood and lie, get left for dead naked in Queens
Let them other niggas wear that, we take the credit
While we was shopping for more Nikes and off-whites
Heroin stirrers, the crib, cracked mirrors
Career thugs who serve only judges and jurors
Got to make my money this year, whether it's through rhyming or criming
I'll be on the line with my iron
Promised them llamas'll fly fast, quick at pirahnas
Trying to intervene, get caught dead, no head in pajamas
You live like a slouch from vouchers
Nobody mad, you was a fake, dead, die with no trousers
Cause you crossed the line like Miller's Crossing
Off with ya dome, I walked you through the woods, we both smoked a bone




Mean streets...
Just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in
The streets stay flooded with crack rocks and Mac shots
The scenery's money, guerrillas in the back drop
The livest'll pop, the weakest get chopped where they stand
Singing the judge's name, dropped in the stand
Drug money kills, blood on my bills, mud on my Nikes
Only buying with the couple that I trust with my life
Twenty four sev' ducking the feds, infrared wtih lead
Gamble with off track betting instead
In my hood anybody can get it, and everybody want it
Cutthroat executives, the corners, the office
And the thought is to be boss of all bosses
The cost is ya life, swimming with sharks and orcas
So keep ya guards up, or get scarred up
It's a Cold World, I told you with Allah Just'
The bigger the funds, the bigger the guns that's blazing
It's sick in the slums and niggas are stunting for nathin'


Aiyo, my gun been in more niggas mouths than a whore had dick
With creamy nuts on the side of her jaw
It's Rigatone, nigga, sliding through airports
Riding on niggas like MJ, same day I rocked you, comprende?
Yeah, I'm kinda off cuz my guns was dirty
That last joint that hit you, kid, you made the top thirty
Early, walk with me and strap with a vengeance
More or less Ghostface Killah'll stretch you out like mad words in a sentence
Smell the gas burning (yeah) feel the fire (word)
Real talk, it's not that bullshit from The Wire
It's them disco kids that clap iron
Champion hoods, if ya coke don't freeze, my face is not worth frying
We crack eightballs with pool sticks
Bungee jump off a mountain of bricks
Fuck you up if you slinging those nicks
Toney Starks from the octagon, my ox is on
Snap Matt Hughes' neck with my boxers on






Back with another one, this hip hop shit ain't over
The Wu brought it back I told you
Chef shit is hard
The hip hop critics is dick heads, they'd rather see Shallah in the yard
Writing rhymes that's soft as cotton
We can never ever see that, the nigga flow grows is poppin'
First verse I'll be ready to get clowns
Catch 'em in hallways, the worst look get laid down
And yo, I rhyme for shooters and boosters
Get money churchmen, all those respect my Wu shit
Regardless if you see me on TV
In 3D and HD, I'mma stay safe in Rae beats
This time I'm a bastard swordsman
Who put in that work, real quick then I'm repping to Boston
Don't try to get in my way
Any rapper any herb I'mma blow you like herbs and lick


Fuck a cell phone plan, with a ring I get a hundred dollars
Five dubs in a whip on my way to holler
Yeah I do credits, but not the ones you get in college
My niggas can't afford Benzes, so we rip impalas
Tints on the windows, lookin' like the Ds
Got the dope boys nervous when they see me in the street
Fuck the hollering on wax, you can see me if it's beef
Hollywood will load the gat and put the BBs in his fleece
I'm a preacher with the piece
I used to sell X on the west coast, now I get it cheaper on the east
I've been around the world like Lisa Stansbury
TV with the goosenecks, goosenecks to the cranberry
Got the Clan ready with the 10 Chevy, keep my grams heavy
Slap a bitch ass, doggy style, like my hand's heavy
G up in my swag, tough talk'll get your man buried
Blow the last dragon, part two, nigga, fists of fury


I could care less if you're well know shooters
100 guns, 100 clips, but you still can't move
It's been a while since you heard a nice nigga from BK
Representin' the village, known for lettin' this heat spray
First grip we flipped took like a weekend, 3 days
Whole team runnin' 'round the Ps with AKs
9 different types of drugs, slipping 'em 5 ways
Gettin' rid of a brick in less than five days
I pop your head off, leave your brains on the sidewalk
My 40 cal, a rearrange to your sidetalk?
Where I go, my team, they gonna follow
Top Model hoes, with no game, they gonna swallow
Got a lotta foes, that's why my aim be on hollow
Die before I let you violate, nigga, live by the motto
Pimpin' through lanes, poppin' ?
At this rate, I'm gonna miss it, I might not witness tomorrow


You say you gangsta? Yeah I'm a gangsta
You pop that thang? yeah I pop that thang
Your clip on empty? My clip on empty
Your clique gon bang? Yeah my clique gon bang


Look, I hit a weed spot
Bypass niggas with broke guns and cheap shots
Outlastin' niggas with no punch, y'all eat cock
Get too cocky, the heat cock
You wanna walk a mile in my shoes, you need socks
You need not call out a G, cause he's not
They playin' with a pussy, I'ma show 'em the G spot
This dude's a Meth-head, I'll show him the detox
Look at Johnny with his old ass
I'm still schoolin' the whole class
The kids in the hall, you get no pass
Ice hit the eye like a cold flash
Niggas hopin' I don't spaz
Speak for the have-nots and don't-haves
Fuck it, I'm thorough nigga, fuck their worlds
Meth clutch the mic, bitch niggas clutch their pearls
Tonight, I ain't feelin' no ice stares
If you want it, I'm right here, Staten Island and we don't fight fair


As a young lil' homie, I used to sell crack
I used to run in the front of the building and come out the back
Lil homie on the block with the fly ass gear
Me and my crew used to shop around Union Square
Ay yo, I never knew I would become an MC
Now everybody on the block be amazed at me
Because I rock the mic most definitely
Throw darts and I get fly on you, you know my steez
Buy 25 high?, yo, I stay low key
And if I have to pop something, yo, it's not my fault
I ain't tell y'all niggas try to crack my vault
I'm the new terrorist rapper, the main assault
You ? on your back, elbow a nigga thought
Through Wu-Tang lyrical kung-fu
Death when you enter, all my nigga will hunt you
Peace to the gods
One, two, one, two


Million dollar voice box
It's your choice, Ox
The face Ox cut off
Like tank tops
My motivation is money and mass murdering
While you still provin' you nice in rap tournaments
I be all smooth with the ice and mad burners
And plottin' on takin' your life
Look how I lure them in
Get drunk, smoke ashes up out the urn again
Axe murderin' journalist for the words they writ
Mathematics crafted the beat, called Term to spit
Cause I set fire to shit like a furnace lit
I pack German clips, stash box in the whip
Four door Optimus Prime, Transformer shit
Call the coroner, caskets for half price
Bodies in the trunk, movin' through the Mass Pike
It's all now, cause in Law town
We roll with premature babies
We carry four pounds




I don't touch that swine
I want that unnecessary beef
You smoke garbage buds
We smoke tons of keef
Fishing, looking for that big-mouth bass
And flashing, jack your whole stash
In fashion, keep my goons lined
In an orderly fashion
It's glossy with 500 horsies in the Benz
Tinted out to spend the night
You ain't got angel funds is low, stack
Your bitch been ho-jacked
Still scoop her up, bring her home
And blow that, cause Ghost be mostly
Looking pretty toasty
Front row at Mayweather vs. Mosley
With a Bin Laden bottle
A Brazillian model
Got the paparazzi jumping
Like they hit the Lotto
Party hard, like I"m fresh
Out of the cages
I rages like Charlie Sheen, I'm vacant


You drop your pants at your ankles
At the urinal at a ballgame
I'm on the stool getting brain
From a tall dame, cause I'm 5'8"
Shorty like 6'2"
Feed her coke, locked jaw
Like a pitbull. I was born to rep
You fucking with a hornet's nest
Old shooters in the corner like ?
Young boys that be handling the rock
Chris Paul dish off, hammer in the sock
Gold flakes in the Gold Schlager
The ammo green XJ12, you know the old Jaguar
Got the burch wood lacing the interior
Poppy bagels getting flavored out in Syria
Only the Fonz, best laced plates
Cheese that reach maturity, dick sucks from Shannon Doherty
Take your temperature anally and orally
Make a batch of home drizzle royally with oil


Hopping out the Rolly Royce
Rolls Gold nouveau
Diamond-studded shoes, so
Flyest nigga you know
Puerto Rican version of Scarface
Fuck with the God's say
Disrespect, piss in your broad's face
Chains stay chunky like Oprah's belly
Got the purple and the brown:
Peanut butter and jelly
When I step up in the spot with the rock
You'll see the popular pop rappers
Go in their pocket and pull out their wallet
When I click-clack, now get up on the ground
Cause I Onyx, Pete Rock, Chuck D shut em down
You know Term, I'm the kid with the 'preme beats
Butter Pecan J Lo, kid with the mean cheeks
Boobies on my gold fronts, iced out note book
Making volcanos in the kitchen when the coke cook
I rode around with all kinds of thugs
High on drugs, pissing out tiger blood




 Yeahhh, torture, motherfucker, what?

What? I'll fuckin'  I'll fuckin' tie you to a fuckin' bedpost with your ass cheeks spread out and shit, right? Put a hanger on a fuckin' stove and let that shit sit there for like a half hour, take it off and stick it in your ass slow like *Tsssssss*
 Yeah, I'll fuckin'  yeah, I'll fuckin' lay your nuts on a fuckin' dresser, just your nuts layin' on a fuckin' dresser, and bang them shits with a spiked fuckin' bat
 Whassup? BLAOWW!!
 I'll fuckin'  I'll fuckin' pull your fuckin' tongue out your fuckin' mouth and stab the shit with a rusty screwdriver, BLAOWW!!
 I'll fuckin'  I'll fuckin  I'll fuckin' hang you by your fuckin' dick off a fuckin' twelve sto-story building out this motherfucker
 I'll fuckin'  I'll fuckin' sew your asshole closed, and keep feedin' you and feedin' you, and feedin' you, and feedin' you

Yo, roll the dice, yo, roll the dice
Yo, so it's goin' down like that, huh? Yeah?
Niggas is whylin', check it out, kid

Mover, puffing on a fat blunt from Cuba
It's the Meth-Tical jet to Cal, I'm the Buddha
Monk on the hunt for machine gun funk
I keeps you open like a slug from the shotgun punk
Double-barrel, yeah Meth bring it to them proper
Partner, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
Straight up, you moving too fast so baby wait up
Took one, added seven more now you eight up
Get on down with your bad self
Get on down, listen to the sound, come on
Few can ever get this whole commit legit
See you all up in my ass
But you don't know shit, uh-huh
What's your definition of a real emcee
From what you dedicated, hey it must be me
Meth-Tical, a rude descendant of the loud hip-hop
I go on to the break of dawn, and just don't stop
Give me the green light, and the sign one way
Have you had your meth today?
Huh, move it in, move it out
Stick it in, pull it out
Shake it up, shake it down
Come on down, Meth-Tical
Oh I hope and pray that I will
But today I am still
Just a...

Rrrappers can't get with the style, extra wicked
Rap flow is banging like butter on a biscuit
A-tisket a-tasket, I'm not trying to have it
Might show up, stun 'em and run 'em when they ragging
Those who test it, respect it, the method
You know I can't be messed with, I'm hectic, accept it
I'll break it down, I get down for my crown
Filthy, dirty like a worm underground
Trying to avoid the early bird, that's my word
Before I kick the bucket I'm a kick 'em to the curb
Check out the cloud, smoke out from the mouth
Other brothers got mad love new style for the hood, hey
Enter the square if you dare
Without a flaw, I'm so raw that I'm rare
I'm going to the country, I'm going to the fair
To see the senorita, with flowers in her hair
And get mine, cause she love me long time
Bartender bring more wine
Get in line for the...


M-E-T, H-O-D, Man
M-E-T, H-O-D, Man

Here I am, here I am, the Method Man


Wu-Tang, killer bees on the swarm, it ain't safe no more
P.L.O. Style. 1993 to '94, the rugged raw
And we out
(Sample from kung-fu movie)
It's a secret! Never teach the Wu-tang



 (x2)
If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome


The whole world trippin', listen it's still a cold world
The other day I had to bury my homegirl
Wrong place, caught one in her face
Plus her man's on the run and couldn't come to the wake
For Heaven's sake, you pray God open the gate
In this modern day Sodom, that's their only escape
10 year olds are cold, no, they don't hesitate
2 up a G pack, he chose the whole 8
Catch a 5 to 10 sellin' 5's and 10's
And the police informer was your childhood friend
In the real world, gotta hustle for your dream
Extend your clips, fit the muzzle with the beam
For the love of cream, it's nothin' but routine
Swing on the judge, take a couple for the team
He's the young Capone, he grew up in a drug home
Stranded on the Ave with a blunt and his gun shown


If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome


A live scene theme from a Godfather saga
A Martin Scorsese classic and I'm the author
Drama at the opera, crime story novel
Tuxedo suit and silencer on the nozzle
Meeting place scheduled at the Broadway musical
Bravo, we arrive in bulletproof limo
Shotgun, the underboss of our main source
Of interest, the black widow cocaine empress
A princess rich from her family's inheritance
Now let's talk business, begin by addressin' the bricks
That was missin' in the last shipment
At first, everything nice, everything routine
Jocks lining up the food, we blessed him with the cream
But on this day he wasn't ready and my God sense keen
I noticed that his normal firm handshake shook
It wasn't steady when he squeezed


If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome


He went from prince to a king out of a life of rubbish
Wearin' tailor-made suits, Sky Dwellers and clusters
To perfection, rags to riches, the evil's done influenced
That pushed him off the edge, they said the greed made him do it
You're my right hand, damn, he fucked the trust up
It's ruined, niggas caught him slidin' on his belly
I'm grippin' on my hammer with the silencer twisted
Contemplatin' murder now, I'm 'bout to swerve on my biscuit
But it's my man at the same time, I don't wanna do him
He violated, broke a major code, bar what you stealin' now
It's over, in the falls of Niagara, he was soakin'
With a shell case stuck in his head, they found him floatin'


If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome


Allah let me lay in your arms
Hold me like a newborn
Sing to me the most sweetest song
The exalted, the most benevolent
The knower of all
Keep me safe 'till I return back to your residence
This Earth, my place of birth
As time went through the ages it got worse
Sicknesses, beheadings in Syria
Ebola's killin' my people, it's gettin' scarier
Most foods ain't even real, the chip is here
Deadly fluids bein' released, contracted through air
Dear God, it been a minute since I cried out
Since mama died, I never wild out
We need help like the phone's 'bout to die out
Can you hear me? Can you hear me now?
We need a miracle
Destroy the FDA for holdin' back cures
So they can get paid


If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome




Miranda *speaking Spanish*
Yo, man, just let her live, man, stop playing, man
Oh, shit, B, where's Miranda? (She with Chef)


I dreamed it, Chef out in Cuba, a ruger
Thirty thou' on him, out in Mr. Chow, blew a cloud on him
Seen a Latin chick, laughing, clapping
Like your style, homey, tell your proud, hit the Crystal
Now we chatting, coebers and klickos, who do this a size six
She split up, had a brick, I peeped those
Her jeans was fitted, hair twisted, long as a fuck
She looked Indian, titties was plump
Had juicy lips, dimples, imprint on her pussy was mad thick
She grabbed my dick, hopped in the window
We in the Monte Carlo, bravo, uncle named Pablo
Gun connect, and he had his poke in Los Cabos
Good money, honey was strung, playing Luther in the background
Spanish version, my bunny was horny as fuck
Working the kid, we burst later, lay in the bed
Duvet sheets, my face hit the spread
Then time me, I'm not the kind of nigga, I was cool down at night
Drop my gun, shorty, my nigga
Body was sexy, "Lexy, come here, nigga, take off your drawers
Let me suck your dick, nigga, it's yours
Got real watery, Corey, damn you got good dick
You forty" spit on it, position your jaw
Call me 8-Ball, this pussy like China, climb the Great Wall
Then she came like volcanos in the late fall


Lady Miranda, she half black and white like a panda
I met her at the BET Awards, in Atlanta
Glamour girl, shopping in Bloomingdale's, skin pure
Keep a fresh manicure, hands with the cutest nails
Wall Street banker, hold accounts with Jewish now
Big businessmen, who own stocks in computer sales
Meanwhile, I'm checking her jeans out, imagining
Her fat bubble, riding my dick, making her scream out
She got a mean mouth, her lips is like soup coolers
Hotter than niggas riding around with six rugers
Miss Beaulah took a day off with a rich jeweler
When she came back she had a suitcase full of Fig Newtons
I met her at a villa in Vancouver, blowing her man's buddah
Bumping Mary J. and that Grand Puba
Check the 411, from a smooth operator
Got some pictures of her naked, I'll send them to Un later


Ay Dio mio, mamacita ass bonita
Remind me of the nights of Del Rio
I met at the Cotto fights, playing my seat though
That night, the linen was white, me and my hijos
Live from Puerto Rico, San Juan, where niggas sniff pedrico
Look at your man wrong, finito
Girl you know how we go, you getting my grown man on
Fuck with you primo, maybe I'm hands on
I'll massage your ego and be the love of your life
You know your people, a thug and his wife
Gave a look, she was touching my ice, so I looked at my dick
Like don't worry, we fucking tonight
She boricua, cinnamon skin, sign is Libra
She like wife beaters and men that like to eat her
Then I meet your feet up, meet me in room 112, light this reefer
You act right, and after tonight, I might keep ya




Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home


Yeah yeah they want me locked down, fryin' in jail
Before you hear that I decided to tell, I'd rather die in a cell
I was framed like a wedding flick, 2 time felon
Still a predicate, doin' time, tell 'em that's a negative
Prejudice judge, bails be a mil' in cash
Scorin' money like the meter on the Yellow Cab
Give the witness an unexpected visit
Make his story change like walls blockin' his vision
Couldn't give a clear description, fearin' the repercussions
Like, "I was on the ground, I ain't see him bustin'"
Now the DA chasin' a plea, they hatin' I'm free
The case is mistaken identity


Whoever push me like Pusha T, I push back
I push a cap, before '93, I pushed crack
I'm hood, black, you know me well, what's good, scrap?
I'm smokin' rappers, you are a L, what's good Smack?
Hold up that's Goodz rap, pardon self
I just like good rap, but when I see Goodz I give his goods back
I rap for writers that pack strap to rhymers that backpack
To 25 to lifers that jack MAC
We movin' ratchets, no Kat Stacks, it's magic
The way we flip the package before the coppers can catch it
I'm past that chapter in life, let's live it lavish
When life take a piss in your bed, you flip the mattress
Before you try and get my head, get you some Pampers
Then take a long look at my ish and get your answers
Kick in my vicinity, I'm what rappers pretend to be
Charge 'em with a penalty, mistaken identity


Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy


Fresh off of work, he jumped out the van
Two suitcases, dangle from his hands
He opened up the door, headed up the stairs
Thought he heard a noise, but no one else was there
First sight he saw, struck him by surprise
Two shots was given, between his girl's eyes
Windows blown out, no prints on the door
All he seen was blood stains, smear the damn floor
911, ambulance showed up
Blood everywhere, paramedics throwin' up
Cops cuffed him up, hit him with the charge
But he was bangin' Mrs. Prixy at the Motor Lodge
He got his alibis, gonna use 'em all
He screwfaced the judge, he might take the fall
Someone set him up, a botched robbery
Mistaken identity, yeah it gotta be


17 years old, I'm headed back to the hole
I'm mistaken identity, every way was sold
I look like a hoodlum, I rock a lot of gold
They lockin' everybody up, ship your ass up the road
I ain't have a 9 on me, they was lyin' on me
Court day with my old bird, they was spyin' on me
Tried to set me up, plantin' coke in my pocket
The beast pat me up, they won't let me off


Na-n-n-n-n-nah it wasn't me
It could never been the G-O-D, not me
You terribly mistaken, son, I ain't the one
We could never look nothin' like, whether near or far sight
What resemblance does he strike? So my mic Fahrenheit
W for my a-alike, your DNA match tight
Even if they bite us, close but not quite
They still tryna get it right, mistaken identity


Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy



Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
Wanna go home..
Wanna go home..
Wanna go home..
Wanna go home..


Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy




Yeah, yo, there's a dozen ways to die, six million ways to do it
Let's go through it, my mind flow like fluid
Torture, chop your legs up, thrown off the boat
Guillotine, nigga, one chop to the throat
Suffocation, saran wrapping your face
Buried alive, throw a few nails in the case
Manslaughter, eight degrees of separation
Leave your body chopped up in a piece, that's mutilation


Six million ways to die, cyanide in your drink
Catch a Cuban necktie for your mink
Dahmer style, cut up and stuffed in the fridge
And maybe washed up ashore and found under the bridge
Hit him with the whip, drag him half a block
Machete or the sock full of padlocks
Chainsaw, switch your medication
Stomp a nigga out til he one with the pavement


Torture, he's gruely peaking at the meeting
Suspicions of him being a rat? Even worse than cheating
I'm cold reaking of ice picks, scratch and sticks and closed fists
Brassknuckle steel toe kicks
Cracked ribs, punctured lungs, hard breathing
He's gasping and wheezing for air, his breath he can't catch
He clinches the shirt on his chest
In a dying effort to reveal his last will before he was killed


First things first, I chop your head to your fingertips
Butcher knife your torso, chop up your ligaments
Make sure it's legitimate, conceal all my fingerprints
Chop, chop your body up quick then get rid of it
A hole in the desert, body bag, just polluted it
Your miss was a snitch too? Shotgun killed the bitch
Leave her in the wilderness, suffocated and scarred up
Your brother want more too, blow his fucking car up


Another homocide city, murder mystery efficiently
Delete your fucking history broke bone, missing teeth
Throw bones, it's slippery, brings on the triple beam
All topped and chopped up, my luck is a Mr. Clean
Clorax and vicious steam sterilized the whole scene
Photograph your death so I can spread it to your whole team
Won't leave a trace of evidence for the case
It's sinister to finish it, hit with the man with no face


Red wine and pink veal
Unknowing that this would be his last meal
Comfortable hes made to feel, six inch stiletto heel
Kept his refills filled
Titties like big ass, kept him still for the real deal
Hitman from Brooklyn, Tommy gun specialist
Our one accomplice, sipped Courvoisier at the bar
Then waited till she lit a cigar
Then sprayed
In shattered wine glass he lay, he never saw it coming


Yo, murder one, bullets went fast through the flesh
I cocked the sawed off shotty, put a hole in your chest
Blow your lungs out, I've seen you been smoking for years
You got no heart, I'll hunt you down like Cape Fear
Push your brains out the back of your head, blow off your hands
Leave your body in a dumpster, head in the trashcan
Cell catching scene look clean as a whistle
Ghost carved through your skin tissue til the bone grizzle




Crack that pineapple open
Vision of break faces, gettin' money lay in the boats
Got big rifles, play the hood, ride Benz cycles
Y'all mens are psycho, Killah Hill 'ciples
More fly generics, money make moves, forget it
We got this locked since nineteen-seven
So many rods and weapons, ain't no more reppin's
Take the shit back, faggot, we hate that
Meet the real, we lock the real, me/him lock the steel
Pop off, pull out, drop them bills
I run with all real killas, all for realers
Nikes on, awesome gorillas
Want more then kill 'em, front war, reveal 'em
I want him stretched out, listen, he lost the buildin'
All fly gangstas, more bankers, hundred wit' us
We ex-dust niggas, don't even touch my drink
Fuck around, get shanked, stabbed, shot and broke
Ya' yolked and he blast-es through you in the faint
All my niggas get paint, yo what's my name?
Lexus Diamond, Ice Water Inc


Huh.. (uh-uh-uh-uh)
Uh! Yeah!
Once again in the motherfuckin' place
Fix yo' motherfuckin' face, nigga
Yeah.. you know how we gets down
Me and this mixo, we so.. we so tight
Lex Diamond sound, and uh
I bees the High Chief, Jamel Arief
Straight from East Medina
And uh.. yo.. yeah!
Yeah.. huh!


They started jammin' in the park, just after dark
Two turntables and their DJ scratchin'
Words seemed to have an attraction when they rhymin'
Hip-hop caused the guns to start sparkin'
Temperature risin'
Drape a nigga up with the ratchet, less talkin'
Caught him on the 'nard, bomb like a G. hard
Explosion rocks the Promenade, I'm God
And he show and provin', 'knowledge how he movin'
Smift as the wisdom, move from my gate in a drunken state
I wrote this degree, adjust ya eyes in the light so you could see
Never fall victim, dictate the fate
Leave the bake for the snake
If he take than I take his head without question
In the one to fourteen check the Justice lesson
Now uh!


Uh! It's the pineapple Daquiri fuckin' up ya mindstate
Ya heard? (Yeah) Spread the motherfuckin' word
Yo!


I'm from where it's real, niggas peal ya' orange
We want enough bricks that we could build apartments
I. General in the field of marksmen
The Bad Boys wit' me ain't Will or Martin
Feel what I'm droppin', I spit the ill doctrine
Spot him deep in the Killah Hill poppin'
Two feet dug in the dirt, up to the skirt
Spectator on the sideline lovin' the work
And my team ain't ya' average, CREAM we handle it
Fiends seekin' packages, beams and banana clips
Festo! If you wit' me, let's go!
The nymphos love me, X-O, X-O
Boy listen hard, think twice before you get involved
We hold the weight like cons in the prison yard
They call the riot squad, we live and in charge
Y'all non-beleivers get reminded with scars
It's the pineapple, Rebel I. natural
Fine wine hundred proof, spittin' mine at you
(CHUH-PUGH! Nigga!)




Brother, I think that necklace is causing you too much trouble


My necklace had the whole crowd on some next shit
The guest list full of real niggas that's hectic
The charm piece made my niggas move like calm beasts
Palm beats, two jostling niggas with long reach
Keep your eyes open for them strong on thieves
Out here looking for ice to put in they teeth
Chain glowing shining and I'm ready for beef
Like my nigga 2 Chainz, cappuccino from the east
From the Wu-Tang Clan, my necklace and my heat
Bang bang, different robe every day of the week
2 Angels, dinner plate, fat dollar sign
Universal flag on, nigga, I got shine




I keep my neck frozen, .45 loaded, please don't approach this
Rope is so ferocious, diamonds that shine in oceans
Keep you arm distant from my carats, silly rabbits
Make me get my barrel, spazzed out and cause havoc
Iced out Cubans, exotic stones from Africa
This the real thing, big bling, the chain swing
Try to swipe mines, that's a no no, the God's loco
Jewelry truckin' fancy spend stacks upon Delancey
Exhaust pipes coughing horse kicks
ACP's dress up the flesh, now the crime scene's gorgeous
My links is unbreakable, told y'all on the Purple Tape
40 inches hang from my neck, nigga, I'm wealthy




Why you say that?
It's real, kill a nigga for this shit
Aha, yo relax sis


Dinner plates rings, smothered in 2 pounds of dope
Eric B on the cut when it blings
Scrubbin' chain down in Colgate, double edged bangers
On they hips I wait in the jaw break
The snakes and the violators, Dracula style takers
We got a bunch of gold balls, but we ain't the Lakers
Hey bitches, stay lickin' my necklace
And I ain't even put the dumb bitch in the guest list
That's what you get when you throwin' on Cuban's
Drawers that's made from silk, a robe and a Ruger
Crack heads catchin' a sweet vix on a scooter
Catch me for my chain, it belongs on a shooter
Lucky my shit blow like a horn on a tuba
You might as well do me now cause I will do ya




God-Cipher-Love-Divine in math 79
Bright yellow and dense in its gift and shine
Still the same when exposed to air and water
Like when amongst thieves you  travellin' across the border
The brink of the metal link when in transition remains solid
The message was lost in transmission
That's often in a free elemental form
Nuggets and grains and rocks and things that's norm
Malleable ductile metal on many levels
Get you shot for a Flintstone, killed for a pebble
Lieutenants and Generals move with criminals
The pride for all in line, they hunt for mineral
The scope is on the rope, claws on the table
Brass knuckle, knees buckle, legs unstable
And it's sold by the weight
Shaped into a plate with food on it
The hungry wolves lie in wait




Tu Tin-To. So you're the tigers of Tinan, bastard, you're gonna pay for this, you'll die here. I'll use the tiger strike to kill you all. I'll show you the three different strokes. Forest Tiger! Win Tiger, Winmau Tiger!



Born with the struggle, used to hustle for crumbs
Fillin blunts in the building front, thuggin for ones
Full-clips fly, nicks, dimes, suckin the pump
Whole cliques fly, whips, dimes, nothing to son
City boy on the corner, I was so involved
So the drama I embraced, it would open arms
Tryna shake the pain, hoping I could break the chains
Everyday the same - who am I to make it change?
Real, my niggas risk it all just to play the game
And the young'uns going through it trying to play the same
Through the rain, through the fire, handcuffed by desire
Cynthia's son, forgive me for all the sins that I've done


My life, my pain lasts forever
Nothing in these streets makes it better
My life, my pain lasts forever
Nothing in these streets makes it better
So I live on..

Got a lot on my mind
As my life's shrinking and I'm caught in the times
It's a quarter to nine and I'm grabbing my nine
I had dreams, I just wanted to rhyme
Climb my ways out this wack-ass ghetto
I signed my name on the line with the Devil
Still in my prime ? to settle
Pots on the stove, old grandma's kettle
Late for my job - "he thinks he's a star!"
She hates her husband, he says I'm a slob
Mixed feelings, she ain't getting involved
Battle of the sexes, the planet off its axis
The IRS, god damn I owe these taxes!
The true verse, but I can take it
It's a long time coming, but I can make it
No mistaking, the CREAM is back..


My life, my pain lasts forever
Nothing in these streets makes it better
My life, my pain lasts forever
Nothing in these streets makes it better
So I live on..

I got my niggas, true niggas, real niggas
Stop the wheel, really?
You only feel me if you walk the same road
Talk the same codes
Still dwelling in the Hell and find the time to make a home
The few who escape tryna find a safer zone
I ain't waiting for Obama, never doubted him
I'm proud of him. He real, spend a couple million on the housing and
Seeing is believing, my vision is blurred
Cause I ain't seen nothing, I heard
Really ain't nothing but words, divine my mind
I'm still stuck to the curb
Sky high, but it wasn't the shurm
Really nothing but herbs - I risk it all for the cause
Even if it's war with the law
I can't/won't/don't stop, I ain't got an off switch
Dying trying to live it, just to get a small part of it
My squad is sick type that you don't want problems with
Rolling like 70 Mack trucks - what's stopping it?




I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Five score years ago, a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today


Look, homicide is illegal, death is a penalty
Never let go when you've got ahold of your enemy
Eagle claw cobra clutch by any means necessary
Ill never let it go, see my shadow ninja mic flow
I throw a great archer dart arrow to your temple
Almighty bow of Ulysseus the indigenous
Plan of the Wu-Tang Clan became a world brand
We never let it go, we talk a half a mil a show


Never let go of your mind
Its a terrible thing to waste
To lose, but its very hard to find
Being that ignorance is lethal
We must touch hearts, tune souls, harmonize the people
Never let go of your plan, execute
So when you shoot, inspire everyone on the land
Never lose knowledge of yourself
For it may become risk to your health
And great loss of wealth


Never let go of your cream, never let go of your dream
Players retire, but they never let go of the team
If you a rider then you never let go of that thing
Pull up your mans like you better let go of that bling
This lifes crazy, too many life sentences, maybe
Fatherless babies on the block but they father 380
Thats just the hood lately, never let go
Im what the hood made me
Momma told me to find a good lady


Never let go of staring at the death
Like yo, that's your best blow
I still hold on like En Vogue
The cold go to war with the heat
Eyes wide, never falling asleep
All the talking is cheap
Call'em, ultimate warrior, W.W.F
I come up victorious, struggle is nothing to Deck
Set it straight for the seeds, to see a better new
Take the real life by the rings and I aint letting go
I aint letting go


No matter what the odds be
No matter how hard we
You never let go


Never let go of the fight, never let go of the mic
My honesty, my values, my loyalty, my pride
And memory of those who have passed to the other side
Never letting go, Im never letting go of my beliefs
My faith, convictions, real
Both hands holding on, never let go the wheel
We hood legends, misunderstood
These lessons, learned
Growing up for manhood
Keep focus on the prize what you better do
A little taste of heaven, sunshine is where we headed to
States whats ahead of you, always on the schedule
Smoke the gold leaf down to the residue
Letting go, is something that I never do
Those who let go, live life regrettable
Never let go of your hope or your rope
Eyes on the prize, never let go of the scope
When Im in jail, never let go of the soap
Hold on, boy, never let go


Never let go, the all-eye-seeing, the supreme
Never let go the love of your seeds, or your queen
Never let go your heart, or the place you started
The feeling that I had, Wu-Tang had just charted
The old earth departed, I give thanks to the martyrs
I never let go the love I have for thy father
Never let go the glow
The more I know the more that it shows
I wont let go, even if I decompose
Your seed will carry it on, we need to carry it on
Pass the baton, life is just the marathon
And ain't' playing to win it, its an epidemic
Never let go, thats what the god recommended




And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. Who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. For many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom



(* Prod. by RZA with Fizzy Womack, Andrew Kelley)


Now, it's the master's turn though
I'm betting in, well there's a show here

Watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid, watch your step
Watch your step, kid, watch your step..
Yo, yo, yo

We take your wizzes away, like we be called on
Deep in space like the Millennium Falcon
Ya'll be fools, scored like ancient Babylon
Rabbits and turtles, all run the marathon
Yup, ya'll paper chasing, ya'll human racing
Who got the best basement?
You got a 6SL, I got a SSL
I score movies, make Supreme Clientele


Oh, here I am (my Wu-Tang slang is that New York City crack)
No, can't get it near, I quit (my Wu-Tang slang is that New York City crack)
All day, all night, what brings to you life
For you in the world (my Wu-Tang slang is that New York City Crack)

Silly rabbits, trynna disrespect The Abbott
Don't you know that we'll turn your cold body to maggots
I got forty million records sold, some platinum, some gold
Some we just put out to meet the tax code
Your career will be shorter than the 21st of December
Be one of those thousand rappers no one remembers
While my name is carved on trophies, colleges recite my bars
You can look up, and see my name up on the stars
And when it comes down to that basic talent
I got 20 little cousins that can meet your challenge
Yo, stop and listen, and check this proposition
Son, got lots of vision, plus lots of wisdom
Hindsight, foresight, insight, out of sight
Some try to imitate, but they are not alike
They only piggy back, have a Digi Snack
That Wu-Tang slang is that New York City crack



We're just dealing, of a man
Tough take before you
A cryptic to your power
The reason why we slept and spared your son's life
Was to give you faith
Thank you, man, thank you
You fight well, the hand must reach to the sky
Save the best for me, and have perfect breathing
Good breath control, you know of these





Silence the Pianos and with nothing drum, bring out the coffin
Let the airplanes circle mourning overhead, scribbling on the sky the message
He is dead, the stars are not wanted now. Put out everyone
Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun
Put away the ocean and sweep up the wood
For nothing now can ever come to any good

Allow, Allow, Allow to introduce myself
Chemande its the ODB

Children, do do yo thing, O-D-B. Like ODB say we for the children

Its Time for me to move on, Its not, its time for Old Dirty Bastard
To not exist no more, its time for a new Old Dirty Bastard
N you know a baby Old Dirty Bastard, not called old dirt bastard as that baby
But you will call him Old Dirty Bastard

Whats yo name, Old Dirty Bastard
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Filthy style understands. Say say say my name again
Scream at the top top top of your lungs
Old Dirty Bastard Live and Uncut

Why? Its always the good ones that have to die
You never expect it, that night I cried, I was like damn
(Noooo) There no need to cry, dry your eyes
Cause we all die

Thats the way the duray supposed to be around cryin and shit
Mothefucker go on, thats it, say shit we had big fun while he was here
Ain't no need to start cryin now cause he gone
Thats the way life is isn't it




Aiyo I roll like a Bat Out of Hell, evil acapell's fly
Spitting out of my grill before I hit the sky
With springtime colors, juicy as a Sunkist
Certain broads double Dutch this, they carve it in they wrist
Pillsbury blazes, straightening combs left on the stove
Crumbs in my lady hair, plus yours, the look gold
God, the old chain and ball technique, got these
Vegetable lasagne niggas in they whips, jumping out they seats
18 Bronzeman Part II
We like Dorothy Hamill on ice, we in your hood we might circle
Hats down low in the Range, switch lanes Change my tire, peel out, real loud on the stage yo
I shitted on your hood kid, I shitted on your hood
Got to your burner too late, I'm looking real good
Draped out, shining like a fresh fifty cent piece
"Yo girlfriend, come here, oh shit, you my man's niece"
The gourmet pocket twenty, bombs made of clay
Sexcapades take place, we fucking forty eight shades
Might walk up in your studio, time slap your engineer
Lighter fluid to DAT style, hand me the matches now


Aiyo rainbow Roley on the wrist, now what's this
Niggas bless this, eight and a half, Bally banana twist
E shakes, puffing on lye, feeding the seed's plate
Pulling out old .38s to rob gates
Major wake up, the kid tell tales, make a nigga head wake up
Beats break, the nigga whipped, take off his time
Honolulu status, gladdest, the rich rock cabbage
And dollar vans grands, that nigga mad savage
Stationary Hall of Justice, niggas came clumped out
Just came home, now they bunked out
Money be longer than triple life, till the Sun burn out
That's my word, move it with the burner out
Fidel way of thinking, roll with the Mac bent Ac-10
Most of my team, Five Percent
Check what the live said, rolling with Guess vests pedestrians
Yo, holding my nuts, fucking thousand dollar lesbians

 (x2)
Yo, the Older God put me on to how to rock this
Maintain 360 Lord live prosperous
It only takes a lesson a day, just to analyze life
One time in the respectable mind


Let the shot spark, soon as his pit bull barks
Tire scars from skid marks leaves from jams in school parks
Witness forget his original statement
Even in protection programs there's no escapement
Gunned down, three in town hit king from seven crowns
Spent rounds, catch him while he rhyme in the Zebra Lounge
Wounded, back in the '83 summer heat
Up in 3-0-9 park, rhyming off the drummer's beat
I stalk the city streets demonstrating mic wrecks
All looking stank, I ain't playing with a full deck
And as they nervously stare, I know they scared
They saw the coming of Wu in neon in Times Square
Household name assassin, Killa Bee
Mill to the grain that posess the Wu trilogy
Quick to spot those that bite camoflouge and blend
Those that got styles, they got identical twins
Don't stretch the small thing, copycats are finicky
Without skills, they master the art of mimicry
But I go line for line on the whole page
Your unspotted life on the mic is old age

{*rocket fired, whistles off and explodes, breaking glass*}



Unearthed by 




I saw niggas cough up blood when they hiccup
Hole in their stomach comin' back from a stick up
If you don't make it you can keep your half of the bread
I'm not playin' with you bruh, you halfway dead
If it was me, you'd probably say the same shit
Crack the drugs probably wouldn't get a rag to cover my shit
I'm just bein' honest Lord
It's $400,000 for the four of us
What's up with ya'lls
Damn Tone leave em alone
Shut the fuck up be quiet before I go in your bag
Then I'm gonna come up
You know how I do I get busy
If you can get through this near death shit I throw 'em the extra 50


Wu-Tang baby
They rock the world




Modern vampires of the city, hunting blood
Blooood, blood, bloooood.. blooood
You coulda from Rema, or ya come from Jungle
You coulda come from Fire House or
You come from Tower Hill
One bloood, one bloood, one bloood


I was rollin, showin my age, unshaven
Rugged with my Timberland boots that paid
I walk with a slight lean from the weight of my heat
Givin a green to shine infra-red beam
At the street traffic light recorders
Takin pictures of our corners
Cameras on the side of the buildings, we destroy 'em
The Chameleon throws cream to children, out the window
We movin in unmarked vans, disguised as a light tan
With plastic faces and rubber hands
Fuck fame, I shoot a hole in a 50 cent piece to test my aim
How dare you call the Gods in vain
Not knowin the seriousness of this and why I came
To Earth, feet first
I dare you lion tame to the beat of the drum
No questionin to the session, I walk with gun
The magnum'll bust his head from many directions unknown
Another statistic, change the ballistics
On the nozzle, make em goggle and swallow
Scrape the craters of the brain for data
Old scriptures on withered paper
Beginnin take shape and form
When the Gods get on it and crash your college dorm


You coulda come from uptown, or you come from downtown
You coulda come from outta town, or you come from 'round town
One bloood, one blooood, one blooooood
The fussing and fighting
The tribal war, racial war
Cause bloooood, blooood


Now verse 2, even more deadly than the first
Unrehearsed raw footage part 2 for you
I give this dedication, project elimination
Here's a burnt offering, nothing up my sleeve
I'm just vanishin with the vanishin cream
Here's jewels to live by
Identify before you enter and can't leave with weed
Fuck that, we waste no time in search of those who can't breathe
A bomb only has one time to explode
When I break I'm takin everything
Turn the city streets to Dusty Rhodes
Behold this return of the Invincible Tone
Rude like Governor Tuse and King Toustume
Who gave the order to bust 'em?
Don't ask this is Genuine Draft
Blueprint ultimate legit sting international, stone love classical
Comin back, to attack in black fatigue
Wu-Tang and Junior Reid


You coulda come from Lebanon, or ya come from Iran
You coulda come from China, or ya come from Japan
One blooood, one blooood, one blooood
You coulda come from uptown, or ya come from down sout'
You coulda come from outta town, or ya come from round town
One bloood, one blooood, one blooood
The fussing and fighting
Tribal war, racial war
Cause bloood, blooood, bloood
Mothers fighting daughters every day
Fathers fighting sons
Sisters hating sisters
Rappers getting murdered, every day
You coulda come from Lima, or come from Georgia
You coulda come fire outside or come from Hawaii
One bloood, one blooood, one bloooood
You coulda come from Brook-a-lyn, or you come from Bronx
You coulda come from queens, or ya come from Jersey
One bloood, one bloood, one bloood
You coulda come from Long Island, or ya come from Philly
You coulda from Canada, or ya from from over south
One bloood, one bloood, one bloood



"5...4...3...2...1...0"
*explosion*


Yea, this is the poisonous, venomous
Killa bee, queen bee connection
Live and direct
Shaolin, BK, QB, Boogie Down, wherever you found

Yo, yo, Deadly Venom is how we end em
Mask avenge em, no friend of him
Bend em in half for entering
My camaraderie move like tight security
Known to tear the club up plus the after party
On the battlefield catch a body
With no fair warning, my queen bee connect swarm on em
Primate, hold your mic straight before you challenge me
You lightweight and only force me to cause casualty
Battery packs catch match mines with the solar powered
They get over powered
Shower with rhymes just like white lines of powder
Feel the realness from being solo with this crowner


Yo, yo, yo, This time we takin no shorts for sure
Comin through, smashing motherfuckers to floor
Whoever wanted war, yo, bring it
If you got the sword, I'ma swing it
Slither back to the pit when my phone started ringin
Yo, Come here, what's up, niggas 'bout to get stuck
Niggas runnin through the chamber they ain't givin a fuck
Cuz I'm deadly, I'ma set the pace like a medley
Relay, who could match the venom on the replay


Aiyyo, the bitch nice and catch crack like dice
Give em a double order of manslaughter on the tape recorder
Fuck the law and order, tape muffled and distorted
All you heard was murderous shots, the rest was pre-recorded
The jury voted, I'm a free venom, hitting niggas with the momentum
Even villains wanna get up in em
The feeling's devious from the breathious
The way we leavin this is sure to make snakes hiss


It be I, the most high, fly robin fly
Keep a close eye on Johnny 5, I'll be comin live
From New York, it's Saturday Night
So it's only right, I step to the phony types
See em at the party actin hard, but they hardly a threat to the vet
Once you start me, no stoppin, no pardon me
No coppin a plea, I beat you in the head, third degree
What's the science, the 411, can't do me none
Still ghetto, I rhyme ghetto, my brother's ghetto
Never say die and never settle
For anything less than what the devil possess
I'm like MOP to the death
Now who is Johnny Blaze, Mr. Meth
Motherfuckers


Hittin fever, come with the raw
Deadly Venom with the Wu, no more to come, now what is left to do
(Ghetto collaborations, such a deadly combination
Face to face, Shaking your earth, rocking your nation)


Yo, yo, yo, Sons of bitches rollin with the devious Clan
I got a master plan that'll blast your man
Getting lyrical, pumping the venom deep in your mental
Like a pencil all in your vein, killin your spiritual
The original, fishing yall, rolling with a bunch of criminals
Street gunner, Venom strike like thunder
This some shit that'll stop your hunger
Ready for war, like me let you get a taste of the raw
Comin through with the Clan so you won't get far
Battles and scars, all respect due to the gods
And my queen killa bees just collecting that cheese
Overseas, gettin ready for the year 2G, DVs

(Poison Clan rocks the world)


(The Pillage!!)
Yo, I'm a great commodity, foresee me
The unchained magnetic
T release mine, fuck y'all, piece mine together
To the third power, hit y'all like the Mayflower Scandal
Slash three felonies to be the one six vandal
From Park Hill, Shaolin put the work in
From dusk do us dawn, Lebanon Don
Don't sleep on the adversary
Mental niggas stalk y'all out on the ferry
You got trapped in between pillage
And the venoms, cherry heads are minimum


Yo, yo, yo, projects of elimination
We jack some like Rhythm Nations
Got your hard speed like we drag racing
We lab replacing, but tried to avoid a confrontation
You kind of mixed up like Tiger Woods with that combination
I ain't called no names, here's a hint
Niggas with no names, antique things, gold chains
Do admire the visual, 'bout the coolest Carolina
Individual, Everything digital, like Bobby
I'm loving all them kung-fu flicks, poison the ivy
My crew be known to run through cliques, but fast in a hurry
We I smash, leave your vision blurry
Tryin to make the bill like Murray




Yo, on the french kiss, sour than blood, hotter than piss
You ventriliquist talkin out your ass like this
Cuz I insist that you don't wanna show the tape of the hit
I told yall, I crush yall on the tape like Kane
You tweaky trick, wanna violate, great, Wu and Venom annihilate
Don't hesitate to push the rhymes like weight
To shank Jakes


Yo, PLO, when the guns blow, you'se a no show, homo
Holding like a scarecrow with no dough
Street pro's move through the metro
Rapidly my faculty quick to blow the boost out your battery
My african queen bees is backing me, shutting down your salary
J-Boo twist another Daquiri, fifty steamboat float
Flow on this scenario, hydro thoughts lick off like a callico


Let's get it on, mic's get blown when you step into my zone
Heads get flown for trying to clone
Now take that, now you wanna go on
So go on, baby pa, hold on, while I flow on
Keep it tight, rip all sides to a square
You ain't seen no thugs like these nowhere
I swear, you wanna test me, how can it be
Rollin with the Fam, Wu-Tang, DVs


Yo, I dead MC's with this poisonous venom
Return and send em, wack niggas is in em
The secretly analyzed, this shit is live
I see the allies trying to stalk the bee hive
Forgot the deadly stinging was major bell ringing
Too strong for niggas with eyes closed and swinging
Make your point, spot your target and zoom in
Before its too late, saw the snake through his hand shake
Aiming your darts at a clique you can't handle
Attack with the paint stones and travel on camel
A warm sigh as you cross the barrier
But my storm side, will destroy your area



(Poison Clan rocks the world
Poison Clan rocks the world)



 x4
One of these days and you won't be long


I'm from the home where the buffalo roam
And niggas don't give a flyin' fuck
Talk with signs up, walk with the iron tucked
Leave your eyes wide shut
Money bag's on the table, gots to get my cut
Rebel I city slicker, pick up a pretty sister
Dig her out on the table, bent off the Rmy liquor
Head splitter, deliver so cold I send shivers
From many figures, battle the world or any nigga
I'm uptown saturday night like Bill Cos'
Got weed in the jars with vanilla cigars
On the strip, eyeballin' the chicks, all in the mix
Gassed off of my shit, vibratin' the whip

 x2


Yo I'm sicker than the V12 X5
With cracks in the Rolly jumper all we do is Drink fuckin' Drive
Real niggas raise up, Mommy get your feet off the table
The cable luck bare, my man got me one on his leckle
It's nothin' for me to get up with you, guts with you
Blow off them matches and sit up with you
Aiyo the streets, what is gettin' more crazy?
Stressin' me nothin', investin' the leathers, we all into things blazin'
Slingin' coke is just a normal habit, rappers we wear
Straddlers with cannons and hatchets gettin' cheers
Yatzis are fresh off the block, block squeezin', it's real
If we get real, put pop, poppin' at your blocks equal
Take these niggas and throw 'em in lakes, it's business
Rake these niggas on the mic, display your ninjas
Nines crowns verses your nine towns
Run up with nine 9's, brown down, get to lyin' you down

 x2


I come from the slums, I ain't no dummy
My testiment talk, represent money
This Verbal Intercourse, fueled by exhaust
The bread winner, head spinner, coldest with the force
No remorse, endorse the rap artist
So flamboyant cos I pimp slap the hardest
Ever since the triumph we've been missin' them soldiers
We came tonight, boy the mission is cobra, full exploder
Bulldose through the rubbish, I'm in too deep boy
I just gotta love this, they call we too sweet
One of the nine brothers, I'm so unique
Every line that smother, the situation's grim
It's bloody sin cos every time I want out they pull me back in
I see my reflection in the chrome mac 10
Ask the passer who's faster with the pen
Then pull it, nine hollows, amorettos
That's how I like it, sweat on my wine bottles
The automobiles with them shiny assed hubs
The endo pull, with the bathtub club, my angel's in the mud
Veteran smile, that's gangsta shit, that American style
Dig it, prick or prey
I'm quick to slay with the rectifier shit, caught by the ricochet nigga

"I got to know"

 x2

"I got to know"



Yo, you trying to catch this feeling
Old sad palace, the throne was invalid
Rasberry vinaigrette with the spinach salad
Bitches thinking they rich, dreaming
The fork scrape the silver plate
Chased by the finest Scotch whiskey
Brewed risky for 60 years, with 60
Bottles of Cristy in the freezer
? Cali but, the smoke's filthy




No matter how hard the times may seem
Don't give up our plans
Don't give up our dreams
No broken bridges can turn us around
Cause what we're searching for
Will soon be found


Hey yo listen here shortcake Camay glow
You know we both make angels when we lay in the snow
Heat the house with the oven when the chips got low
Because Tony can't be out there pushing that blow
We made plans and dreams, not grands and schemes
I want to search for the meaning of love, see what it means
Because we hustle so hard, cross so many bridges
Made babies, took trips to the mall for family pictures
And our souls is magnetic, we the meaning of destiny
Be that banker of trust that looks to invest in me
Together, to get her, means for me to get you
We back, reunite like the Wu
See we soulmates, we melt like cookies and cream
And I fiend for the days and the nights to sex my queen
So no matter how hard it seems, dreams come true
Keep Allah in the heart, hugs and kisses
Tony Starks




Still applying the pain
The purple frying my brain, this woman crying again
She tired of fighting, my feelings likely the same
Thats what happens when you wife them they try and tighten the chain
See, she in the right so I put her right in her lane
I'm all night with the pipe I can feel her biting my chain
She got her own I ain't got to buy her a thing
I be burning up the sheets every time I'm lighting the Jane
We go together like Martin and Gina
But she get uptight want to fight like Ike and Tina
So love her or leave her alone like I don't need her though
A minute later I'm back like I ain't mean it yo
We break up just to make up
She fly without the makeup
Together we upgrade to A+
So all this bickering ain't us, we bigger than that
You only cool when I'm digging your back
Now fall back baby




Shorty with the flavor like Breyers
Real sweet with your thick legs
Look like you drink eggs, you lying
Now you met a Teflon don
Stay high, Levi's on
YSL frames no games
I'm into cash man, getting this paper
Buying up acres
Ride around and yo fuck with my neighbours
Pocket full of hundreds and weed
Light the Philly cigar up
And go dolo, ride through SoHo
Ya that little baby in the back
That's the sound of sweet life
A sweet wiz will make you a sweet knight
Chill with the pawns, we on
Because life is a chess board
You better have your sword and vest on
Never hate your enemies because it affects judgement
They only hate it if they know you getting hella cheese
That's what it is, what it do for you?
Don't let the truth bore you
Word up, don't let the youth spoil






The echo chamber enhance the flow wit the block party
Keep an MC head spinning like Dark Bacardi
This B.A.C. is 2.3
Now the liver's damaged, but his lungs are joint free
So inhale, exhale, breathe and get well
Kick something live stop chirping like Nextel
I'm All In Together, a swordsman forever
I paint the town red, with many heads are severed
R-A-W, I still bring trouble to
Throw your raps in the sleephold, quick to smother you
Dart heat your breastplate, meet ya death date
Rook down a E4, look, it's checkmate
No other way to describe a catastrophe
The plan was drawing blood and displayed it graphically
Direct order, hit the border, then slaughter
Horrific torture, by prolific authors
Shape and mold MC's, like I'm playing the skelly top
It's getting 'hot in here' like the single that Nelly dropped
So take ya clothes off, the track is so soft
A little vodka turn 'em into Ivan Koloff
Why do the Gods make MC's study from
Thirty five, and fifty year, then try to become
Under the study with the sword above the head
So he would keep in mind under the open pledge


Fierce glisten, something so sharp
Piercing, swords cling, the vigilante intimate
Close combat, this is emceeing at its best
But there is no contest, sent I'm this
Speaking of a test, this and try to question this
He so different with the swiftness, godfather civilization
Shell casing, universal nation
Could he be the one predicted, presidential sent in
Old school soul survivors, we the wildest
Asiatic Arctic flow is so frigid


Is it, the Zig Zag, I'mma pay you a visit
Somehow mistake me as an old wise wizard
Word? I'm not the same
I go somewhere, don't remember how I came
Is it the weed, the hash or the 'caine?
Or the Digi being stained on my brain
Appear from a cloud of smoke, the voter's on choke
If surrounded, seven men drop from one stroke
Even if my feet was shackled down to one handcuff
To defeat me, ten demons wouldn't be enough
I sleep in the lion's den, without the steel iron
Ascended like Musa coming down from Mt. Zion
Superlogical this, superlogical that
Digital, take it back with superlogical rap
Have a shootout, at midnight, the sequel's quicker
Forty four colt jolt, all you seen was the flicker
You distress like the damsel, lost like little 'Hansel'
Your flame couldn't generate the heat of a candle
Me, I be a Killa Bee, keeping exilery
Ol' play the desert e, shoot ten millime'
Master the millipede, you try to end the sea
Your body being found in the naval yard artillery
A black blind governor, a rich white mayor
Man, this whole city ain't got a prayer
Bobby has invaded, now the whole town's slated
Your decapitated head is being tooken' out paraded
Up and down the avenue, I drive a shatterproof
Benz, and all my men's are tattle proof
My mic is a dyke, my life is a light
A Day to God is a Thousand Years, how long is a night?
You get trapped in my shadow of dark, hark, who goes there?
Power-U smells like carp, don't put your nose there
Drop you to a tank of sharks, your wound's bleeding
And it's been two weeks since they had their last feeding
Any leftover bones, we grind into sand
And spread it out, over 20 acres of land
Some call me Steels, cause it's hard to bend me
See Cipher Pigs can't apprehend me
In a no smoking zone, I smoke bones of hash
Niggas see me, then I disappear in the flash
Next time I'm spotted, I got the fatter wallet
Moving with a clique that stick like dry porridge
Someone's been sitting in my chair, who goes there?
To sub zero cold, your words can't flow here
Glaciers of ice, plus layers of spice
Say your prayers at night, 'fore you touch that mic




Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone


We don't hunt deer
Vegetarian dishes from the concierge
Presidential suites, presidential treats
Brazilian models, oilin' up my feet
10 days a month, my girl pays for lunch
3 days a week, we work out at Crunch
Time after time, line after line
Our stock increases, rhyme after rhyme
In the valley, of San Fernando
Found Q-Tip's wallet in El Segundo
Prolly been spotted on Telemundo
With more wild cards than a box of Uno
That spin like propeller, my dog like Old Yeller
Holler at the moon, my goons at Coachella


Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone


I got my hands in the pot, 500 grand in the yacht
I'm the dope man with plans to expand on every block
Wu-brand, legendary hands, hard as penitentiary rock
Now put that to your temple, the Wu symbol's 'bout to drop
Insert the beam on my Glock, got that lean in my bottle
What that mean? High self esteem, straight cream on the top
Ridin' chops similar to UFC kickbox, kick rocks
Dirty trucker pit stops, shit, grams in a Ziploc
Watch how the pitbull lock his jaws, then lock your doors
Feds watch the boards, hip hop spills out my pores
I be raw, for fourscore plus 7 more
The Clan rock the tours, we be them reservoir dogs


Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier


Guaranteed I bang hard
I plan to leave the game large, no brainwash
The devil himself could not persuade God, my blade's sharp
Circle my square, I dare you Braveheart
Before I leave your head in your hands, what's your name, huh?
My lines get in your cells like 7 Ls
Any problem, I address you like I'm sendin' you mail
Let me do well, they'd rather see me dead or in jail
But let it be my life story if they ever do tell
Know I died for what I live
An intimate connection for that infinite reflection
That's my wife and my kids, there's a price on my lid
So now my stock's high and shots fired
My niggas who was tight with the kid
I'm hot as Hell's Kitchen with the oven on
Deck bomb, teflon the rappers nothin' to a don
If I'm frontin' then respond
If not, throw up your arms, it's the Killer Bee swarm
And your set, the fuck is y'all?


You entering the 36, mastering the 18
Sliding across chamber sixth, hands down that'll crush bricks
Backs thatll break bats, this is what y'all wanted back
Classic Wu RZA track with Mathematic actual facts
That weigh heavy, the universal striking attack
Dance the drunken medley, long axe blade, machete
The shadow stepping ninja


Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier




Man you know there used to be rules to this shit
Nowadays people do whatever the FUCK they want
And worry about that shit later
That's the general mentality out here Kurt
You ain't hearin me
You wanna play this game
You can't cry when the game play you




The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man


Yo, pa, I got a lady, I'm 'bout to make her my baby
Might even make a baby, the thesis makin' her crazy
She know my style wavy, I'm circlin' her Mercedes
Father, father was a preacher, I'm almost certain he hates me
But he ain't gotta date me and look, his baby is grown
And she decides on her own who resides on the throne
I'm her king, she my queen, we keep it right in the zone
And she understands the fact that I'm even right when I'm wrong
When she was prayin' in church, I was playin' in dirt
That's 100, I admit that we both was playin' at first
When opposites attract, I ain't always sayin' it works
I'm just sayin' ain't no use in me strayin', that make it worse
It's Wu-Tang, baby, my crew bang
And she's the preacher's daughter, I just call her my boo thang
And we tighter than shoestrings, or 10 grand in rubber bands
Man, sometimes I tell your parents just don't understand


No. yo, you mean Pastor Brown's daughter?
The preacher, the rich slave-maker of the poorer?
I used to see her Sundays comin' from church
We used to kick it at her window when her pops at work
Yo, her parents didn't play
She couldn't even come out to play on a school day
Thought she was gonna give me some on April Fool's day
(But no, no way) nah, (no, no-no, no-no, no-no way)


The preacher's daughter, she an illegitimate child
She know the word, but she be runnin' in them streets foul
She married to a man, but she's crushin' his brother now
See her in the market place loud and boisterous
With tight spandex on, chokin' her oysters
She a seductress in the form of a goddess
Never virtuous or modest, poison the part is
Breakin' the vessel, turn brother against brother
Man, that's how she molest you
That's why the preacher man prolly a mess too
Cause the fruit that she devourin' is evil
Never sin around righteous people
Black widow, preacher's daughter comin' to eat you


The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man


I met her on the bus stop with black eyes
That's why she said she don't fuck with black guys
I cleaned her up, fed her all my wisdom
Her father spit the gospel but she never caught the vision
Brutal ass whoopins, always facin' these evictions
So she only fuck with thugs that'll wind up in the system
Them greasy bastards quick to squeeze a ratchet
Never knew the science of virtue, Ecclesiastes
Like, a time for peace, a time for war
A time to laugh though, she never felt God before
Eternal love that'll pop like a kernel, this is grown folk talk
Between me and her, it don't concern you


The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man



 I'm sick doc, when can you help me?
My mind's thinkin about shit I don't wanna think about
 Pssh.. that's yo' problem


Comfort me, you are this and that
You are this and that


Yo, check out yo..
I never listen to the things that my brother keeps tellin me
Hittin up thoroughly cuz my dreams are deep felony
Brothers on the beat have me high as I'm Brighton be
My legend on the verge of convertin me
Poppa be tellin me what I should be
Grand dad talks up things that I could be
Friends are finicky what I'm gonna be
When no one ever asked me, what I wanna be
A teenager house keep arresting me, big head and brothers keep testin me
I don't understand, the way my bothers lovin me
Outter world pushin me, inner world shoving me
No tape out but my friends keep provokin me
Commotion is constantly chokin me
Havin nightmares with guilt that is hurtin me
Tryin to avod this crab girl that is wantin me
Somebody help me, I've gotta be free
Of the trouble of society, I have problems




Now they got me out buggin, strung out on crack
Be gettin discriminated because I'm black
My house once was a mansion but now it's a shack
My best friend talked about me, behind my back
Things would change, I thought that at first, right?
Time goes on, things got worst
Poppa now drinking, and he hit me
When I relayed it to my girl, she quit me
Tryin to make a better way but it keeps holdin me
Deadly bomb, now she is schoolin me
My brother fightin me, neighbor dog bitin me
What is goin down? No one is invitin me
Be put into the parcel , it's not healin me
Broke as sex and it's killin me
I was a good citizen now I'm a leech
Get some other girl to increase my grief
My mom said that she better off without me
No girl, no friends, who cares about me?
Grand dad is mad, about to have a heart attack
Grandma is worried, she may think I'm on crack
I could collapse but I could feel myself
Come to the conclusion, maybe I should kill myself
You see what I'm going through?
I have problems, what can I do?




I go to sleep to keep my mind from my sorrow
Hopin it'll be a new and better day tomorrow
And as I sleep, I dream, rearrangin, changin all bad things
The light is clear, my thoughts flushed loose
Things that I do well I put it to use
I rap, I write, I co' rock the mic
I do things good cuz it's things that I like
So I make the demo tape with my voice on track
Took it to Melquan, he sent it back
With a note attached sayin he admired me
Made me a contract and then hired me
Now I'm makin records, everybody praise me
Do I get scooped man? It doesn't phaze me
My rep is known all on the town
I once was lost but now I'm found
Put the pen to the fullest, brand new attitude
To those who helped me, I give my gratitude
Have a new girl, new friends, new ways
Could pass the gun now I have a new thing
It is true we all have problems
Well reach deep down inside of yourself and you'll solve those problems...




Divine Prince Master Rakeem Allah




The Fuck?
It's just the new way of thinkin
Light up the broccoli kid
Throw the relish in my back pocket
Keep your eyes open
Push your seat back, just flow...
That's how we doin it

Bound by honest sword take over the set; rap from here to Que-bec
Throw up the tech, crash your intellect select a vet
Swimsuit mammal handle, yo every fly vandal go to project
Slam you like Hamill's wife 'fore the scandal
Wally sandal just a sample, my niggas fertilize thoughts
Yo mad support drink a quart then bamboo
When nasty can blew, my pen sterile won't perform if I'm not lampable
Askin my man'll get you slapped down; play the anthem
Lit it who wit it champagne get it, that's the ticket
Solid nines soundin like crickets snatchin worker shipment
Pull the air, long dick it, we talk right before we left lifted
Just like a long sleeve, guess who rip it?

 Projects
 My niggas survive, just like a movin target
 Projects
 Where niggas live and some sell garbage that's
 Projects
 Try to escape the flyin shells dodgin
 New York projects
 I'm livin large yo, stop miragin


Sign of the times, conspiracy to overthrow the mind
Behind every fortune there's a crime
This technique is tech-9
Blast at any Close Encounter of the Third Kind
This be the evil that man do, we dismantle, any adversary
Them niggas all thumbs and can't handle, my flurry
Hear me, you jam all you want to scare me
Don't even kid me, shit in my coke aimin at cha kidney
Pressure, Red Hot like Chili Pepper
Black 'n Decker, hardware avoid the leper
Five o'clock shadowboxer, hold down the sector
Bet ya bottom dollar lecture, be hard to swallow
Double oh-seven mark
The secret agent that Max/well and Get Smart, through entertainment
Welcome to The Killin Fields, with Johnny Dangerous
Headbanger boogie niggas goin thru changes

Suck my dick it's the kid with the fat knob
I bust all into ya face, plus it come in globs
Quick get on your knees, with yo' sweet pussy let it breathe
Two fingers is all in your hole, think I can fit three
Your pink lips, spread it in shit, let me throw my dick in
Grab my shit and place it gently, on your clit
Ping-pong pussy, wide world of wombs titty saggin
Stomach on some scriveled up prune shit
Too much air in your pussy you screamin that it's
TALKIN TO YOU DADDY, fart's breathin out your lips splashin my dick badly
Use vinegar, to try to tighten up your ginger
All-mighty dick, ran in with a cape, some call him engine
Lightning rod bob, black candy cane attatched to God
Thick, like a great adventure cigar, in your garage
Pregnant pussy have you fall out, like Remi on the house
Watch the teeth for slobbin my shit
You bit it on the couch, dry pussy leave the friction burns
Plus beef I hone, the condom broke
Bitch you got AIDS I'm shakin in my bones

DJ: "Wu-Tang again?"
C: "Ah yeah, again and again."


I smoke on the mic like "Smokin' Joe" Frazier
The hell-raiser, raisin' hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider-Man
So uhh, tick tock and keep tickin'
While I get you flippin' off the shit that I'm kickin'
The Lone Ranger, code red: Danger
Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart
The vandal too hot to handle
You battle, you're sayin' goodbye like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspectah Deck's on the set
The Rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal


The way I make the crowd go wild
Sit back, relax, won't smile
Rae got it goin' on, pal
Call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat
Blow up your project, then take all your assets
'Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, go flip on the next man
'Cause I grab the clip and
Hit you with 16 shots and more, I got
Goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh


It's the Method Man, for short Mr. Mef
Movin' on your left, UH!
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break, fool, cock me back
Small change, they puttin' shame in the game
I take aim and blow the nigga out the frame
And like Fame my style will live forever
Niggas crossin' over, but they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a "Suuu"?
Nuff respect due to the 1-6-oooh
I mean ohhh, yo, check out the flow
Like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off, because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt make me *cough*


Ooh, what, grab my nut, get screwed
Oww, here comes my Shaolin style
True B-A-ba-B-Y-U
To my crew with a "Suuuuuuu"


C'mon, baby baby, c'mon, baby baby
C'mon, baby baby, c'mon


Yo, you best protect ya neck


First things first, man, you're fuckin' with the worst
I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a fuckin' nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zu
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down, that shit is packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin'
Ason Unique rollin' with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
Bite my style, I'll bite your motherfuckin' ass


For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
There's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats; if Rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stompin' grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin' star
'Cause who I are is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar
Point-blank as I kick the square biz
There it is, you're fuckin' with pros, and there it goes


Yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that
It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feelin' mad hostile, wearin' Aropostale
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy robe, then attack the globe
With the buck-us style, the ruckus
Ten times ten men committin' mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums
(He'll be) comin' around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one down
Ju-Jugger-Genius, take us the fuck outta here


The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap
That's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact, bring out the girls, and let's have a mud fight!


You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck




Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to welcome to you
All the way from the slums of Shaolin
Special uninvited guests
Came in through the back door
Ladies and gentlemen, it's them!


Dance with the mantis, note the slim chances
Chant this anthem, swing like Pete Sampras
Taking it straight to Big Man On Campus
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Scandalous, made the metro panic
Cause static with or without the automatic
And while I'm at it, yo, you got cash, pass it
It's drastic, gotta send half to Dirty Bastard


Waves is spinning, blades is spinning
Slay em in the eighth inning
Stay truck, god stay playing linen
Kill rap, observe the uptowns, ho, feel that
Mink jeans on, seen where the real at
2000 Zitos, moving with a ill ego
For real, for real, ill lines, ill people
Yo, bring it back, 9 more civilians
Pollying deals, monopoly and bills, y'all niggas lying
Caught 300, lab look royal wit a mean stomach
Go broke, all seen, done it
Words from the heavy set, if I don't eat, then we already met
Fly ass bro, liver than coke


Now what Clan you know with lines this ill?
Bust shots at Big Ben like we got time to kill
Niggas can't gel or I'm just too high to tell
Put on my gasoline boots and walk through Hell
With 9 generals, 9 ninjas in your video
9 milli blow, semi-auto with no serial
Man metaphysical, I speak for criminals
Who don't pay they bills on time and fuck with digital
Never seen, smoke a bag of evergreen
My sword got a Jones, more heads for the severing
Johnny in the dungeon, taking all bets, throw ya ones in
Scared money don't make money, throw ya guns in


That's word to Damo, San Juan, Puerto Rico
Blowin hydro on a beach wit Tamiko
My gun bullet hollow for you to swallow
Blowin' the nozzle, hear it whistle
One in the head, this is code red, man for dead
X amount of lead spray from the barrel
Heat clear the street like Connor O'Carroll
Fully equipped, rifles, banana clip shit
To make my niggas from East New York flip


Yo, you may catch me in a pair of Polo Skipperys, matching cap
Razor blades in my gums (BOBBY!)
You may catch me in yellow Havana Joe's goose jumper
And my phaser off stun (BOBBY!)
Y'all might just catch me in the park playin' chess, studyin' math
Signin 7 and a sun (BOBBY!)
But you won't catch me without the ratchet, in the joint
Smoked out, dead broke or off point (BOBBY!)


Wallo's comfortable, chocolate frosting
Your socks hangin' out, yours is talkin'
Rock so steadily, son, I'm still crazy
Sport my old Force MD furs from the 80's
Nat Turners wit burners, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Taught y'all niggas how to rap, reimburse me
Rothsdale's, ruby red sales, Bloomingdale's, blocks
Ox tails chopped up in Caribbean spots
I'm nice, maxed out, creepin' wit the ax out
Murder these bikini bitches, switchin with they backs out


Niggas wanna pop shit, I pop clips
Bitch, I'll put my dick on ya lips
Alabama split, hammer slay quick
That David Banner gamma ray shit
Shells in the mouth, jailhouse snitch
My powder voice, Snow White sniff
Verbal killas, gorilla grip
God body shit, puff Marley spliffs


You might see me in a 6, that's not my style
You might see me wit a bitch, that's not my child
I be in the benzo, keep a low profile
Dead serious, take flicks and don't smile
Tryin' to get money, y'all cats is wild
I pose for the clothes, make a song like wild
I'm a chip off the board game, got sword game
Live life to the fullest, still want more fame
Darts on layaway, beats on standby
Outfits pressed up, ready for airtime


Run on the track like Jesse Owens
Broke the record flowin', without any knowin'
That my wordplay run the 400 meter relay
It's on once I grab the baton from the DJ
A athlete wit his iron cleat in the ground
Wireless nigga who sprint off the gun sound
The best time yet still 7.0
Swift flow made the cameramen clothes blow



Lay ya hammer (lay ya hammer)
Lay ya hammer kid (lay ya hammer kid)
They want the drama bring it to 'em Fuck 'em


All rise meet the preacher this pro dueler been diagnosed
Diabetic keptic I'm your host
Lock the vanilla suede British
Staten Island mall menace
Otherwise posing as a dentist in my lenses
Pinball machine gun rap spoke to Arafat
Laundry maid honey can't blow in this hat
What


Is it raw now, change it around
It's war now, the final countdown commences
The battleground is twelve inches of wax paper
Breaking down your defenseless senseless nature
Pain stings with 'Ma Baker
Twin towering I skyscrape ya
Freedom come meet your maker


Yo; Another sound boy's dying
Crowd noise multiplying
Don't let the fuzz slide in bust out the sirens
Sure win lure 'em in like exotic women
I smile with the sinister grin and finish him
You're fucking with hoods, get ya goods pushed back
Ya fraud, pull the wool off your Hollywood hat


The track melts in half liquors have this brave meaning
Supreme being being all that I can being
Picture wavy beavers meat cleaving your receiver
Fly sunny cheeba leather buckets dirty reefer
Fast floatin grill residential honey hill
Stainless steel rashes sheisty catch a money bill


It's all gravy
We floating through like the British navy
Fresh design lady  love the fade keep it wavy
The mix drink - throw the dick in the drink
Play it baby girl caught ya
Exotic album Cuban Link
Custom AV's beige panties who could front on these please
Y'all niggas broke so much your uncle sells trees


Yo; High ranked officials and armed tanks and missiles
Blood drizzle simple fact you slept on the issue
That before he started jerkin' off joysticks and Sega
I made tapes a hundred watt amps Cerwin Vegas
RZA fine tune it shipping meal units
MC's ask, who be those rhyme killers in masks?
No doubt difficult task to last in the square
Beware infinite amount of darts is in the air
I'm victorious no opponents and blast through components
And microphones watch the whole world live the moment
Anything anti that came approaching this
Incapable lust speech remains motionless

Lay ya hammer (Lay ya hammer)
Lay ya hammer kid (Lay ya hammer kid)
Lay ya hammer (Lay ya hammer)



(*Prod. by Fizzy Womack, Andrew Kelley, Noah Rubin)


Chef... let's do it...

Criminal kingpins, gangstas and cheap friends
Actors, vixens, niggas put your kicks in
Blood money when we hawking, ackward gun that go around curves
Bullets braze niggas with coffin, yo
Watch how to rhyme with hammers, I got two mens
That don't speak English, shooting game's bananas
Down in Spain, my bangles, clusty, checking my swings
Trillians on, yo, cuffing my jeans
Broad day, yo, body another, my microphone is like
Blow 'caine, one, pull the trees, you love us, yo
So killers be cool, pimps, read rules
When a grown man is rapping, it's Ill Street Blues
Striving, nigga, with one side
Don't go against totally rent shit, nigga, baby gonna die
Yeah, bank robbers armored up, gear like the boys in Heat
DeNiro told one soul to keep quiet

Aiyo, word to mother
Ya'll niggas better bring ya selfs son, word

When Pun was packing a mack in back of the Acura
I was dealing in them buildings, it wasn't no cameras
The witness savages, snitching was hazardous, now it isin't
Shit is embarrasing, fuck a flow, this is a lyrical aquaduct
Sink or swim for what I'm hearing you bagging up
Lyte like the MC, I'm 'paper thin', you tripping
I'm taking trips, your eyes don't lie, take a glimpse
Into my life, you see me blazing clips, with the green to make it rich
With a team that'll scrape the Knicks, and a v that's crazy quick
I came to wear my Yankee fitted, represent for greatness
It's lyrical elevation, causing mental stimulation
If I'm getting too deep, I give you a minute to take in
My jewels radiant, like a view of the Caymans
And thinking you seeing me, who you playing with?
Cor, Mega, raw forever
Fell back, pause, fell off? Never

P! Shaolin, what up?

Aiyo, listen giraffe neck niggas, I blast techs
Alejandro, came through with the Mexican Aztecs
Rap smack niggas on a whole different aspect
Homey, owe me dough, that's how we fucked up his last check
Three train Saratoga, train stop, nigga been
Metro part with the plan, make major figures
Foul flagrant, two shots, give me the ball back
You got shot, get off my ball sack
You not hot, give me a call back, niggas is all wack
Super doopa stupid, get drugs and I fall back
P, ain't a problem that the God can't handle
I set it off First Blood, Sean John Rambo
Whoooo, as you can see, I'm focused
Boot Camp for life, fuck the G.I. Joe shit
Boot Camp is an Army, better yet a Navy
Marine Air Force Ones, nigga, the shit's crazy, don't play me




You will be punished (Wu-Tang style)
For all your evil deeds (Wu-Tang style)
Be warned - you will suffer (Wu-Tang style)
Justice (Wu-Tang style)


Slept on this hazardous enterprise
Hit from the back, from a long range attack in disguise
Week self-captivity became months
Those who were holdin' it down they hold a pump
Do we delay the conflict and prolong the suffer?
Got a mass of starvin' niggas wanna eat supper
Unfair corruptions lead to abductions
Creatin' wider circles of destructions
So we attack, with the pen and blaze in
From the terrifyin' to the fascinating
Quick to slay a narrow minded nigga that's hasty to give credit
Full of hostile overtones mixed with wack edits
They heavily defended airfields
But they bodies rot behind punctured steels
When I greeted you, you didn't hear a piece of my voice?
Oh that water was my liquid of choice
Forensic couldn't tell it, it was nine tons of steel pellet
Powerful projection, noise is deafening
Carrier battle groups, that's threatening
Higher level bombing, plus
The shipment in hand known as alarming, bells ring loud
In the same crucial manner but different style


Wu-Tang style
Wu-Tang style


Ayo once again, all blunts again
Yo the real remain silent, any type of violence I'm in
Allah's helpful most, innovative raps
That brought wealth through, shot out the belch too
We holdin', automatic semis with sick lines
Run up, body niggas, break down shoddy niggas
Styles so sharp, state of the art
Greater the mark, flyest creator sprayed layin' darts
Flowin' like water, "Apocalypse Now"
Gun out blaow, wow the shit's wild when you short us
Runnin' through parkin' lots, don't get caught
Let off, bark your shots, we outta here, off the blocks


It ain't all to the good, muh'fuckers hatin' in the hood
Gotta a hundred wolves waitin' in the woods
For the Clan's forthcomin'
I miss you in the game a court summons
And fugitives of rap caught runnin, y'all get locked up
E'rything was wack 'til we popped up
And got it on and poppin' like Orville Reddenbacher
Potnah, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
Wu-Tang got ya, like every ghetto got a Tasha
Request lines are now open, you see these MC's chokin'
And thinkin', "What's that SHIT they be smokin'?"
I'm so focused, simple chronic halitosis
Keep my shit funky when I spit this braggadocious
{*hach, spit*} Y'all niggas got some fuckin nerve
To critic what I write, that's my muh'fuckin word
Blah blah blah, like N'Sync
Kiss that ass bye bye bye knahmsayin'? I ain't playin'


Many shall come, few chose to stay exact
Track after track I'm fightin' for survival
Before me I see hills and mountains they sway
The words gotta move and the crowd's like the ocean
I walk water holdin' y'all suspended with the vocal
What's the total people that came to see the Gods?
I gave thought talent, construct my best poetry
Potentcy, high-level content
Side effect may cause a tec to eject, many places
All ages streets to cages, split faces
Shoutin' nuff love to the peeps from Miami
We live from Pulaski and spread glassy


Wu-Tang style




RZA came and got me, this what I came to do, come on
Ring the bell so it's time to eat
Brick Dog stash weed inta AMI-seats
Bomb inside the palm
Doc rock a wifebeater with me beatin my wife ass ironed on
The front with my pump built like the Klumps
To carry it I take the spare out the trunk
I stay hungry, I ain't worked for days
That's why you see the pump when the curtains raise
Blast! Don't panic
Do I gotta explain how I tame and lock the rapgame single-handed?
Hell nah! I won't tell you son
If I find a wack ID I sell you one
Doc and Hot Nick, Inspectah
My lecture's like Hannibal Lector's
Where's the ketchup?
Don't speak on it, shut ya trap
I see ya whole crew yellow like mustardpacks
Ah woo, Doc in my own zone
You say you got the rapgames sewn, but it's sewn wrong
I ride through ya hood in a Mr. Softee truck
Then pull a mac out a box of snow cones
Yeah, ya little fucks
Gimme ya fucking money!

*Shout-outs from Raekwon and Ghostface*


Uhuh, check it
I'm hotter than a hundred degrees with my coat on
Playing with a dynamitestick, where did I go wrong?
Somebody pull the fire along when Jonny stomp
If ya lukewarm leavin ya clothes and boots torn
Pro's and con's, megabomb's and so-on's
By arid actions try MC's to get their roll on
First issue got issues
What is hip-hop to Hot Nickles?
It's like Funk Doc to snot tissues, word
Look at my hand and get the third
Finger out ya earhole like: Fuck what you hear
Now that's what I call hardcore, let's act fool
Mr. Fix-It like Handyman I pack tool
I been shitty, I'm from the bowels of the city (New York)
And just because my outfit match don't make me pretty
Baggy dungarees, dick need room to breathe
In a room full of crackers I might cut the cheese
Ain't no rules to the game, if it is we ain't playin
In your business like EPMD, "So What Cha Sayin'"
You co-signin that bullshit yo man tryin
Chaka chaka cha-ta tatat!!
Slugs flyin

*Shout-outs from Raekwon, Ghostface and Inspectah Deck*


Yo, ya
Check, the code echos from magazines to the big screen
Fo' wheel machines like ya wits scream
Kids fiend from the urban to sub-urban
Roll upon me thirstin like: Hey, hey, Mister Dream-Merchant
We roll longer than dice in a casino
Cee-lo in the 4, 5 or 6 with double 0
Behind the tinted windows I lay low
On some hydro tryin to slide from the 5-0
But now I get wild similar to Ol' Dirty
A third time felon just hit with over 30
No worries, style have em so thirsty
First degree heats are quittin on me
Cold turkey, no mercy
I bring the pain of a hundred migraines
But a thousand shoutin my name that's why I came
But first bring the cashburst, then the outburst
My surround sound pound ya ear like Jevon Kearse
I flex muscle outside I find a next hustle
Trouble with ya here and face the TEC-muscle
Even the best buckle win
I take it to the extreme
It gets ugly, but it's what a nigga do to get C.R.E.A.M
This life

*Shout-outs from Raekwon and Ghostface*




"I have taught you well, everything I know
You have even surpassed my skill
But why is it so important?!
Years ago, your father was a royal guard
The best that there was
He won many royal merits
But still, during a special contest
He was beaten by five {?} experts
He was disgraced, and so was our Clan..."
"It was long ago, but he has never forgotten that day though
And you are his only hope, to redeem the Clan
And retrieve our honor..."





Fuck ya'll niggas is talkin' bout? (clack clack-cla-clack clack)
Crunchy chump motherfuckas, ya'll niggas is all pussy
That's my word, ya'll know how the realest niggas is
Don't let me tell ya'll again, bitch, straight up
I put all this right there, on niggas in H.T.M.'s son
Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo


All magazines lit, fly life we live
The lingo is to let, ya'll niggas know, how niggas rep
I'm set, lightin' the purple in a new jet
Triflin' work, let's murder everything that move on the set


Goin' back to basics, shit you catch case with
Style laced with, arsonic, before you taste it
Rap matrix, gemini's is two faced it, I heard Rob Based it
"Bad boys" retire out the game just like Mase did
Dish it out and take it
To where I'm bout to go and everybody ain't gon' make it


Blow shipments out the rap shit, clap shit
Most of us attack shit, mean Benz, ballin' wit the bad chick
Take over, quick fast, violate, slap shit
And every borough, state, town, prison, map shit
Makeover hoes that blow, they attract dick
Shine on my jims, glow, on the low, slap dick
To every mean queen clean, keep it black chick
My motto, CREAM, green bottle of the phat shit




"Brothers respect mine!" - Raekwon
(Uh, uh, what, for real nigga, step the fuck off?)


Aiyo, Ice Cream, real niggas in whips
Fur coats, Gucci boots and shit, fly honey dip
Streets and clips is what we live for, rub on the floor
Ox in the jaw, rockin' the four, rugged and raw
Righteous and more, we the gliders, the outsiders
Killa Bee hivers, the big boy drivers
The conivers, the four fivers, survivors
We the livest and carry the heaters, coke is in the meters
Six to eight seaters, circle the mind readers
Pumas, Nikes, and Adidas, hip hop achievers
Love hood rats and love divas, love money, love sex
Love vets, love weed and love wrecks


All in together now, follow me the Method
Raw individual, the enemy you slept with
No love here, no tender, love and care
But M.C.'s, I'm starvin', niggas best before
For consumption, for wack assumption
You can catch a bad one or somethin'
From shotgun, you know I'm pza-pza-pumpin'
Jumpin', thumpin', get crunk and
Drunk inside the function
+Uncontrolled+ with the +Substance+
+Beneath the Surface+ there's +Redemption+
For Bobby Digital +Supreme Clientele+ convention, +Nigga Please+
+Immobilarity+ they can't breath til they +Blackout!+
I used to write and smoke L's in the crackhouse
Pull your wig like a potato then I mash out
Check your ego at the door
Better wipe your feet before you step me, or it's yourz!






It's Wu motherfuckers, Wu-Tang motherfuckers
It's Wu motherfuckers, a Wu-Tang motherfuckers
It's Wu motherfuckers, a Wu-Tang motherfuckers
It's Wu


Reunited, double LP, world excited
Struck a match to the underground, industry ignited
From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth
Wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf
Scatting off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily
Tragically, that style deteriorate rapidly
Uncompleted missions, throwing your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up if you mastered addition
Where I come from, getting visuals is habitual
You're more safe walking on hot coals in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall, formed a mural
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it was plural
Rhyming while impaired, dart hit your garment
Pierced your internal streamlined compartments
Just consider the unparalleled advantage
Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage


Bitchass niggas counterfeit the funk
I smoke the bead of the skunk, tree top of the trunk
Moonshine drunken monk, your head get shrunk
Your treasure sunk, I be fucking bitches by the chunk
My name black, you worms wanna play in my dirt
Bitch stop, my Momma serve free lunch from the church
I cum like a thousand doves
Bitch you quiet at the bus, making no fuss, I gots tough love
Unglove the noose, watch a nigga transfuse
Dirty add to the fuse, heavy at the booze
I don't walk, I get carried
Gold and platinum Frisbees on my wall, looking properly
But comely, I U.F.O. you Wright Brothers
The Indian that sold Manhattan to the white man
My grandfather, stepped up and get knocked right the fuck out
Come to the cook-out, dirty bitch at the mouth
You scared, run around like a plane about to crash


Wu-Tang motherfuckers
Wu-Tang motherfuckers
Yeah and RZA


The Riddler, funny bone tickler, freak Caligula
Bigger dick sex enigma, pistil fertilize your stigma
Stinkbox order from Pink Dot
MCs get stuck on ink blots, AirSound plug to the sinkbox
Wu-Tang Incorp. take your brain on spacewarp
Talk strange like Bjrk, great hero Jim Thorpe
How can I put it, life is like video footage
Hard to edit, directors, that never understood it
Too impulsive, my deadly corrosive dosage
Attack when you least notice through explosive postage
I don't play, the rap souffle saut for the day
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig A Leg Leg Arm Head
Spread like plague, we drink Hennessy by the keg
I got the golden egg plus the goose
Eighty proof Absolut mixed with cranberry fruit juice
Ginseng boost, I got your neck in a noose
Keep my money wrinkled, the rap star twinkle killer instinct
Sixteen bar nickel sell more copies than Kinko
Grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us
And we return like Jesus when the whole world need us


Is it appetite for destruction?
Slap a murder rap on this production
I touch something, trust nothing
Iron Lung/Twisted Metal
I see 'em ducking my dart gun, busting from every angle
Worldwide total carnage, the sickest flow
That be codenamed Agent Orange, killing you slow
It's only right you pay homage
To those that's 'bout to blow like that shit up your nose
Solid as a rock when I strike target
Verbal be screaming on you like a drill sergeant
Herbals got me where I wanna be right now
Don't know the time
Check the hour on your sundial, watch me shine
Drunk off of cheap wine
Each line be on point when I speak mine
On behalf of my crew, SUUUUUUUUUUU, Enter the Wu
36 more deadly Chambers to take you through


It's Wu motherfuckers
Wu-Tang motherfuckers

 Oh yeahhhh, ahhh, aiyy yeahh yeahhhahh aiii
 And RZA...






Reunited cuz it feels so good   Yo, yo, niggas ain't shit
Reunited cuz we're understood   Your bitch ain't shit
There's one perfect thing and   Your momma ain't shit
Children this one is it         Your daddy ain't shit
We both we're so excited cuz    You ain't shit
We're reunited, hey! hey!       Niggas ain't shit
Your momma ain't shit
Your daddy ain't shit
You ain't shit, you ain't shit
Yo, yo


Reunited, double LP, world excited
Struck a match to the underground, industry ignited
From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth
Wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf
Scattin off soft-ass beats, them niggas rap happily
Tragically, that style, de-ter-iate, rapidly
Uncompleted missions, throwin your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition
Where I come from, gettin visual is habitual
De-mon-strate walkin on hot coal, in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall, it formed the mural
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it, was plural
Rhymin while impaired, dart hit your garment
Pierced your internals, streamlined compartments
Just consider the unparallel advantage
Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage


I'm known on the microphone as the rap professor
Casual dresser, you may dress fresher
The way that I speak this shit is energetic
My physique of meat is quite athletic
Remove all MC's who disapprove
That my funky fresh particle always have the groove
You're jealous over me because you're not a competitor
You're just a donor, I'm the rap editor
Tryin to rock the mic when you get an appetite
All negative on the mic, I dislike
Try to rock the mic but only will reduce
Try to get loose, you juice as a youth
Not knowin to yourself that you shall be frozen
I'm the MC warrior, who has been chosen
To rock and shock beats, polite when I recite
Sulfur MC's, you are down right, out right
Try to be talkative, there's no alternative
Hide until I forgive, this motive
I am unique with the perfected physique
The objective of my rhyme is my own technique
I maintain the paradise on this Earth
With the shut the fuck up style for what this shit is worth
Watch a nigga catch a purse
Super-hero niggas die
Do my dirt, get away and multiply
You bitches, ya nice guys
Always want bitch, because ya need mine
I pleased on how I get up on the stage and fuck up the show
Cuz nobody can't fuck with me!
You bootleggin buyin motherfuckers, don't do that with me
With all these child-support cases I got, I needs my money!
Earl for ages, a 100 and down, sacrifice ya baby to the underground
The best kept secret, how does it feel to be boxin in
Like a skeleton, growin back ya skin?
When I was young, I was taught how to produce
The science of babies gettin loose
I turned white boys to Springsteen spruce
Black to spooks, gave the Chinese Bruce
I can't help it if my style is foggy, monster boogie
Get ya high on my patio, all come to see me movie
Bicthes, you're walkin on my dirt
We ain't sayin nuthin
I whisper in ya ear, make ya blink cold Pert
Love potion, plenty bones I put up
What!? What!? What!? What!?
You know what time it is
Mothefuckers!


Reunited and it feels so good    It's Wu mothefuckers
Reunited cuz we're understood    ah, Wu-Tang motherfuckers
There's one perfect thing

You asked me to secure a place for you in history
History is watching, waiting for a decision
This is your moment


Ayo, revenge is sweet, that's why I take my time with it
Like good pussy I just stay when I'm up in it
Evil plan, my mind functions well off spite
I don't do that tit for tat, I blow your shit up like dynamite
Take my life, I'll take every one you love
Have your kids thrown out of a plane, Look out cuz
My plots are like movie scripts, they well planned
Snatch you off the land and drop you off in the Sahara sand
So don't scam, don't try to double cross me
My Tennessee goons'll nail that ass to the cross, B
Revenge mode, I live life by the sword
And if you live by it, die by it, I'll still kill your horse
Set me up, coming back, like a thief in the night
I'll have a suicide bomber pop up on your flight
You couldn't take my life, my mask done resurrected
And I'm Ghostface Killah, way more than you expected


Those involved with this tale cursed the day they ever heard the name Tony Starks, and wreaked the day they heard the music was played from the records which comprised of his flesh


Yes, but what they didn't expect
A hundred ghouls from the projects
Armed and masked with flamethrowers and gas'll blast anything
Hung him by his tongue ring, till he gave the info on how we find his kinfolk
Made him sign the ransom, then gave the note to his grandson
Bust the shot and made him run fast back to his family
News of his discovery would set off a chain of events
That would then lead to members of DeLucas to bleed with no exception
They sent the wrong message so kill everything, no exception to the media
There would not be a retire or cease fire till every Luca has expired, in entirety
Wishes of the god, Tone Starks to eternity, respectfully


Cutthroats, murder sprees, and killings were synonymous with his gangsta life before his passing. So it'd only seem fitting that it would become the embodiment of his new life


I keep having flashbacks of blasting at you bastards, cutting outside the benches
Got convicted of the gun charge and laughed at my sentence
Four years, five flat post-release supervision
For niggas spitting in the wind, but that's what I get for missing
So soon as I hit the bridge again, niggas is finished
Ninja mode on a mission out to end your existence
Think I'm sitting up in prison with a tin of L, in a cell, sick ass hell, listen
Everyday is like Christmas, I miss my seed and my missus, but I see em on visits
I ain't stressing over pussy, beat my dick to her pictures
When they free me I'mma see you, leave you food for the fishes
Hope the Luca crew is in for the fixing, now get the henchman
Line em up, Tommy gun em down, the muzzle extension
Tear they flesh off if one of em flinching






The Chinese have a saying: "Dangerous men will meet in narrow streets." And so it was. We were raised between the clans, and that meant pressure on me to make more weapons. And as word of the gold shipment spread, strangers suddenly appeared in jungle village


 Machete still stainless
The archbishop run from the narcs
A crisp biscuit plus play the harp, wrist glisten
Goon captain, catch me in Africa black down with 4 5 Somalians
Black Tims, rubber suit Wonder Woman bangle a blue coupe
I'm usually upon the roof countin' mad loot
Root beer reefer, teeth frame, doin' my 1, 2
Smokin' with a plain Jane trooper
Excellent with rifles, out in Japan
In a flight goose switchblade that poke out the Nike boots
Thrusted on a bullet train with chains on, gettin' my train on
Thunder money, make bread, brainstorm
All this is made for the Forbes list
Broads get pissed, say "Yo he fucked me out his drawers he dissed me"
All this is calculated, the Batman with a black hand
Mafia money, killas who rock tans


Bone crushing, smooth kicks, blades choppin' through bricks
Masters of the weaponry, sells to both cliques
Blacksmith, with the iron fist
X2


Rigor mortis, I watch the body rot to the bone structure
Scrape out your brain, watch your eyeballs rupture
Black magic, leave your fuckin' skull in a soup pot
Makaveli, Vamoose like 2pac
Suicidal tendencies, down the white Hennessy
Look in the book, I'm the definition of menace b
Chokin' niggas out for no reason, it's duck season
I'm cold as ice, 6 degrees below freezing
Stay dipped, rock a striped shirt like Freddy Kreuger
You'se a baby piranha surrounded by barracudas
Seven thirty, I'm more like 6 o' clock
Straight up and down beatin' up niggas till there's blood in they socks
Ox em, duff em', stuff 'em in black bags
Without gettin' no blood on my fresh rags
Ruthless, heart of a stone, grown with no emotions
I piss out brewhas, poisonous potion




Yeah, it's the three deadly venoms with weapons in the denims
Some shit that'll shake windows and break lay tenants
Come left field, aim crooked and straight blaze in em
Have you niggas with straight-legs with a fake leg in em
Wolf in sheep's clothing, eyes scoping a tender lamb
Spin you bitches like a ballroom dinner dance
G-Mode dress code got suspender clamps
Russian roulette, money bet, go and spend your chance
You little fleas get killa bees and army ants
EMS cut up your jeans like zombie pants
Hollow chrome to your collarbone
Ping against your dome piece and sound like the first key on a xylophone
Grown men discussing death and the malice tone
See how quick the smiley faces turn solid stone
Ghostface, Rae and G be the wildest known
We straight street, we keep seat in the palace throne








Go head..


Give me all Gucci colors, my niggas get real for brothers
We idolize big lines and nines
Jumping out of big joints live, projects
Lot of objects, front if you want, you gon' die
Lex with a sawed off, Killah gonna tax him in the Waldorf
All bloodhounds, pop, show it off
Actin' like that money ain't live
Built it from the getty-up, New York City gonna fry
Aiyo, son, I take mines, rape lines
Yeah, I'm realer than Rikers who orchestrate great crimes
Jump out the Lex', lookin' zesty, real Nestle
What, picture nigga, except bless me
God, I'm high-powered, gun of the hour, crafted Flowers
Give it the blend, double it, and blow like the Towers
All ya'll need to take showers, can't take what's ours, pa..
Been sellin' crack, been sellin' crack
Been sellin' crack, livin' the black
Revealin' how we flip that, strip cats
We write rich raps
Help out the body
Me, similar to the Gotti story
I'm kinda young, son, a fly forty
The Reverend cold shittin' on shorty, did it to shorty pop
And gave him like ten in his jaw piece
Remember this sayin': "Staten Island Gun Slayers"
It's mayors, all gauges, minimum wage the raises..


...like to Rock..


Niggas be killin' me, actin' like they ain't feelin' me
Knowin' they bustin' them guns with my artillery
Usin' my words as if it's his and hers
That's that shit that make me not wanna pass the herb
The fake artist, I'm coming Razor Sharp regardless
I bump lah, sowed of liquor, light and spark
Make it crunk live, the dirty dirty try and serve me
Like black folks in scary movies: you die early
Tony Toca, Meth Tical, vida loca
Esta loca, if she think I eat the chocha
Ma, toss the, smoke ya, win free (Winfrey) like Oprah
And un-hoast that roast, your meat, for the butcher
Licky lost ya, don't even come a step closer
When I approach a track, I slam like my culture


Chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that


GZA told you it's a "Cold World", where ya heat at?..


...like to Rock..


Hots on the shit, just so we can lock horns
Throw a package in the streets, get the block warm
Something happens when we meet, hit the block strong
Get it poppin' in your face, taste the popcorn
Now that we back on track, can't lose
My back gets huge, bitches Moulin Rouge
The way I move, the Cadillac, so smooth
Battle rap improve shit, light the fuse
Bruised off the booze liquor, doozy kicker
The dynamite style, shinin' lights still flicker
Wu-Tang stickers is a nuclear reaction
Tony Touch scratch the table, RZA on the back end
Pure, the talent, yes, yours truly
The brand combination of jazz, class and beauty
Here to do my duty, up another notch
The gospel according to rap is mega watts
Agenda never stop, dead center, mega hot
Go mop it up, go cop it when it drops..


Woman, you sure like to Rock..


Haha, come on over here..




Coach, put me in the game
I'm for real, for them peoples tryna to put me in them chains
Whatever the topic, let's put it in the frame
We can even load it and cock it and put it in they brains
I'm saying, some rappers do it for a chain
Kill yourself, I know killers that'll do it for some change
These veterans is slipping, they ain't doing it the same
I don't slip, set a pick and put a shooter in your lane
Precise, 'bout shoot them at the range
But I ain't tryna shoot it with you rappers
I'll just shoot it at your dame
Y'all never should have threw me in the game
Found a new word for weed, that was so mean
I threw it in my name


My song banging loud on the block like arms spraying
The law hating, warring like Blacks and Caucasians
God versus Satan, I'm laying in the dark
With the Mossberg waiting, letting off first basing
Slim from the cotton club washing a scrub
Deuce high when he cruise by, spotting his love
Hold the mic like a .38 muzzle to snub
This flow, call it OJ blood on the glove
Above rap, capital Gs speak on the facts
Please believe that, meaning that I keep it a stack
He's back, he a beast on the track
The only time that I go soft is probably with your freak in the sack
Feel the bass make sure he shake, murder verse, first forty-eight
Manslaughter, nearly caught a case
I crack heads more than base
Stack bread when I orchestrate, that said y'all the bass


No matter what the weather, we be getting our cheddar
So we can have a better tomorrow
Oh, money, cars, superstars, getting ours, working hard
For a better tomorrow


I seen niggas sniff coke through a crazy straw
Come out they shirts sweating bullets with the Bobby Brown jaw
Dry mouth, grinding back and forth plus he's steaming a Newport
We all holding the torch
Few staircase murders, some burners don't blam right
Guns that kicked around the wall you better stand tight
Full of X, AKs, whiling in lobbys, bulletproof PJs
Fuck around and get spunned like the DJ
CSI traumatized by viewing the instant replay
SpongeBob niggas get scars nigga
I'm off style in any section of the hood I'll pull your car nigga


No matter what the weather, we be getting our cheddar
So we can have a better tomorrow
Oh, money, cars, superstars, getting ours, working hard
For a better tomorrow


See ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
So you rather pursue death than admit defeat
See ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
So you rather pursue death than admit defeat


I used to be so narcissistic, park the whip and spark the biscuits
Spit hollow tipped shells at the Narcs with quickness
Live to tell the tale cause only God's my witness
Been a long time, change gonna come son, I'm optimistic
I hold the steel like Ron O'Neal
Super fly, do or die, Killah Hill, Brownsville
Never ran, never will, yes I can, yes I will
Put a dot upon your knot then I drill through your grill
Like a dentist, my apprentice speaks with a vengeance
Demented scientists count bodies inside the trenches
That's judges off the benches, got inches for y'all wenches
We plant those hot seeds that grow in cold winters


No matter what the weather, we be getting our cheddar
So we can have a better tomorrow
Oh, money, cars, superstars, getting ours, working hard
For a better tomorrow


See ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
So you rather pursue death than admit defeat
See ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
So you rather pursue death than admit defeat






Huh, after all these years, what you said was true
The Shaolin and the Wu-Tang is very dangerous

Hahahahahah


It's the ODB kid, once again coming through your area
And I'm going to tell you one time, you gon' love this


I had to get the money, said it wasn't a choice
Die Hard's on the bars, Ladies lovin' the voice
Morphine flow, numbing your joints
Bomb a nigga like he number 81 from Detroit
Zombie life, World War Z
Antidote to your virus, your highness, the world on me
Capital G, cool as the dude from Dos Equis
So deadly, I don't make it rain, I snow heavy
Sick lane, Nic Cage how I ride with fire
Forever with bars, sort of like a lifer
With the son of anarchy, I be breaking bad
Walking dead, day dreaming of making a band
Dancing with the stars, Americans idol me
The mentalist with the Big Bang Theory


Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


The most duplicated, anticipated, validated
Urban legends in the books with the ones who made it
Highly celebrated, everything was work related
Current top 40 got the Wu deep in all their business
20 years Killa Bees, yeah, we hold the pennant
Monumental stance on the cover with my co-defendants
Drop her sentence, in remembrance
Construct these jewels so they can live through my descendants


Youngun, I can see your draws, pull your pants up
Can't even call yourself a man until you man up
And if you call yourself a fan you need to stand up
This ain't a party, it's a jux, keep your hands up
And I don't care who runs the city when the summer come
Your summer's done, Wu forever, and we're still number one


Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


Picture a nigga on the strip getting rich off the drug shit
Putting other niggas on, teaching em thug shit
Then they want stick 'em up, then they get slugs quick
Hood-type niggas always living that crime life
Jealous-ass grimy niggas seeing the limelight
Slimy old nigga like fucking your mans wife
Fool shouldn't use the word brother, he man dyke


Yo, I spin my web all across New York
Get it out in all types of ice, there's a sport
One chain, two chain, three chain, four
Niggas mouth's drop like the leaves in the fall
Tone got that WBC
I take off heavy in air balloons and land in the Fiji's
That's my bird and that's my word
You faggots keep fucking around and get curbed
(I came to town)


Forms circles like the rings of Saturn
Dust rocks and ice in a particular pattern
Then this fascinating picture has emerged from surface
A wonder of the young world with an urgent purpose
A wild fire engulfing every home
It's history chiseled and carved in every stone
A workshop where skills are learned
Handcrafted and drafted, written works the main concern
Urban center provided with a social structure
And a curious culture full of superconductors
Each stain is part of a scene with
Intricate geometric raps on a larger screen
Spell bounding, marvelous and it's surrounding
Viewpoints remain the same, it's all astounding
A place where the forgotten art is so powerful
A striking image is something that's so valuable


This one's the blackout! Three-fifty-seven to your mouth!


GZA, this is called Ruckus In B Minor
Rae, all those bad times is behind us
Ghost, put that mask on to remind us
Method Man, let 'em know who's New York's finest


Youngun, I can see your draws, pull your pants up
Can't even call yourself a man until you man up
And if you call yourself a fan you need to stand up
This ain't a party, it's a jux, keep your hands up
And I don't care who runs the city when the summer come
Your summer's done, Wu forever, and we're still number one


Still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


Now I'mma let all you motherfuckers know
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga
I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker!


My lines is like Peruvian coke, go ahead and try one
My recipe is A1 remarkable with my mixture
Rainman mathematician, this city slicker
The finest threads cover my frame, the cloths of royalty
Strive with an army of winners and no pretenders
(*One*) We live free and achieve more
But first we gotta win with no stalemate
The all eye seeing is victorious biz to the sound man


Armored trucks, tanks are bulletproof, been the truth
Loot the track, clear the booth, my thought ready, aim, shoot
My knowledge one twenty proof, let's tear the roof off
Let's spray, M-A-S-T-A
King I Love-Love club, pack stadium rock
I hold the mic snug, split a slug
Black ninja, mask and gloves


Still number one, still number one





All you hoes, be cryin for these bitches
All you niggas, be cryin for these hoes

{*scratched samples*}

"Both hands clusty"

"Blew off the burner kinda dusty"

"We pack chrome TECs

"Bring it to em proper, potnah"
"Comin from the thirty-six chamber"

"Math, let the plate spin"

"Many brothers y'all be sparkin"

"Stray shots, all on the block that stays hot"

"If ya fuck with Wu, we gots ta fuck witchu"


Who the fuck knocked our buildings down?
Who the man behind the World Trade massacres, step up now
Where the four planes at huh is you insane bitch?
Fly that shit over my hood and get blown to bits!
No disrespect, that's where I rest my head
I understand you gotta rest yours true, nigga my people's dead
America, together we stand, divided we fall
Mr. Bush sit down, I'm in charge of the war!


Yes yes y'all, the I-N-S bless y'all
Stop hearts like cholesterol, let's brawl
Never fall, tear it down like a wreckin ball
Role call where my niggas that's one for all
And all for one, we draw the guns on impulse
Cash in the envelope, spend it on kinfolk
Then smoke a ounce as we count mills
Providin' you pure ecstasy without pills


Y'all know the rules, we don't fuck with fools man
How the fuck did we get so cool man?
Never ever disrespect my crew
If ya fuck with Wu we gots ta fuck witchu


Y'all dogs better guard ya grills, it's all real
We live from the Hills, it's the God I-Reelz
Yo Wonderful, spark the billz
Let me build with the people for the mills
I'm rollin with the Rebel I-Ill from Killa Hill, peace to Brownsville
Brothers that'll kill for the will of the righteous
Twenty-five to lifers, True and Livin' snipers
You wait like "Sixth Sense" 'til hard to kill


How you livin StreetLife? I'm surrounded by criminals
Serial killers tote guns without the serial
High-tech, street intellect, all digital
Project original, sheisty individual
New York's bravest, always supply you with the latest
We hall of famers, and still hit you with the greatest
Took a year hiatus, now you wanna hate us
Thanks to all you haters for all the cream you made us


Y'all know the rules, we don't fuck with fools man
How the fuck did we get so cool man?
Never ever disrespect my crew
If ya fuck with Wu we gots ta fuck witchu, nigga


Sendin letters to China, my cousin in Wendy's on Viacom
At home, it's worth money, I adorns
Order drinks, all real niggas order your minks yo
We got the fitteds on, lookin all fink
Daddy everybody get money from now on
Payday flash Visas livin like, Easter e'ryday
Don't fuck Benz, rather a 430
That shit that float through water, eyeball come up, drop birdies yo


We can eat right, or we can clap these toys
I'm with StreetLife, ain't never been a Backstreet Boy
Who y'all kiddin? Tryin to act like my shoe fittin
Confused with ya head up yo' ass like who's shittin?
It's Hot Nixon, same team same position
Battin average three-five-seven and still hittin
Y'all still bitchin, still lame and still chicken
I'm still here, one leg missin and still kickin
Cause I'm haaaaaaaaaaaard! Hard like a criminal
Lock like a tennis shoe, throw slug to finish you
It's the Method Man, for short Mr. Meth
I can tell this motherfucker ain't Wu, look at his neck


"Comin from the thirty-six chamber"
"Bring it to em proper, potnah"
"Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang"


It's Wu-Tang, rushin yo' gang, crushin the game
Pretty thugs, clutchin they chain, hand cuppin they thang

How the fuck did we get so cool man?
Never ever disrespect my crew
If ya fuck with Wu we gots ta fuck witchu nigga


I wish the nigga well
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang




Countdown...


Are you ready? Are you mad inside?
Got you strapped down to your seats
Outta the doorway, bullets ripped, full clip
God speed, approach follow my lead
Fire winds gust, empire crush
Full thrust, fall in the hole, roll wit the rush
Untouchable chunk of earwax and soul
Sound waves slay out the bat cave smoke
My belly-full prance dance, avalanche quote
Down slope, elegant as Fantasia
Killer whale tale inhale, black male from Asia
All out the wood works, hood shirts and wizards
No match, unhatch, the rap is rigid
In the shaft, shotty cocked, hip hop to the limit
Nightwatch, pad mark
Sparks spin a quake nuclear blast, heavy on the cash
Gimmie what it takes NOW!!

Chorus  2x
RAGE ROCK ROLL FIGHT
BRAWL FALL RUMBLLLLLLEEE!!!


The diabolic witty, dialect's darker than Gotham City
With the possibility to stop your walkin ability
God forgive me, spark enemies with pistol grips
The missile tip's impact hit you so hard, you shit through your dick
Official scripts strikes when physical hits
You physical bitch, watch for the imperial blitz, serious shit
Submit, subject to the wreck war tone, and thought poems
Liver than WWF Warzone
Walk upon them Gotti tracks, bodies collapse
Rap for lottery stacks, shatter like when pottery cracks
Logical facts from the terror dome
Spill from the guts, trail to you ?puss? from where you bust
In God you now entrust
Dog you like hound and mutts, Pound Pups get sound struck
Clown what? You'll get drowned in the cut
While crowd round up

 (x2)


A-yo, yo;
I spit bars, travelling tremendous speed measuring far
Been busting satellites circling Mars
Verbal onslaught, bring forth physical force
Of a hundred wild niggas piled in a Trojan Horse
Thought method, set it on generic mic ethic
Professional neck shit, left foes beheaded
This music, is mind control like computer chips
Been doing this for numerous years, refuse to lose it
With turbo tactics, maneuver like a trained soldier
Hall of Fame flame thrower, take game, it's game over
Ayatollah, high roller nine totter
Mind controller, 2009 time folder
My coalition, bring the demolition
Wu-blade decision, slate the competition, wit no intermission
Spitting hazardous darts, up front like Rosa Parks
Makin million men march

 (x2)


Yo, who got next? Meth got next
I chin check, all these MC's line em up god, I go Jihad
Declare holy war, it be hard to dip and dodge
Police squads trying to bogard, we rip and rob
The boulevard ain't safe for your kids, that's how it is
In the ghetto, we ain't scared to death, but scared to live
So Goldy, mosey to the spot, get that moldy
Rusty-ass .38 Special, niggas owe me
Slowly I turn, face the one and only
Naughty By Nature, I Do My Dirt All By My Lonely
Ask Pretty Tony, when I got a bitch I keeps a bitch
36 Chambers, Enter at your own risk
Take that watch off and tuck your necklace
City never sleeps, streets is restless
Rap style'll slave you, when you least expect it
Pull the plug on your respirator, leave you breathless
Wu-Tang forever and a day, better warn your boys
I deploy battleship rap, seek and destroy

Chorus 2x




Oh, Oh, Oh, Come On, Come On, Come On
Mutha What? Muthafucka
That's Right, All Day, All Night
Come On, Get Down, Yes Y'all And
To The Right Beat And You Can Even Dance
Or, Just Have A Seating, Seating
Yo, Yo, Yo

What It Was, What It Is, It's Like I Got A Pistol
To My Head, Can I Live? You Never Should Of Left Tical For Dead
Never That, Be Careful What You Wish For
Today's Your Day To Get Yours
Blowin' Up The Spot From The Sixth Floor, Bent Off
Come And Get Your On Smoke On, Fish Funk To Choke On
Go 'head, Blaze A Pound Of That Bullshit We Both On
Take It The 'source', 'hip Hop Quotable', Of Course
I'm Pullin' Out My 'roots', To Breathe In My 'black Thought'
Let's Be Honest, I Break A Spirit, If She Break A Promise
They Act Just Like They Momma's, Now What That Got To Do
With The Price Of Rice In China
Or Why These Gold Miners Raise The Price On They Vagina
Now Frankly, I'm Official, New York Yankee
You Can Blame The Radio Stations That's Trynna Yank Me
And Jerk The Jabber Jaw Shark Bitten Flow
Go 'head, Test The Water, My Friend, Stick In Your Toe


Rush, The Colisseum, Rush, The Dance Floor
Rush, The Limosine, Rush, Don't Let Go
And Jerk The Jabber Jaw Shark Bitten Flow
Go 'head, Test The Water, My Friend, Stick In Your Toe
Whoa-Ho-Ho, Let Me Like, Solo With The Flow
Whoa-Ho-Ho, Promoter Better Pay Me At The Door
Whoa-Ho-Ho, What The Fuck Y'all Think I'm Flowin' For
If I Move To Quick, Oh, You Just Don't Know

The Sound Echoed Through The Neighborhood And Vibrate
Circulate Eruptions Throughout The Tri-State
The Wise They Attract To It, Cuz It's Magnetic
Those Slow Kids, Stuck On The Block, They Don't Get It
But, They Don't Wanna Set It, Track On Immedietly
Quick Fast, Clock Tick To The Blast Machine
The Bugged Out, They Scatter When The Lights On
We Raid Those Local Spots, Til We Turn The Mics On
Rollin' With The Talent, The Beats, And Rap Verse
The Crowd Get Excited, With The Heat And Clap First
Must Of Had A Hot Hand To Go In His Waist Band
Set He Had To Lick A Shot For A Top Notch Clan
Multiple Swordsmen, Blade Sharp
Rip Through Your Heart, M.C.'s, Want No Part
For Any Type Of Conflict, Or Nonsense, Then We Respond Quick
It Get Thick, The Problem, Goes Beyond Sick



Let The Record Show, Never Test My Flow
Never Tested Positive For Blow
Got My Whole Life Ahead Of Me, No Time To Be Sniffin'
Soon As Muthafuckas Get Dough, They Act Different
But Not Nixon, Let The Pot Call The Kettle Black, But Not In My Kitchen
And Y'all Fixin', To Be On Milk Cartoons Missing
In The Double Xl, Supreme Clientele
Since Then I Have No Birthday, My Sign's Not For Sale
If I Had A Dollar, For Every Time M.C.'s Tried To Holla
Brag About Dough, And Pop They Collar
I'd Probably Be A Zillionaire, Like, 'fuck Rapping And Rappers'
Cut The Drama, We Don't Like The Way Y'all Actin'
Eat, Drink And Smoke Mary, Mr. Meth's Rated X
By Any Means Necessary (Come On)
It Ain't Easy Being Greasy, In The Main Event Now
Catch Me On Your Pay-Per-View Tv






Yo, yo, yo, what up kid? Yo, these niggas is back, son
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) I'm telling you, spit that, done it nigga
Yeah... yeah... yeah, yeah, I seen it like a Zenith, man
You hear me man? Word up, man, ya'll know what it is
It's on again, man, for real, Top Gun, what what


Aiyo, we came through thumping like elephants
The new Range is super-charged, I remains intelligent
Back to the formula, lord, hard grammar
This is God school, make sure the lobby ain't jammed up
Excalibur swords, T-Rexes, bibles of rhymes
We in the lunchroom, weed and veggies for breakfast
Polo campus, sicker lances, the crisp
Hundred dollar kick niggas, that be showing you hand steps
Back to the dormatory, where niggas
Broke my forearm and index finger, now you write glory
True holding my flag, it's all engraved in my blade
So when I wave it, you gon' say Rae mad
Now it's 28 Days Later, now Wu's up, do something, you can't
It's blood in my eye, I might get amped
To rip something down, the billboard holders is back
So when you see me, you gon' say he gets down


From darkness to DNA, I move with my brother
And we resonate, energy that shifts in colors
Bringing MC's punishment, then I'm done with it
The meter leave way on the fast break, I run with it
It was not a hobby, but a childhood passion
That had started in the lobby and was quicky fashioned
Every line to line, bar for bar is clockwork
Hazardous and powerful enough to have your block hurt
Check the total amount of MC's inflicted
With torture, from moving with work that's restricted
We criticize producers til they joints are right
Then acupuncture the track with pinpoints of light
Hitting them from well conceiled firing positions
With explosiveness that'll make the deaf listen
Drastic, pyroclastic, connected with the same old
Down the dangerous slopes of an active volcano


Blitz like the Green Bay Packers, sack like the linebackers
Hang with niggas, like redneck crackers
Strangle cold bottles of Beck's, like a vexed German
Duck low behind the car, my tech burning
Neck burning, from eight karats of sunlight
Absorbed, in the grill, Big Pun like
Lord of the Wu-Tang sword, know what that means?
Like J.R. Tolkien, it's the Lord of the Rings
This is my man, Chef, auto, like Grand Theft Auto
The 18th letter, followed by the mark of Zorro
Plus A, not for apple, but I pack an apple
Shorty try to buck back, and knock me off the saddle
Caramel, pecan, sundae, Pregline
Plump breasts, was filled with saline
Her big booty cousin, nasty Nadine
Get you on the floor, whore tried to double team


Is he still that nucca? Is he in the hood like that?
Is he really strapped? Will he really split yo' shit?
I thought you said he rap? Pull up in the yard, ten sets
He ain't flexing, microphone ripping, heat holding
Who testing? Rope-a-dope his black lotus
Can't quote this, chat with the sword tongue
Duck when the axe is swinging, wild Apache drum
Crazy Horse kicking his thoughts, he won't quit
Can't tell 'em nothing, he grown, give the man room
Space was demanded, beat banging through the speaker
Voice, heat seek missle, guided at the listener
Swing to the gospel, catch up and wet at the brothel
Unstoppable, direction of my flow, optional
To the ear, depending on the current of air, the crowd's in




As I walk in the shadow of death
16 men on a dead man's chest
Your host this eve
Mister H-O-T
N-I-X ya get splashed with the tec'
No body go till the God say so
You got a second M-O
To run for the dough
Before I blow back off the math contact
You didn't know stack coz you down like that


And when I get that feeling
I can no longer slide
I can no longer run, oh no no
And when I get that feeling
I can no longer hide
For there's no longer fall, oh no no


All day every day


Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same
About you
And you can tell me your reasons
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same about you


See my pinky
See my thumb
See that kid with the pump-shot-gun
Mister Mef, hold the fort most def
Cats is dead wrong
Song's too long
Mister-Big Mouth, could that be tra'
You need to dish out your style
No doubt
Shaolin strut through the Shaolin slum
Rum-pum-pum on ma Shaolin drum


And when I get that feeling
I can no longer slide
I can no longer run, oh no no
And when I get that feeling
I can no longer hide
For there's no longer fall, oh no no


All day every day


Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same
About you
And you can tell me your reasons
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same about you](1429601)


I've said good night
Tried to sleep tight
One time for you crooked ass
Two time for your crooked ass
I just dream of being
Go close your eyes cause I've closed mine
Three time for your crooked ass, wuh
Four time for your crooked ass
Ahhhh, will you dream of me
Yeahhhh


Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind

About you

But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same about you](1429601)


Yeah, you can say what you want
But it won't change my mind
I'll feel the same about you
(Momma used to say be a ladies man)
And you can tell me your reasons
But it won't change my feelings
I'll feel the same about you](1429601)
(All day, every day)

If you slip up get up what up when you step up to challenge
Staten Island, in the balance
What up, you smilin'
You better check yo' cal-en-der
For the Methtical slug, uh uh

John John Blazini
All day every day, with the souffle'
All you cats got to react, to jump back
Kiss yourself, 'fore you get smacked
By the my appa-ra-tus comin' through with the stat-us
Connect-in', lethal weapon, lethal injection
Visual unseen, like gene
When I had men, I'm unforgiven
Locked in prison, in the Wu-Tang dirty dungeon
You should come into my 12 bar dirty dozen
Love you to death now, kiss of death
Every body wants to do what they gotta do, to breath, try to eat
Your minds on the rhymin', dancin', runnin' in money
They get dope biz, step in the square, cats 'n' Clan over here
Playas'
Yeah, an' it's all G-O-NEE
Hehe




*weather and* *always*
Damn man these radio stations be bugging
It's three o'clock in the morning
Damn, this hip hop shit just keep it
They gotta slow this shit down man, you know what I mean?


Fiends were never waiting in the hill
They ran one step ahead
But the jiggy was always there
Upon the project pavement
There was death, enslavement of the mind
Single mothers are filled with stress
As I lay there with my baby
We would look, from the window, and cry
Then suddenly in the sky
Between the new world ages
We were blessed, and Wu-Tang fills the ear
With the melody of a train (Lord is suddenly here!)


False MC's are melting in the dark, all the weak LP's are
Going dowwwwwwwwwwwwwn
God released the tape out, early May
And, I don't think the world can take it
Cause it took so long to make it
And the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmmmme

Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang


Upon the project pavement
There was death, enslavement of the mind
Single mothers are filled with stress
Between the new world ages
We were blessed, and Wu-Tang fills the air
With the knowledge that God posses
As I lay there with my baby
We would look, from the window, and cry
Then the Wu-Tang sign appears, in the sky


Billboards started melting in the dark, all the weak MC's are
Going dowwwwwwwwwwwn
God released the tape of, Earthly pain
And, I don't think the world can take it
Cause it took so long to make it
And the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmme
And I don't think the world can take it
Cause it took so long to make it
And the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmme


Hey, hey, hey
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang




I despise your killing and raping
You're despicable (Are you my judge?)
It's just you should be punished
I'm gonna chop off your arm, so are you ready?


Check these high hats sling tings moving through the rubbish
Party robust, rec room style for you brothers
Time's ticking, erupt misconduct
Entering one funk before the drum dry up
Dial, style, jab vocab slow
Alphabet run, construction voice might blow
Tap dance swelling Hemingway novel model
For a breather, dirty reefer hide your bottle
Cut down, come with something that's round and profound
Blood brothers, people of colors, we get down
Watch this fly, force feed things being said
Nine Diagram acid black evil red leathers
Mic half a dangle, serious a man
My mic clapper death wish, everlasting plan
Heavenly God body, know me as the cleaner
Night champion, old villain style seamer
Kiss a spider, Seagal saga why bother
Godfather talk drama, fly swatters


Number two, Chao San Poi


This Wu shit be hard to kill and full blown
Rhymes filtered through the net before words hit the chrome
Pro tools editing tracks that's rough
Cause a jam without a live MC isn't enough
So we attack this and grab all within reach
Throw a scrap back to niggas,perfect your own speech
Shit is copper, it ain't worth the mic stands
Used by backup singers in Atlantic City bands
Niggas look on and get hooked on this mic line
Reeled in and shipped through the pipeline
LPs delivered with style and potential
Niggas flowing smoothly in a sequential
Order, revealing hidden tape recorders
Stashed inside pockets of those who lack aura


Twist the DAC up, them niggas with math is back up
Watch he act up, fifty-two block track we slap up
Playground manoeuvre, jet to Vancouver like this
Two Kahluas one chick, she's German Luger
Get the shit on, light a fresh pack, bust it open
With the seal on Dunn, deal on this, with the real on
Necks rocky ring, call it the Decatur
Slang soufleer home decorater, player
Mic immigrants, nine of us formed resemblance
Somethin flashy, God dead-armed is nasty
Peep the ornaments enough to make Shorty-Wop stare at me yo
He killed the God might as well throw a chair at me


Yo MC's wonder what's Hip Hop thunder
Tell you the truth it's just one nation under a groove
Gettin down for the funk of it
Like Fred Sanford in the biz...
Yo inhale this paraphernalia, a Wu memorabilia
Melba the fortune teller, tried to tell ya
Bout the group recruit we scoop up CREAM like Breyer's
Then spread across the globe like telephone wires
Thirty-six assorted, Shaolin imported
Chambers been recorded, you're fuckin with the loops
Time for royalty audit
Fabulous establishment metabolism, Blackfoot Indian
Cherokee started out smaller than amphibian
Then grew to a physical body with five meridians
As the pendulum swings closer to the millenium
Two thousand, wickedness is spread amongst my citizen
I got a muscle the industrial to make a hustle
And politic with Lyor and Russell
When niggas is still rushin we'll brush you


He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives


Thoughts are contained in the trenches of the brain
Ignite, blowing the mic to Arabian heights
As I recite this medley, niggas couldn't fuck with the
Deadly ground I hold down
Classical gangland style, shots hit the ceiling
Panic and confusion echoes through the building
Continuing to build, I strive for perfection
Driven by the will to live, Glocks I hold
Shots I give, while searchers of rescue teams
Look for means of survival and who's liable
For this harrowing experience
You scream for the extreme, fiend for the cap
And proceeds of the Wu-Tang Academy
To fuck up your anatomy with assault and battery


Number two, Chao San Poi
Number two, Chao San Poi
He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives
Number one, Yen Chang Wa
He's an adulterer, don't trust him
Number two, Chao San Poi
Number two, Chao San Poi
He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives
I despise your killing, and raping
You're... despicable
Are you, my judge?
It's just... you should be punished
I'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?
I despise your killing, and raping
You're... despicable
Are you, my judge?
It's just... you should be punished
I'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?

With hockey pucks and skateboards on the way to Woodstock
Leave home the Glock

Shoot planets, don't get frantic, throw your hands up in the air
Don't panic
Supreme arm, leg, leg, arm, head

Murder, taste the flame of the Wu-Tang, rah!

I react so thick, I'm phat, and yo

So, when you see me on the real
Formin' like Voltron, remember I got deep like a Navy Seal

Aint nonone of them niggas cant fuck with me
What? Nigga you could never fuck with me, my nigga
Ill fuck you up right now! What?! What?! What?!
Bust your motherfucking ass boy!
I ain't no motherfucking joke, you know who you talking to?
Ol' Dirty Bastard, you know what Im sayin'?
I fuck you up right now
Yeah! What?! What?! What?!


I'm the one-man army, Ason
I never been tooken out
I keep MCs looking out
I drop science like girls be dropping babies
Enough to make a nigga go crazy
In the G-Building, taking all types of medicines
Your ass thought you were better than
Ason, I keep planets in orbit
While I be coming with deeper and more shit
Enough to make you break and shake your ass
As I create rhymes good as a Tastykake makes
This style, I'm mastered in
Niggas catching headaches
What? What? You need Aspirin?
This type of pain, you couldn't even kill with Midol
Fuck around, get sprayed with Lysol
In your face like a can of mace, baby
Is it burning? Well, fuck it, now you're learning
How I don't even like your motherfucking profile
Give me my fucking shit: CH-CH-BLAOW!
Not seen and heard, no-one knows
You forget: niggas be quiet as death
Now you know nothing
Before you knew a whole fucking lot
Your ass don't wanna get shot
A lot of MCs came to my showdown
And watched me put your fucking ass low down
As you can go, below zero
Without a doubt I never been tooken out
By a nigga, who couldn't figure
Yo by a nigga, who couldn't figure
Yo by a nigga, who couldn't figure (Brooklyn Zoo)
How to pull a fucking gun trigger
I said "Get the fuck outta here!"


I'm not playing
I'm not playing
I'm not playing with you, yeah!


Nigga wanna get too close, to the utmost
But I got stacks that'll attack any wack host
Introducing - yo fuck that nigga's name
My Hip Hop drops on your head like rain
And when it rains it pours, cause my rhymes hardcore
That's why I give you more of the raw
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Whoa-hoa-hoa! Let me like slow up with the flow
If I move too quick, oh, you just won't know
I'm homicidal when you enter the target
Nigga get up, act like a pig trying to hog shit
So I take yo ass out quick
The mics, I've had it my nigga, you can suck my dick
If you wanna step to my motherfucking rep
CH-CH-BLOAW! BLOAW! BLOAW! Blown to death


I'm not playing
I'm not playing
I'm not playing with you, yeah!


You got shot cause you knock knock knock
"Who's there?" Another motherfucking hardrock

Shame on you, when you step through to

"Who's the knucklehead wantin respect?" -- Ghostface
{sample repeats in background of Street's intro}


Yo, yo; Never doubt the Life
(EHHHH! YO!) Yo
Who the fuck are you to criticize me?
Yo, I slap, yo, I slap dick ta ya wifey
Yo (respect, that's my word)


Another Wu tradition, Street vision, listen
All my life I've been poverty stricken
Always took what's mines, never was given
A second chance just to rap sheet a bad decision
You can't knock the hustle or the life that I'm livin
Quick to stick the clip in, blow you out position
Street juridictions, nigga, no restriction
Concrete composition for emcee's in submission
Special edition crash course mission
Push through like the task force and crush all competition
See you from a distance, dry snitchin, whisperin
Greet your man posted up like two little bitches
When you get the heart, step live or catch stitches
Or find yourself with Del, sleepin with the fishes
I got no love for fans that's fake ass niggas
I can't stand the bid when it's all in my business
Wu-Tang Forever and a day, don't get it twisted
I get lifted, I just shoot somethin from hot buscuit
These street kids, we can't lost, we terrorize you district
Leave no finger prints and no survivin witness


Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
(Yo, yo Math!)
It's them kids from the otherside "Shaolin" Worldwide
Street Life, Homocide, nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide, boo, we P.L.O
Fo' sho', if it don't flow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it don't blow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it ain't dough, gotta go
Some didn't listen 'til my gun went BLOW!


Yo, thoughts sharper than a Japanese Kitana
Ninja coma, pirahnas crack teeth on my armor
Scadalous, I ran contra-bomber, stalker like rebels of Rwanda
Death before dishonor, snake charmer, persona of one who makes drama
Godfather 4 type saga, tuckin a revolver in my Parker
Bombin unprepared for departure, might talk but strike harder
Fear the bow of the silent archer
Sure shotter, pass the rock to your starter
Poison darter, news photographers document the horror
While I bounce Shaunda with Tiwana and I from blue Honda
Honorable scholar, rockwilder, rip mic's for top dollar
Your highnes, the crowd hollar
Got your head rock, feel the brain trauma
Crowd sponser, hotter than Bahama steam saunas
The Rebel of opera, popped off the choclate and the ?gosha?
Monster truck crush you imposters


Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
It's them kids from the otherside "Shaolin" Worldwide
I.N.S., Homocide, nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide, boo, we P.L.O
Fo' sho', if it don't flow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it don't blow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it ain't dough, gotta go
Some didn't listen 'til my gun went BLOW!


I'm the four mic emcee with five mic potential
Overlooked cuz y'all can't understand what I been thru
You ain't got to love me, or even pretend to
Actin like the street, they ain't got no street credentials
Crack villians, raps be killin instrumentals
The caps pealin and slap a feelin out ya dental
Underground, sound, for ghetto residentials
Up shit's creek lookin for some more shit to get into
Got the Clan jewels as I continue
To serve you everythin on that's on the menu
With Chef John Jacob
Remember Sunz Of Man told you Wake Up?
My nigga smell the coffee, I'm too hardcore to kill softly
Come to free the mind and get the bullshit up off me
The Jedi, only use The Force if ya force me
Shaolin What? Don't get it fucked up and cross me
Rappers gettin stuck for actin stuck up and flossy
Say it ain't so! Bust the callico
Rap from the Island called Stat', here we go


Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
It's them kids from the otherside "Shaolin" Worldwide
Method Man, Homocide, nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide, boo, we P.L.O
Fo' sho', if it don't flow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it don't blow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it ain't dough, gotta go
Some didn't listen 'til my gun went BLOW!

If the 85 are in the sheep state of mind, right?
They still B-rain in the sheep state of mind
It's just, which way are you leadin the sheep?
Off the cliff?
Or to some grazin grass so it can grow
And have a full productive life?






When I'm locked down I use Timbs as my shower slippers
I'm in the background mingling with the powder flippers
In the basement, hard-body power lifters
I crush sour in the sifter, see how I lift her
Universal God I stay scientific
The kid with the Golden Arms, Iron Fisted
Stay Asiatic, so cinematic
Noise in the attic, bang out with them automatics
It's hood politics that bring the hunger back
I'm straight chopping wood, call me the lumberjack
Check the catalog put out a hundred packs
Watch for drug sniffing dogs they coming from the back
I'm straight thunder clap the funky drummer's back
It's pure Dopium, give em a heart attack
I stay stacking plaques like ancient artifacts
Joe Namath in the game I'm the quarterback


Eight balls of coke, blunt to the greenery
Pounds in the trunk get you a concrete scenery
Handmade ox'll get you dumped in the mess hall
Snitch niggas run to C.O.s to confess all
This is street knowledge, knowledge I school college
Like a speech from the GZA, sharp like the RZA
Don't run with a scissor, nigga the truth is the
Truth, now I'mma drop a few jewels in the booth
Used to boot crack, stuff em inside a tennis ball
Ans throw it when they rushing the block, trust no cops
Driving around with two mitts in my socks
Cooked coke gon' get you in more trouble than money
Don't crawl through dust juice the pigs is hungry
You think they ain't watching
They watching while you uptown copping
Back home while you're cooking and chopping
They scheming on the block waiting to get it popping


He had a sword and an axe with cuts
Under a road that was woven from silver and gold, waxed it up
His army was so great in quantity
His crops and livestock boost the economy
Many would travel by boat to see him
His image adorned most schools and coliseums
A merchant, hustle those silk and velvets
Portrait illuminated when the torch was well-lit
Picture so beautifully painted that
One thought it would breathe or move cause it would leave a mood
Or energy, you see his wife practiced Yoga
Made herbal enhancers that had saved the soldiers
Guard the treasures in the chambers, halls and vaults
Well-prepared for all assaults
Heavy guarded village
Armed with the sharpest weapons designed to pierce and cause blood spillage


From a young teen, a murder team, inspired by crime
See Allah Just granted permission for my position
Sit down, write rhymes, escaping this repetitive cycle
Slinging dimes, losing time, doing hard time
Teaching y'all mathematically, come see
The epitomy of what you wanna be - emcee
My semi-auto gun mandatory at the sound clash
The mic touched, dance mashed up, pounds of the best
Green glass bottles of don, I sip the liquor slow
Flow so devastating when I go solo
Even when I'm dolo, pretty gun I'm holding
Head swollen off the solid gold soul
Iron Mic pole beat your face like you stole something, trust me
Living life royalty, all wise and healthy
Welcome to the best of me, from knowledge to infinity
Never stopping my projectory, I'm galactic


Yo, peace to all of the gods and all of the earths
We been building like this ever since the first day of birth
The more I start to build, the better I feel
Keep ignorant niggas from me, use dummies for shield
You're not Godbody son, you're just garbage and real snotty
Cherry head gaylord still stuck in the lobby
This the first Now Born, son I'm blessed with mad lessons
Conquered crazy devils, my mind is a weapon
You can't fast with me and avoid the swine
You degenerate emcee, I'm the best of mankind
Allahu Akbar straight jewels and real stars
I'm down with the RZA, got help for the Widow's Son
Pop off on you, you ain't nothing to me - DUN DUN
Original Tyzeem, Holy water, Visine
Designated wordplay, God respect my deen
Shine on little stars and respect the Queen


New York Giant, call me Deck Umenyiora
Fresh with the water connect, two and a quarter
Deal with the dealer, don't trust the transporter
My job is done once I get it to the border
Perico, coke game is kilos of cocaine
Hypodermic needle to the groove, I dose veins
Overdoser, you know the product is raw right
Lines take you there like I wrote it with off-white
Got him bent up, hands looking like a tin cup
Sorry no consignment, get your ends up
Move from the gate now, he on his way straight to Jake now
I'm on the hush with my weight loud
Got the shakes now, how they want it bad
Five or six heads chipping in for a bag
I got the works like a burger deluxe
Get your fix while I'm serving it up, word to us






I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
At second hands, moms bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, rocking the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I be getting the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son, rolling with this one and that one
Pulling out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smoking woolas at 16
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-tight clique and went all out
Catching keys from across seas
Rolling in MPV's every week we made forty G's
Yo brothers respect mine or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-POW, move from the gate now


I'm so tired, sheep are counting me
No more struggle, no more energy


It's been twenty-two long hard years of still struggling
Survival got me bugging, but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck selling drugs and such who never had much
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not touch
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacing - going upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned I learned life is hell
Living in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes giving chase, selling base
Smoking bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed and I ask what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained working hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks and
Stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be living proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's running wild, smoking sess, drinking beer
And ain't trying to hear what I'm kicking in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic


I'm so tired, sheep are counting me
No more struggle, no more energy
No more patient, you can write that down
It's all to crazy, I'm not sticking around



Now number two, practiced the snake style
He was known as the snake spirit
He had the speed of a snake


Niggas is like serpents out there

Serpents will bite
Lay outside, and then they roll back into they holes
They slither, in the streets of Brooklyn, New York
Slither in the streets, of Manhattan
In the streets of Queens, streets of the Bronx
Streets of Staten Island
Wherever you see em they slither
Whoever... yo
Fearsome shit... check it out
Yo, yo


It broke me up when they pat me on my shoulder
Said stay strong cuz his life is now over
I flash back to the heathens that he roll with
They shot him up and down nobody knows shit
My peers, little ears
Came up to me with a eye full of tears
Last night we was shootin dice and gettin nice
Kid rolled us, played us for our merchandise
We were in the hallway all day
Me, Steve and Little Ray
Probably at first they tried to rob me
Back me in the lobby, pull out the shotty
Then came Scotty, fragile body
My first impression, he returned from a party
He would just stagger, smellin like Bacardi
The Dragon, braggin, how he was fuckin mad hotties
Pressed on the elevator button, then all of a sudden
He licked off, about a dozen
Slugs from the cannon, that ripped through my cousin
Nobody was standing when the nigga started bustin
Blood started to flood the floors by the elevator doors
That's the last thing that I saw
Damn, we planned to make grands and buy a home




Jagged edge, rockin God, hard as Stonehenge
Pledged whoever crossed his path get scrapped with a sledge..
..hammer, he didn't give a damn about the manner
And on the block he was called by the momma's
And the grandma's, 'indecent', 'heathen', 'juvenile delinquent'
His weekends was frequently locked inside the precinct
His most recent cape for catchin papes
Was snatchin up snakes on a roof butt-naked hang em off like drapes
Then ask what's the combination to the safe, with the brace
And those who didn't reply they fell straight to their face
Razor blade sharp who invades the dark
And raid more spots than Spays and NARCS iron heart like Tony Starks
A fierce lion, who never leave the crib without the iron
And on the block he be slingin rocks and duckin from the sirens
Greetin niggas he loved with a pound, and a bear hug
Those who wanted life, they catch a slug from the snub
A Five Percent, who all knew was one to ten
He loved the Gods with his heart but his brain was filled with sin
And when he came through niggas be lookin out
Hopin he gets shot or tooken out, or locked the fuck up in Brooklyn House
In PC, on a liquid diet, but he was louder than a riot



Do the knowledge to a nigga named Trigga
Bad rude boy from the land of Jamaica
With visions to venture, to the U.S
To receive the gold that he couldn't acheive
In his country, even though he sold mad weed
For the next man, who was the Don of the clan
Niggas actin like they got the block locked
Like I can't sling drug raps and eat food
But I be the rudest, bad boy steppin gun totin
Shots lash out like a violent explosion
At the nigga, who tries to stop my production
Intervene the scene and slow up the cream
None of that black, East New York, gun talk
Niggas I extort from Baltic to Boardwalk
Memories of injuries wounds and burns
Walkin' through the streets of Medina I stand firm
Cause I know this, which means I can hold mine down
Without a doubt, niggas who front, get snuffed out
Justice must be born there's no escape
Cause a snake can't be reformed so I wait
Comin' in the name to proclaim your fame for protection
And you don't know no fuckin' lessons?



Bad, bad, Leroy Brown
Baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than the deep blue seaaaaa
Badder than you and meeeeee
Niggas comin thru the trees, like a salamander, bitin'
Like a piranha, but I'm bitin' you back, like a black pantha
The style I'm ampin' the... fuck my name, who I be?
Fuck the game, it's all about the moneyyyy!
Owahhaerahh, sometimes I get high with the Meth
Then I turn to the Killah Priest
When it comes TWELVE O'CLOCK!!
I turn into the demon beast, yo
Yo fuck that shit!

YO! SHOW THESE MOTHERFUCKERS WHAT TIME IT IS
 Rawwrarrrah
Rahhwarwaahauh, rawwaroar!!
WHO's THE BAD-ASS? *rawharrah*
WHO's THE BAD-ASS?
 Rawwwaahrah
[He practiced the snake style
He was known as the snake spirit] YEAHhhhhh


Lyrics, never waitin, twelve days, penetrated
When I come with the ruffness, mad niggas try to rush this
Slip into my killings, then I slays and you're helpless
When I try to stay sick, it's yacub grafted six
Calm for the kill, knowing the style that's ill
When I drop, lyric skills, brothers say, Buddah chill!!


I don't need to rhyme no more, niggas know, yo!

The Ghostface Killer, the GZA, the RZA, the Ol' Dirty Bastard

Y'all niggas is fake - all y'all do is steal from us
Remember this line, I'm that nigga word to my mother
Slap one of y'all fake ass niggas
Reefer from Egypt daddy we rock magnums
All big niggas heavy on the wrist play diss niggas
Ghost story blow 'em, RZA throw the fork through 'em
Me, Wonder Woman cousin, jewelried out, talk to him
Hammers that bust endlessness, cover terrorism what?
Slide in the 7, measure the whips

I'm a dollar and a dream from seein a brick
In grimy hallways, slingin nicks and treys
When it's on then it's on and poppin, shots lickin
I'm spittin this shit for the hood, Glock clickin
Tension in the street, we stressed, still wanna eat
I walk through the valley of death, the hotstepper
Holdin red pepper, everybody on reach
I need a beat to expand, the mind guide the hand
Pen stroke, excellent quotes of literature
Nights over Egypt, black as Arabia
Gundeliro self I savior, I need the (uh)

Aiyyo, aiyyo
Aiyyo I got the whip smellin like lemon
Roger Clemens jerseys the man blew seven cold coolies in the Worthy and
I crush those rappers, keep the toast near the rad-iator
We like our guns warm, it's easier to make the papers
Stayed off, the cape came off, Ghost G'd off
The track's like doin six months and I'mma beat off
At the airport attention always flow in my direction like
You let the best then sparkle his perfection and
Bitches be askin them, Ghost you got so much shit
You need to cash in, bracelets matchin 'em


Yo, yo
Line Cadillacs to blocks, Richard Pryor, Redd Foxx
Jukebox records, flatfooted cops
Get automatic systematic jumpin in your socks
Mama's apple pie in the park hopscotch
Reunited on the radio, Wu-Tang superb
In the sprinklers girls double-dutchin on the curb
Sinatra, the pop the Jackson 5 recordings
Uptown Saturday, "Cotton Came to Harlem"
Ringmaster circus was, Bailey and Barnum
Crack a Coca-Cola, summer heat was my boredom
Dr. J before Jordan, Al Green on the organ
When Rerun did the dance, the whole world saw him
The blackout fears, Foxxy Brown, Pam Grier

"Since you're all so skilled
Let's fight your way - Shaolin style. Come on!"




Yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah...
Let's go...
Yeah, listen...


The sound of the horns says it's on
We storm through like C. Thomas, Red Dawn
Step like a don through the city, Deck bonds
I get my hands dirty, Nikes scuffed, sweat pouring
Still I stay fresh with the fly white linen
Duece times 5, that's my type women
Sonny, I live it, O-10, S5 tinted
Brother Deck, what I rep, S.I., dig it?
Fifty cal' flow, get low
Intro to outro, bout it tho, whoa
Steady, heavy like a '52 Chevy
Niggas ain't ready, I turn out your lights like Teddy
Roll like dice in the casino
Known to spit lava, Heat like DeNiro and Pacino
Manifesto, Wu-Tang Gambino
Lay it down, then I fly off like the hero

"Wu-Tang!"
"Wu-Tang!"


The Wild Cowboy number one
G-O-D, how you gonna block out the son?
Read my jacket, my achievements stretch like a warning track catch
The in-crazable voice box, I throw you boys rocks
Diamonds and jewels, a holiday, pros that fuck in schools
I'm a tank, I stop panzers, take down stanzas
Sixteen bars, keep the car running
Broads stunting, feed ya self, kill ya self, take the pill
Punks jump up to get beat down
New York the sweet town I sorta, who's on tour?
Who the vile, truth can say, you ain't a slouch
Now Rule local, now I'm B.K. vocal
Right out the X, you can work out your pecs and your back
Can beat the death with bats, need to tune up, NJ'll turn the tune up
I'mma tell you who's soon enough to got
And I ain't down with getting crossed, and I never been the boss

"Wu-Tang!"


Yo, you're hog-tied, I'm roping them, bitches, I'm gropping them
Open up your veins, cop three bags of Dopium
Super soak these niggas, stroke with the magnum force
Leak it in the streets quick, peep my secret sauce
I keep it gloss, I'm suited up for my franchise
Your coins is tossed, man-handle bad guys
Scramble for my damn prize, crack cans of cold Guinness
I'm like Seabiscuit, I'mma win by a photo finish
Nigga, this ain't tennis, yeah, I ain't bluffing shit
I be the street menace on my David Ruffin shit
Police ain't cuffing shit, claiming I'm a crook
Throw up my middle finger, I'm a hall of famer in my book
Right hook, death jooks, great with my footwork
Bubble through, got the W on my hood shirt
Sneak through the wood works like poisonous high fumes
I'm that superhero with the brand new costume

"Wu-Tang!"
"Wu-Tang!"
"Wu-Tang!"
"Wu-Tang!"



 + (Tash Mahogany)
She's my number one gangsta chick (my starter) She's my number one starter chick
She's my number one drafted pick, she's my number one line on the hit
I only wanna see it (my starter) It's truly needed, When the ball drops...
Anything she say, you know I'm gonna do (my starter)
Watch out, watch out, when that ball drops...


You'se a starter, like Candace Parker
Take flight like Skywalker, might wolf it on ya father
Student Athlete, player of the week
G.P.A. 4.0 and her game's complete
Skintone buttercream, all defensive team
Dreamgirl like Jennifer Hudson, you're my Queen
To be, I'm ya King, keep ya under the wing
Together we can capture the ring
You the human highlight, body type, just right
Hairdo stay tight, go hard ball all night
All-star shine so bright
Hall of famer, about to take the game to new heights
You're my number one draft pick, McDonald classic
No look dunks to the basket
Yeah, yeah, that's mine, that's mine...




Blunt smoke, fifth hundred stroke
I'm going nuts, full clip, shoot up her fat lips
And round butt, catch Heat when I'm In Too Deep
The answer beeps, she take dives on the busiest streets
Whatever situation or the circumstances
Outdoor, indoor, she's taking the chances
Hotel, motel or Holiday Inn
Overlooking that bible, she continued to sin
Spread wide on the desk, paperwork all in a mess
While the ceiling fan blowing her dress
Ten minutes of jerking along with the slurping
Her skirt hid her talent until I raised the curtains
Showtime at the Apollo, she'll follow my lead
Then get on her knees, then swallow her pride
Strapped and ready to ride




Yeah, that's my down bitch
That's my down bitch, anything she do for her man
If it's lying on the stand, fish frying in the pan
She a Queen like Liz the third, wicked curves
On her word, stay still, rocking linens and furs
While she do it in the sack, jazz music in the back
Flat blew a nigga back, act two, I'm into that
Damn right, she the star of my team
When we stepped on the strip, baby girl, we the heart of the scene
Whether Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan or Queens
Staten Island, she styling, if not, she's not seen
Playboy status, every man's lust
She acting all shy, but she likes handcuffs


I'm the first on the court, first to hit the dance floor
The floss in this rap sport, what more can ya ask for?
Let ya glass pour, Wu-Tang is here now
All my Independent Women, time to let ya hair down
Bottles popping, everything is fair ground
Fresh legs, window shopping, can't help to stare it down
You'se a starter cuz I chose ya first
Baby, you'se a starter, where you throw that skirt
Lady, you'se a starter, where ya hold it down
Yeah, I'm Cold Blooded, then ya love my style
This is rush hour traffic, first one to merk off
It's like clockwork, first to get ya work off
I'm the workhorse, Killa Bee performer
Pro darter, starter, not a bench warmer, what?




You've learned how to kill
Every moved you've learned is trained to that end
Yet, we wish to preserve life
The first thing to learn, is that difference
Then you can start training with us, from the beginning




For money, I assassinate
Today, I have an opponent that's worthy
Now, killing me, you won't find that so easy


Clap your hands
Let's start the show, c'mon
1, 2, 3, 4, oh


Revolutionary gangster, the will to kill
Everything up, my roots is steel
Do it big time, march through the desert and shine
Let the C's live free while we open the minds
Of every black man, white man, no color, my writing hand
Is like dynamite, I fight for land
Blood stains yo, gettin money affect the plan
You travel to Beijing and end up in Japan
Hoods everywhere, bring the goods and gear
And teach them how to hold mics and grow them beards
Then stop, check my brothers and my sisters in Africa
We know that's theirs, yes, we been actin up
Bush fucked the world up, and left our soldiers
Out in Iraq, bless them with roses
Foes try to approach, we roast them goats
We terrorize the city while forgettin the quotes




They trying to take us down through (Reaganomics) and atomic bombs
On Islamic countries to stop them from being Islamic
But Islam is a way of life, Islam is the way of Christ
Islam means peace, the beast must pay a price
For his wickedness, politics is the trickiest
Business on this planet, the bandits are the slipperiest
Snakes who ever slithered, you ever stop to consider
Who's pulling these strings, from Napoleon to Hitler?
Is there an unseen hand with the unseen plan?
The unclean man from the unclean land
Desire to kill the righteous dumbs down the brightest
Give his life in this world that seem so lifeless
Put a price on things, that are priceless
Convince us that meanness is stronger than the niceness
Who really has the power - is is theirs, is it ours?
Is it a democracy, or the morning prowlers?
Do we have a press or President?
Is it a test or a testament? Pest or pestilence?
Who got the evidence?
Who got the common sense? Stop all the negligence




I oversee the world
You taught me that, basically
I'm moldin rap to be more than I can see
Chef, Senator of Thoughts
Democratic cats
Saved by the judge
The flavor, that was brought about that day
Steaks come out, raw




"WU, TANG!" 




Ooh-wee... mmmmmmmm, yeah...


See I was raised out on these mean streets
I'm from the projects, right, where poverty and hell meet
I'm searching everyday to find a better way, I've got a
Hustle still to get my pay before I hit bottom
Now some might say that I'm already there
But who are they to judge or question what I do, son
So I don't care
Tired of eating cheese sandwiches with no meat
Tired of watching all the players from the same seat
So it's a life of crime, some might sing or rhyme
To escape the ghetto before the flatline
Choices to make, what am I gonna do?
Got to use my talents, they gonna pull me through


Now with success, I become a target
They wanna set me up
I guess more money equals more problems
They wanna get me, wanna hit me, strip me of my riches
They wanna cut me up in pieces, leave me deep in ditches


And I can't take it.... but I'm gonna make it...
Yeah... oh... I'm gonna make it... yeah... ohhhhhh
Fight to stay alive


I was raised out on these mean streets
You know where poverty and hell meet
Brothers get jail and life's for sale, cheap
Since momma held me, in her arms, to tell me
That it's a cold world, I done held heat
And held myself down, lot of bodies and shells found
And niggas into taking everything, that ain't nailed down
We fell down, ain't hard to tell now
I ain't trying to see the cell now
Or see momma put her house up for bail now
So I'mma give all I got, to try and get that gwop
Nigga I'm hot with this hustle, go 'head and get the cops
I use my talent to get more figures
Unlike these little corner store niggas
Go change your drawers, niggas


Now with success and I've become a target
They wanna set me up, take me hostage
Or take me down some notches
They wanna hit me, wanna stick me, get me for my riches
They wanna diss me, want a clip me, leave me stiff in ditches

[Hook: Gerald Alston (Method Man)
And I can't take it, no, no, but I'm gonna make it...
(This ain't no game, my life ain't nothing to play with)
Yeah... I'm gonna make it... oooh...
(Face it, money is power and I'mma make it)
I'm gonna make it... oooh...


Yeah, I'm gon' survive, yo, yo, a-yo
N.Y. City, gritty blocks, little love, plenty cops
Few rise, many drop, True Lies, semis cocked
Fishscale, already rocked, heavy shots, that we drop
New guys on every block, blue eyes and red dots
Pregnant mothers, broke fathers, more money, more problems
So hungry, won't starve 'em, work hard and so pardon
I got mouths to feed, I got pounds of weed
I need some more, another store, another house, indeed
An X amount of G, the reason pounds'll squeeze
And strip you naked, basic, trying to make it out the P's
Don't ever doubt a G, and have me spazz like
'Face with the K, and my nose all powdery
It ain't about the streets, it's 'bout the beast within
That won't give in to 'lice, down to bleed, G


Now with success and I've become a target
They wanna set me up, take me hostage
Or take me down some notches
They wanna hit me, wanna stick me, get me for my riches
They wanna diss me, wanna clip me leave me stiff in ditches

[Hook: Gerald Alston (RZA)
And I can't take it (yeah), no, no, but I'm gonna make it...
(Yeah, yea, turn the beat up a little right here)
Yeah... I'm gonna make it... oooh...
(Yo, yo, yo, yeah, yo, just, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)


A-yo, RZA, Meth, GZA, Deck
Ghost and Chef be cashing checks
Killa, Cap be snapping necks
Street and 'Zilla flash the tech
Sacrifice a savage life
If he trying to bag my ice
Tag a price on merchandise
Tell me, is it worth ya life?


No... it's a cold, cold, cold world
You can't be playing games with my life
I've gotta fight to survive, fight to stay alive


A-yo, metal pipes ignite, sparking fire, light the darkness night
Trying to stick me for my riches, now y'all bitches taking flight
Major business, raise the digits, tried to strike me for my life
Slice and dice, men or mice, GZA tell 'em what it's like


A-yo, money making, people flaking, Cash Rules, fuck the bacon
Earth's quaking, head is aching, bank stop, dice shaking
Times are hard, so are jobs, scheming niggas wanna rob
Use a hoe to slob ya knob, hit you with unruly mobs
Stab you in the back and smile, watch you bleed for a while
Hating on the agile, steal ya name and bite ya style
Hold you for a ransom note, Goliath cutting David's throat
Grab ya vest, abandon boat and leave you out at sea to float


Now with success and I've become a target
They wanna set me up, I guess more money equals more problems
They wanna hit me, wanna stick me, get me for my riches
They wanna diss me, want clip me, leave me stiff in ditches


And I can't take it.... no, no... but I'm gonna make it...
Yeah... oh... I'm gonna make it... ooh... yeah...
It's a cold, cold, cold world
I got my hand on my gun, they got a brother on the run
Yeah... it's a cold, cold, cold world
You can't be playing games with my life
I've gotta fight to survive, fight to stay alive
This ain't a game, this is my life
Keep pushing me to the edge, I'm gonna push back
And you won't like that, it's guaranteed you won't like that
When ya laid down, laid flat...




Oh yeah, coming through with my Shaolin crew
Two cent for a case, gimme St. Ide's brew
In the midst of broken bottles and crushed up cans
Methtical's in a jam, oh how dry I am


With St. Ides in my system
Crack another I'm blessed, let's go get the next one
And get over, the object is to stay sober
Lay on the sofa, better yet, dial my chauffeur


Call me the Wallabee Champ, sretched out, could never be son
Ricochet daily hit the deli for a cold one
Naturally blessed, yes, my rap is like a laser beam
That blows in the bushes, St. Ide's fill the canteen


Crack the bottle of the St. Ide's, sipping to those
Who don't realize that drinking ain't only to be drunk
You can't drive, keep my peoples alive
And if the Saint don't know you from a can of paint


It was hot on the spot so I jetted up the block
I saw Ak with an Ide's, I could tell by the dot
On the back he be building, not that charcoal filtered
Ice cold bottle tilted, to my cup he spilt it
Ahh St. Ides




Daddy's home, your daddy's home to stay


Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo same time same channel
Nasty vandals too hot to fucking handle
Bring the ruckus to all you knotty head fuckas
Shit's like Hammer Time, niggas can't touch us


Straight up and down Wu-Tang forever
Come tougher than DJ Run's leather
Make a better tomorrow
Condition your atmosphere, air like feathers
The fire come, transmit vire come
The higher sire come, we burn your wire
Wu-Tang be number one...


Four years ago a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was Meth and it went this way

Yo, we took a test to become an MC
All the withers in the crowd got amazed at me
God threw me inside his Cadillac
The chaffuer drove off and we never came back

Meth cut the record down to the bone
And now I rock solid chrome microphones
Now we signing autographs, with cheers and laughs
Champagne, caviar, and bubblebaths, but see...

That's the life that I lead, you sucka MC, we G-O-D
Take that and move back, or catch a heartattack
Because there's nothing in the world the gods could ever lack

I chill at the party in my b-boy stance
Walk, cap low, 45 in my pants
Fly like a dove, that come from up above
My nigga's Iron Lung but you can stay one love

It's just a one two three a three a two one
Throw your blunts in the air for the god Iron Lung
Blow them right in your face with the bass
You messed up, come in first place, the real rap taste

First come, first serve basis
Coolin out boo, take you to the def places
One of a kind for you people's delight
And to you sucker MC, you know it ain't right
Bet you bite all your life, cheat on your wife
Run in a gun fight with nuthin but a knife
Bangin with your boy, slingin with the crew
And everybody know what you've been through
It's the one two three three two one
Throw your blunts in the air for your dunn Iron Lung
Smoke in your place with the highs and the bass
Come in first place in the real rap race
Go uptown, buy a bag of brown
You sucker MC, a sad face clown
Gettin OD ready to rock crowds steady
You drive a big car get your gas from Getti


I'm ODB in the place to be
Didn't go to St. John's University
In the streets of Brooklyn I aquired the knowledge
Allah Mathematics that's higher than college
I'm fly on skins that I gets in Queens
She love filthy swine and my collard greens
I'm dressed to kill, you know our style
Cause niggas don't know that Dirty Dogg fly

If you wanna see me baby come, you know Dirty Dog is number one
X2

I wrote this song about the (?)
You gotta know where to start when the beats play
X2




The heart is the general, the eyes are the scouts
The fists are the arrows, the body is the bow
All movements have to be....


It's phat, man, it's phat, man


I'm the 7 in the center of the sun, I keep shining
My inner light would turn my baby's tear drop to small diamonds
That be twinkling, while my love be sprinkling
We stay young while your old wicked faces be wrinkling
Allah's the most gracious, he made the universe the most spacious
Seen and heard in all places, but still appear faceless
Embraces all races, all caste and all cases
In every spec of life he's the substance of all traces

The answer to all questions, the spark of all suggestions
Of righteousness, the pathway to the road of perfection
Who gives you all and never ask more of you
The faithful companion that fights every war with you
Before the mortal view of the prehistorical, historical
He's the all and all, you searching for the oracle
A mission impossible, purely philosophical
But you call him on your death bed when you laying in the hospital

And as you play all day like the grasshopper who work and toil
Like armies of ants carrying stones of soil
Building a home for themselves and storing food
At night we praise Allah and adore the moon
In sync like the flow of the Nile, the growth of a child
Only fearing God, we great a ghost with a smile
That which is spirit is spirit, which is flesh is flesh
Meaning life has no partnership with death

Yo, I've been highly misunderstood by those who met us
They had ears of corn and heads of lettuce
Mentally dead, essentially led
By the false teachings, and eventually pledge
Their allegiance, to that which was against them
And exempt them from the truth
Then juiced them and pimped them
To give it in tithes, so the church can rise
While their babies home hungry covered with flies
Bzzzz, trying to harness the wind
Allah's the father from without and within
On Christ return, who will announce him?
Every tree is numbered, but who can count them?
The name of all things on this world, who can pronounce them?
Allah's the father of all, why do you doubt him?


The heart is the general, the eyes are the scouts
The fists are the arrow, the body is the bow
All movements have to be natural
The wrist must be strong and the fingers powerful
Fast, high kicks, a good firm stance
Avoid the enemy's strong points...
Eagle's Claw!



* appears on the international version of the album


Yo... this song is...
Aiyyo Dunn this song is called Sunshower
Cause we approachin the final hour
You know I ahh all I can say to my brothers and sisters right now
Is stay close to your families, and all your loved ones
Cause this globe is about to explode with hatred
They killin for pennies, knahmsayin?
Peace to the Gods, we got a heavy job... yo, yo

Trouble follows behind a wicked mind, 20/20 vision
Of the prism of light but still blind
Because you lack the inner, every sinner
Will end up in the everlastin winter of hellfire
Throw on this mix just picks your third eye out
You cry out your words fly out, and sounds die out
You remain unheard, sufferin eternally, internal external
Along with your wicked fraternal from generals to colonels
Releasin thermonuclear heat that burns you firmly
And permanently upon this journey
Through the journal of the book of life
Those who took a life without justice
Will become just ice ice ice
It's been taught that your worst enemy couldn't harm you
As much as your own wicked thoughts
What devils fought we wrought, and let's annoint
Now you're bein persecuted by that universal court court court
Iron hell with the strong blend of rape and blend of sandal
With rose petals and jasmine, as men use talismans
Burn some incense, chantin witchcraft to reach high dimensions
I'm convinced, Allah is God always has been always will be
You could travel every square inch of the planet Earth and still be
Ninety-three million miles away from the sun
Til you realize you and the sun is one, like the knowledge
Know the ledge to where your heart is
Or fall off into the internal hell that's uncharted
Light travels at the rate of 186,000 miles per second
Through time and space, until it reach a target
And once we're freed of darkness, and show em where the path
From which the Red Sea was parted, into these straight
At the narrow gate, but wide is the road to destruction and hate
What you thought life was a sport? A game?
One hundred years short, know the soul is immortal
Walk through many portals, and those who go astray
Will pay a judgment day, and these few years of wicked bullshit
Ain't worth the eternity inside a sulfur lake
With dragons and snakes, and any pain you can imaginate
Instead, I chose to become a newlywed to the true bread
Of life and fed God Degree of light to my head
It's been said, the fool who sleep is already dead, so I stay awake
And take care of my brother, and uncover reveal the skin
So we can see each other, cause every color
That makes the light appear duller, who's the colored man?
Who's the original, who's the biochemical
Who's the grafted digital, digital, digital, digital
Digital.. yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

Two hundred thousand million atmosphere cubic feet of air we breath
While niggas minds are trapped twenty thousand fathoms beneath
The sea of reality, they can't inhale deep, devils have em
Stagnant, a trapping, the .45 magnum
And shatter bone fragments
Cops love the block you gettin backed up by Dragnet
Thrown into a six by eight steel cabinet
Liftin weights readin ancient tablets, back on the block nobody's havin it
Those who haven't learnt get returned
You freaky ass niggas get burned
Some walk around like they ain't concerned
With the hell goin on inside the world
Why do grown men molest little girls?
Is it because the girl's breast has swelled
To the size of a woman, although she's twelve
The whole world is sick, sick, sick
Trapped up in six, six, six
I started off as a pawn in this marathon of life
Tryin to carry on, wishin I had a bomb to blow up Babylon
A vagabond, tryin to steal his corpse we're from paragon
Goin in circles, like a ferris wheel
Undernourished meals I cherish hope, drown inside the sea of life
Use my third eye for a periscope, and take flight to the edge of night
To far heights so dark that even wit a bright light
You couldn't see a spark of light
While others play ball, I recall, me and GZA, Dirty
Hangin in halls, bangin on walls
Kickin rhymes three hours straight with no pause
Boostin from Freeport sunrise to Amityville morgue
Kept razorblade between the jaws, breakin all laws
Started out writin fables to makin beats on lunchroom tables
To wearin long cables that hung down to the navel
So pack some crack and fat sacks of skunk
To funnel the P-Funk, smokin woolie blunts
Dust cocktails and primos, shot more dice than casinos
Back when Wu-Gambinos were called F.O.I. MC's
All and Together Now Crew B.C.C
REC Posse, G.P., D.M.D
Ol' Dirty stalked East New York, GZA maintained Franklin Lane
I was going to Thomas the Jeff, where students got slain
Old Earth got nervous walked me to Shaolin sent me to Curtis
Took share time in Marquis, U-God general contractin service
While Meth Chef and Deck was off the New Dorp
For white boys who took steroids
Buildin up bicep tricep pectoids and deltoids
Back when our girlfriends was virgins
Cuttin class with Ghost tryin to bag hoes in Murry Bergtraum
A Maybeldine beacon night school Washington Irving
These young Gods was seekin
Hoes in Westinghouse and Clara Parton and Medina
Girls who sung like Sarafina
On the corner of Belmont and Picket Avenue I seen her
As if I dreamed her
I was dead broke, now I will use key notes to make G-notes
So it's always hope
See subway train run through the city like blood through the veins
To the heart of Medina, but Shaolin is the brain
So take heed to these words
And feel the power of the Sunshower

Approachin the final hour
Power equality, Allah Cees everything
Let's come together under the wings
And take flight, Wu-Tang, the saga, Rzarecta
In your sector





For the supreme architecture
That's the one who come with the most illest ideas
The one who come with the illest creation
A supreme architecture is actually someone who build the universe
If I personally say I'm the supreme architecture
I'm I'm lettin Allah speak right, right there knahmsayin?
I'm speakin right through that, I'm I'm becomin a vehicle


Word it's like the truth
They say the truth shall set you free
You hear the truth, it sets you free
So, mathematics is truth
When it adds up, there's no error
The only time there's an error
When man miscalculate his own... problem
Knahmean his own equations

On the firing line... lock, one round load
Ready on the right? Ready on the left?
Ready on the firing line? Watch for ya targets
(Yeah, yeah, yeah...) pay attention


Welcome to the fish fry where niggas get burnt to a crisp
Jump out the pot, "Yeah yo I got this"
Long armor, construction's on, I'm pro-drama
Catch me in the wildest beefs, I bring bombers
Bearded like Talibans, booted, my black ninjas
'll come through, tuxedos on with the gold llamas
Priceless like emeralds, check out the ski mask
King Tut's nephew gave it to me for three bags
Of heron, Don Baron, sniff a bag of blow
Fifth out, runnin' up in Saks with the ill army
Shake feds, play dead, yo check out what Rae said
Lay on ya hands, let the Branson break bread
High energy, all my niggas a kin to me
Regardless how it go down I still get ten a ki
Beware of my enemies, y'all remember me
Nikes with the low goose on and I've been a beast
Wilding in my headphones, red in my stones
Good ganja out, if I die fill up my headstones
With water, dough, acid and gold classics
All my niggas who pump, the spirit'll jump out and grab shit
Max with the laser on 'em, staircase caskets (caskets)
Broke bugged thugs in the hallway maxing (maxing)

 + (movie sample)
Still them 1-6-Ooh niggas, straight up (whoa, hold up, hold up)


The nozzle aim rip through ya frame for pocket change
Fiend for the Rush Hour 4 then pop a vein
Thousand dollar corks pop, pause or get off top
Used to be a general, just lost your spot
Animal House, two grand'll handle ya mouth
Beast mode with the G-Code cancel 'em out
Son, I've seen Hell, fell into the palms of Satan arms
Don that I am made 'em bow in the face of God
Graveyard Shifting, different day, the same thing
The name ring then the chain swing and dames cling
Money green, Maury kicks, whips and new fitteds
(It was all a dream) Advocated by the few who do live it
Bloomberg make a nigga cop the Mausberg
Shorty ain't a shorty, he a shooter like Wahlberg
Old man told me, "Don't be blind to deception
Only strive for perfection homey, ya mind is a weapon"


Relax, you got ya muscles tight, relax
Word... Word...

 + (U-God)
First we told y'all niggas, then we showed y'all niggas, huh?
(We gon' take it back with this)
By the time you get a show, we've been all around the globe, huh?
(We gon' take it back with this)
Before you even had a name, you was screaming "Wu-Tang"
(We gon' take it back with this)
When we was running on the block, you was under ya pops, remember
(We gon' take it back with this... let's go)


Armor truck money, Shazam bangles, play the throne like
Julius Caesar, gorilla mob, slash, Killah's gaurd
Fake passports and visas, all of my goons
They be carrying spoons because boom he had a massive seizure
Hot chocolate lovers, guns is published
Detroit bitches out of town be dying to fuck us
This is real talk, shank lullabyes
Ben Franks, we like Jet Blue we stay hella high
Curl on the dumbell L, we can't even S-P-E-L-L
MTV or TRL's
Supreme novelists, we rank superior, guarding the post
Down low in the 'jects, got it locked in ya area
Ain't tryna hurry up
We like rebel niggas powdered up wilding in the streets of Liberia
No matter the crime, I'm beating the case
If I'm a wrong, a chair hit a judge right in his face
Shitting shanks out, come to court dates
Mittens on shines with blood Wally's that's the color of wine


Talk to me, my criminal mystique
Kick back the boards, six thousand a week
Pay homage, what the don beat, you're a minor threat
I see ya sweat roll down ya cheek
And ya soft and sweet, ya talk is pork
Get murdered in New York when I enforce the heat
And the cost ain't cheap, my advice is priceless
Bring back the life that ya thought was lifeless
The way of the gun, son, who the nicest?
S.K., no stun gun, smooth devices
Time crisis, I played the game, low lifers
In a brawl, ripped the phones out the walls in Rikers
Vipers in the infirmary rooms with slicers
Shiesters with hate in their blood might bite ya
Fuck that bitch if yo wife don't write ya
Cancel her, buy another one just like her
Pipers in the bucket of ice taste righteous
Today's mathematics when we build in cyphers
The baby automatic kill like Air Force strikers
I'm still Asiatic when I spill the hypeness


The dark, and this place will come here
That's right!

Blood money mercenaries, think you can muscle Wu?
It's a foot race, who can out-hustle who?
Hip hop junkie flunky, monkey see, monkey do
Great minds connect like mobster rings
Sit back, let me do my, Sinatra thing
I'm in the Hip Hop Hall of Fame, on the wall is the plaques
Old ball and chain, I named her Madam X
She love big cannons, sex unprotected
You better respect it, kid, we 'bout to set trip
You get ya neck ripped, eyeballs are scoping
I don't sell crack, I sell dopium
Catch him at the podium, nah, he moving too fast
Professor X, behind the bulletproof glass
You need a Wu pass, a bag of that high
Easy with the flicks, baby, I'm camera shy

We might have to 8 Diagram one of y'all MC's
We grind everyday and we hustle for cheese
Got our face on the front of CD's, we off the hook
W.T.C. y'all soft and shook
Y'all not built like the Cuban Linx Clan that get CREAM
And back heads down every time we sing
Give us a hundred grand for a show, let us rock
For more money, more chicks, more private stock


They call me Streetlife, slap the taste
Out ya mug, know ya place, you ain't thug, fix ya face
Throw a slug, catch a case
Meanwhile, beat trial, back on that cash cow
Getting CREAM, however, a street brother know how
Point blank, I'm pulling rank, calling shot, I got bank
Pass the rock, my hand's hot, hit 'em with the showshotter
Peace to my ala mater, Wu-Tang block scholars
Never settle for less, promoters pay us top dollar

The Clan'll talk, Calabama niggas all'll quit
Talking that short dick shit, we was s'posed to be cool
Only the clue's on the other end of the stick
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Over-crowded police blood bamboo bimbo
Chickenhead skeezer crackrock hoodrat
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Barney here is down to a feeding dreadlock
Armpit like two Buckwheat's in a headlock
Macy Gray's hair between your leg lock
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Ya mother's so cross-eyed, when she cry tears roll down her back
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
{*coughs*} This shit is strong, god damn, what you got in there?
Over-crowded police blood bamboo bimbo
Chickenhead skeezer crackhead hoodrat
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Ya mother's so cross-eyed, when she cry tears roll down her back
Calabama niggas all'll quit
Talking that short dick shit
Speak up, no loud speaker but I'm speaking loud
Venacular ass kicking, truth got there in crowd
Shit, they call me the lethal lip
The linguistic, full metal jacket of venacular ballistic
Shooting out at the mouth without Chap or Blistec
Here's a mothafucka, I didn't flunk diaper rash
I'm verbally toxic, metal-piercing, forked, hollow point tongue
Dum dum, pow, shot from gattling gums
Hooked on phonics, packing a vicious vocabulary
Malicious, with malice and mayhem
Fuck a dictionary, give me the mic and I'll slay
Them and literally poetic symptoms
Pissing me the fuck off, missing me with that shit
I stick a venacular foot so far up in ya ass
You won't be able to pass verbal gas
So far in ya ass that one of my knees will rise so far above ya head
And you drown of a poetic ass kicking
Leaving lyrical lacerations on your lungs, from a verbal hangnail
That hung on my big toe, as I flow upward
Kicking yo on ya eardrum, you wanna hear some?
Tap dance on ya tonsils, leaving kiwi shoe polish on ya breath
Cavity in ya best rhyme, and I'm the access on the rest
Call me the proverbial verbal menacing dentist
With the drill, I got lyrical skills
I could perform oral root canals
It's unwise to fuck with me
Kick ya wisdom teeth down ya throat
Leaving you to choke
On where it hurts, unspoken vocals
Tying down ya vocal cord and windpipe tight
With toe jamming and ya mothafucking hemmoroids
Fuck the dumb shit...




After laughter comes tears


Check the script, me and the gods gettin' ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
Had a box, 'boom boom' the bass would blast
We was laughin' at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had began to discuss
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid you bust?)
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
'Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha
Not knowin' exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect to come across a crazy gunner
"Hey, Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough!"
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said "No!"
Money splattered him, BOW! Then he snatched the bag
Hit his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood all over the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones that have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, I was laughin' all the time
I taught him all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words


After laughter comes tears


Me and my man, my ace Big Moe from the shelter
'Bout to hit the skins from this girl named Thelma
Now, Thelma had a rep that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the mornin', somethin' got to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat and practice safe sex!
He seemed to ignore, I said, "Be for real!
She's not even worth it to go raw deal."
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power U
Twenty minutes went by, Moe, I'm out without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am airin' out
Hey yo, he came out laughin' with glory
I'm surprised he's still livin' to tell his story
But he carried on with the same old stuff
With Stephanie, like a Whammy, he pressed his luck
Moe tried to be down with O.P.P.
Ain't nothin' wrong, but he got caught with the H.I.V.
Now no life to live, doc says two more years
So after the laughter I guess comes the tears


After laughter comes tears



* this is actually a remix of "HandClap" which is a bonus track on "The W"


We gon' what? *beat kicks in*

No yin to my yang, it's a black thing

The ol' abbot 'n shit, y'knahmean?
You gotta sit still, after a while, knahmsayin?
But as long as he keep the fire burnin
Any spark, he can he can touch another fire
He can spark another person, another person
That's why you see in the kung-fu flicks
You see the abbot, you know
That he don't come back to fight the villain
He get a student, he train a student for that job




Okay.. the GZA
Tony Touch classic, knowhatI'msayin?
We gonna bang y'all, in the head one time
Blaze up on y'all one time real fast (Do the mix and all that shit)
Knamsayin, word up (Make it make it a record real quick, do yo' thang)
Throw ya seatbelts on, ahhight?
(Yeah, hook it up, make it a record, get down yo)

I take y'all niggas straight, +Beneath the Surface+
To the core, if it ain't raw its worthless
Pentab professional, hold the ink
Wild river rafters fall off the raft and sink
Tony let a brother Touch, twenty bar rush
The way we push through equivalent to rocket thrust
Allah just, I lay it for the mix tapes
Quick to quake a label-mate
The sound came outta rusted crate
Surrounded by cobwebs
Beat smooth enough to slide through like bobsleds
On a cold white snow, plus with the right flow
Wu-Tang niggas they shine and make the mic glow


We killin all gorillin with all that screwfacin
Pacin back and forth looking savage, stop it


Whether plugged in or plugged out
Iron grill mugged or thugged out
Blood in or blood out, son was bugged out
Might look at you and slice you
Buck fifty face stupid, the shape of one Nike swoop
Who the fuck you think let y'all wild niggas in
Allowed you to put down ya guns, and raise ya pen
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig, we don't fuck with no pig
We teach the kids, you rather have a bullet or a word to your wig
Murder rates increases, bullet holes the size of fifty cent pieces
Don't worry about the weed or pussy, I read books
I'm liable to mate'cha king with three rooks
You see the Wu W, raise the black fist
Maybe Tony Touch's concord needle will scratch this
The ice cube link you bought, from the Jew for 80 G's
Was only appraised at 42
Gazed upon by the eyes of multitude
Of people, who would trade gold for food
I heard boar's head killed more than nuclear warhead
Or street serfs who walk around dressed in all red
Bobby Digi said if you ever in Compton or Long Beach
Break my sons Doc Doom and Crisis wit a nice piece


Penetrate on mix tape, with the legislation
Illustrate constant elevation
Spark friction, Shawshank Golden Arm Redemption
Endorsed my the Masta inscription signature


Off top my unorthodox style of attack
Is like Hannibal rollin on elephant's backs
Pack a long barrel, bustin off strong ammo
My light so vast I cast twenty foot shadows
First family, fifth cappo, micro to macro
Load it in ya head play it back slow
Act like you know, this is no drill
Murderous rap revealed goin for kill
On these New York city sidewalks we walk
Camoflauge, dodgin the eyes of the hawk
Kani Sport, totin the fifth, slidin off
My live source movin across with brute force
Bloodsport, anymore heads face the blade
Fakers must fade, the stakes are now raised
Words of murder, suspense, and intrigue
Make major league niggas show signs of fatigue
My Killer Bees span wider than seven seas
Squeeze on MC's, with bullet train speed
Tony's touch create more gold than Midas
Ya highness, all in ya head, like ya hair stylist


Frosty mug, big ring leaders top secret thug
Lampin in cheaters Orenthal with the murder glove
Boat of the town, devilish grin look peculiar
Swung on this faggot, knocked the windows outta Silvia's
Timb's got scuffed up, my ankles got sprained, that's my word
To every single seed, I smack flames
Staten Island's bayside of teachers of Elijah
Thrown out the temple, now collided wit the father
Nickname's Pudding, Clarence 13X before the Will Smith's
And the limelights of Cuba Gooding
Lost in the cosmos, explodin through a quasar
Be duckin pulsars, organic state still be the Gods
Tony Touch, Tony Touch
Word up
Big Face Ghost in effect



"5...4...3...2...1...0"
*explosion*


Yea, this is the poisonous, venomous
Killa bee, queen bee connection
Live and direct
Shaolin, BK, QB, Boogie Down, wherever you found

Yo, yo, Deadly Venom is how we end em
Mast avenge em, no friend of him
Bend em in half for enterin
My comrodery move like tight security
Known to tear the club up plus the after party
On the battle field catch a body
With no fair warnin, my queen bee connect swarm on em
Primate, hold your mic straight before you challenge me
Your light weight and only force me to cause casualty
Battery packs catch match mines with the solar powered
They get over powered
Shower with rhymes just like white lines of powder
Feel the realness from bein solo with this crowd here


Yo, yo, yo, we takin no shorts for sure
Comin through, smash you mother fuckers to floor
Whoever wanted war, yo, bring it
If you got the sword, I'ma swing it
Slither back to the pit when my phone started ringin
Yo, Come here, what's up, niggas rock to get stuck
Niggas runnin through the chamber we ain't givin a fuck
Cuz I'm deadly, I'ma set the pace like a medly
Relay, who could match the venom on the replay


Aiyyo, the bitch nice and catch crack like dice
Give em a double order of man slaughter on the tape recorder
Fuck the law and order, tape muffled and distorted
All you heard was murderous shots, the rest was pre-recorded
The jury voted, I'm a free venom, hittin niggas with the momentum
Even villains wanna get up in em
The feelin's devious from the breathious
The way we leavin this is sure to make snakes hiss


It be I, the most high, fly robin fly
Keep a close eye on Johnny 5, I'll be comin live
]From New York, it's saturday night
So it's only right, I step to the phony types
See em at the party actin hard, but the hardly a threat to the vet
Once you start me, no stoppin, no pardon me
No coppin a plea, I beat you in the head, third degree
What's the science, the 411, can't do me none
Still ghetto, I rhyme ghetto, my brother's ghetto
Never say die and never settle
For anythin less than what the devil posess
I'm like MOP to the death
Now who is Johnny Blaze, Mr. Meth
Mother fuckers


Hittin fever, come with the raw
Deadly Venom meet the Wu, no more to come, now what is left to do
(Ghetto collaborations, such a deadly combination
Face to face, Shakin your earth, rockin your nation)


Yo, yo, yo, Sons of fishes rollin with a devious Clan
I got a master plan here to blast your man
Gettin lyrical, fightin your feelin deep in your mental
Like a pencil all in your brain, killin your spiritual
The original, fishin yall, rollin with a bunch of criminals
Street gunner, Venom strike like thunder
This some shit that'll stop your hunger
Ready for war, like me let you get a taste of the raw
Comin through with the Clan so you won't get far
Batters and scars, all respect due to the gods
And my queen killa bees just collectin that cheese
Overseas, gettin ready for the year 2G, DVs

(Poison Clan rocks the world)


(The Pillage!!)
Yo, I'm a great comodity, for see me
The great unchained magnetic
Release mine, fuck yall, piece mine together
To the third power, hit yall like may flowers
Scandal, slash three felonies to be the one six vandal
]From Park Hill, Shaolin put the work in
Dusk do us dawn, Lebanon Don
Don't sleep on the adversary
Mental niggas stalk yall out on the ferry
You got trapped in between pillars
And the venoms, cherry heads are minimum


Yo, yo, yo, projects of elimination
We jack some like Rhythm Nations
Got your hard speed like we drag racin
We lab replacin, but tried to avoid a confrontation
You kind of mixed up like Tiger Woods with that combination
I ain't called no names, here's a hint
Niggas with no names, antique things, gold chains
Do admire the visual, 'bout the coolest Carolina
Individual, Everything digital, like Bobby
I'm lovin all them kung-fu flicks, poison em lively
My crew be known to run through cliques, but fast in a hurry
We I smash, leave your vision blurry
Tryin to make the bill like Murray




Yo, on the french kiss, sour than blood, hotter than piss
You ventriliquist talkin out your ass like this
Cuz I insist that you don't wanna show the tape of the hits
I told yall, I crush yall on the tape like Quake
You tweaky trick, wanna violate, great, Wu and Venom annihilate
Don't hesitate to push the rhymes like weight
You Shake, Jake thing


Yo, PLO, when the guns blow, you'se a no show, homo
Holdin like a scarecrow with no dough
Street pro's move through the metro
Rapidly my faculty quick to blow the boost out your battery
My african queen bees is backin me, shuttin down your salary
J-Boo twist another Daquiri, fifty steamboat float
Flow on this scenario, hydro thoughts lick off like a callico


Let's get it on, mic's get blown when you step into my zone
Heads get flown for tryin to clone
I take that, lie you on your back like you wanna go on
For one, there's no part, hold on, like float on
I keep it tight, rip all sides to a square
You ain't seen no thugs like these no where
I swear, you wanna test me, who can it be
Rollin with the Fam, Wu-Tang, DVs


Yo, I dead MC's with this poisonous venom
Return and send em, wack niggas is in em
The secretly analyzed, this shit is live
I see the allies tryin to stalk the bee hive
Forgot the deadly stingin was major bell ringin
Too strong for niggas with eyes closed and slingin
Make your point, spot your target and zoom in
Before its too late, saw the snake through his hand shake
Aimin your darts at a click you can't handle
Attack with the paint stones and travel on camel
A warm sigh as you cross the barrier
But my storm side, will destroy ya area



(Poison Clan rocks the world
Poison Clan rocks the world)




Freedom of speech
Watch how I reach my potential
I still know hustlin, dope tracks
And instrumentals
Travel the world
Found black diamonds in the Everglades
Fought Temptations
Slap-boxed in The Devil's cage, Globe Trotter, spot-rusher
I bust in your mouth like a Gusher
It's Wu Tang motherfucker!
I ain't mad , I cock My music in the chamber
I'm God's gift; heard I was born in a manger
Danger! Cosmetic face rearrange you
Leave you slumped on the chestboard found by a park ranger
Burst of adrenaline, bungee jump off of the ?
I skydive in some sky-blue Ferragamo's
In the streets heavy, my charms chunky
You damn right I fuck fans
And I keep the munchies


Loose canon, forty deuce flicks
To Paris, way back at the Palace
Like Mike Harris, callous
Fly nicest, metallic, bang mallets
Fly your whole carriage to Paris
The black Pat Garrett, carats on
Donna Karens, guys die trying to
Drive the McLaren
Islamic, got chronic out on the terrace
Angelic body lie cold without spirit
My finest hour, you sacrifice to a higher
Power. Fly from the tower, I fly sour
And raw powder, .40 cal give your pal a shower
Oh shit! My new Calvin Klein trousers
Night prowler, your life is ours
Knife your Eddie Bauer, leave you
Push up flowers. You ain't counting
Chip-counters, niggas is pimps, your bitch
Shouted. The 650 get cloudy..


Could it be? Don't discriminate
We dudes black and blue, smack on crews
Like they're food, taking space up
On my dinner plate. Depending on
My mental state, the mood that I'm in'll
Make me charge like a bull, pull the tool out
And ventilate you, sinner taste you down
Make your crown face your frown, full of
Rounds from the pound that detonate when
They penetrate. Tell you always been a snake
You don't move like I do, imitators hate the fact
That they can't do what I do
I'm mindful of my rivals, I can
Smell em when they slide through
? my arrival, they won't even get a side-view
Won't know that life is over
Til I'm standing right beside you
It's not that I don't like you, motherfuckers
I despise you. The other different pedigree
Not cut from the same cloth, stay G'd up
From the feet up, while your heart pump duck sauce
I love it when they tough talk
My guns love to bust off, but every time
I squeeze they call police, they bus me up north
Sinister the finisher, they label me a menace
And got mad when I laughed at the judge
During sentencing, not glorifying prison but
I'm built tough for bidding
It's survival of the fittest shit
I living in ? every hour to the second
I'm gaining my respect
Never catch the guard in the yard
Sharpening the weapons, got shooters
On demand, new crews for the Clan
Sticking everything moving, more loot for the fam
Ain't a damn thing changed, just say the name, bitch:
Wu Tang





Man we always been loose
Dealin off the turf like it was never gonna run dry
That ain't no business
No other game is run so disorganized
Look around
Everything that is taken care of business
Is together, dig it? TIGHT~!
(Together, except us)
 Right!




That's black? Whattup God?
Aiyyo Shorty got beef with that nigga? Word?
{*blam, blam blam*} Oh shit!!! Yo!
Hold the fuck up


Aiyyo yo, eight niggas down (just enough)
Fuckin around with my sound (ci-ty)
Yo, bring backup (ci-ty)
Fuckin with me, and mine
Murderous, check it, yo


The world is shifty, we living just enough for the city
The rough witty Killa Bee sting just like the jiggy
My Family Stone, foes attempt to gradually clone
Labelled MIA and I send the casualties home
In closed coffins, Wu storming like the light brigade
Ride the wave like Frankie Avalon inside the cyber age
Crime pays, the law's long arm be tryna strong arm
Walking time-bombs who thrive on firearms
The charm smoker, I hit the dread with a poster
We told 'em to show him love and exposed the black toaster
Composer was shook, I took your bad looks for joke
Get your back broke, deep throat this Murder, I Wrote
The antidote be seeking like a buried treasure
By every measure lethally inject your whole sector
Wanted Dead or Alive, Rebel I escapes
Across the desert sand, leaving no footprints to trace
Keep a war face, your place conceal the baby knives
On the North breaks, I still shine in shady times


We living just enough (living just enough)
Just enough for the city) (for the city)
Just enough for the city


Yo, In the jungle, I make moves like Iron Monkey
Plots to bump me off, D.O.C. be on the hunt for me
We stay hungry for money drugs and guns
Ones who fake get caught in the crossfire for crumbs
Know the science be my guidance
The facts tell, gats sell like sex and violence
And break the project silence, a vision
This is way beyond four corners, escape this mental prison
Before we're all goners, now embrace the world
For the world war is ocean bomber, visionary soldier karma
My code of honor, mind still scarred from the drama
Trauma sent to victim, witness them run, scream in horror
Military chopper come gun down the slum
The outcome do or die son, it's bound to come
Mentally aware I see truth within the square
The future's here catch me on computer software
Warfare's inevitable, Rebel I hold several government official
Issue thirty-eight specials, that step through
Like Nat Turner create a spectacle
I may die in the scuffle but I'm taking forty devils


We livin just enough
Just enough
Just enough
For the ci-ty


Killa Beez, stinging MCs
Yeahhh, Wu




Yeah, yeah
I see everything
I see everything
YouknowhatI'msayin?
It's like when we come through
You better have your fuckin third eye open
You know, cause thats what time it is
YouknowhatI'msayin?
Cause it's like, when you walk
You striving for perfection
That's what we doing
Understand?
So all that little fake shit out there
We know the science on that
We done seen that shit from, from
From difference of angles
YouknowhatImean?
It's like, yo kid, for real
Wu-Tang, we set off a lot of shit in this shit kid
YouknowhatImean?
But you know, you know us
We play it calm, humble
YouknowhatImean?
But I just be checking out niggas darts and I be like
Damn, them niggas, them niggas is
Really, really, really, really, really
They gonna stay shit!
Uh ha, uh ha ha
YouknowhatImean?
But it's all good cause I'm the soul controller
YouknowhatImean?
Rather I say we the soul controllers
The bottom line, like I said
Deal with freedom, justice, equality
You know?
Keep shining, add on
Food, clothing, and shelter
All my niggas, go pick up uniforms
Go, when you buy this album
Go pick up uniforms, for real
YouknowhatImean?
Cause don't think we doing this just for anybody
We doing this shit for certain niggas kid
Certain people rather, certain
Certain fans, certain supporters
Certain delegators, word
What the fuck man, I'm tired of seeing these
Fake ass niggas fucking, running with the fucking globe
Ain't even, ain't even really seeing it the
Way it, it should really be seen
YouknowhatImean?
It's like, if you going to spread mathematics
Spread it right
YouknowhatImean?

* Dhani Harrison & John Frusciante play guitars


Shh, shh, shh, shh, Wu, Wu, Tang, Tang


The joy the flowers bring me
The pain still has me sinking
All while my heart gently weeps
Your smile has got me shrinking
The tears in your eyes are twinkling
Because the heart gently weeps


Snowy night, fiends basin', A Raisin in the Sun was amazing
The joint on the dresser, a gauge went off
Jumped up, fish tank, it fell, and they stuck
They shot her cousin LaVon, he owed a buck
Willie was awful, pulled out the ratchet, let off two
Grits fell on his leg, Kiana ripped the cold bowl
He violent, an Island nigga with the talent
Of six killas who just came home, from straight whylin
Robbin everything in Macy's, Lacy, short haircut
With long arms who fuck niggas, got four babies
Yvette jabbed her, slapped her wig off, ran in the crib
She did the dumb shit, my nigga then clapped her
Lester, smoked Chester sister Vest, I heard it was a mess
They ripped the apple out her throat, blessed her
Hungry hyenas from Medina, all "A-trainers"
Who got reluct', think fast and blast from Beamers


Yeah, yo
I brought my bitch out to Pathmark, she's pushin the cart
Headed to aisle four, damn I got milk on my Clark's
That's what I get, not focusin from hittin that bark
My mouth dried, need plenty water quick, I feel like a shark
In the aisle bustin them paper towels and wipin my Wally's down
I stood up to face a barrel, he's holdin a shiny pound
It's him, he want revenge, I murdered his Uncle Tim
I sold him a bag of dope, his wife came and copped again
{*singing*} That bitch is crazyyyyy
And uh, she brought her babyyyyy
She knew I had the murderous smack
It killed her man though
Now I got his fuckin' nephew grippin' his gat
You's a bitch - {*singing*} you better kill meeeee
You know you're bootyyyyyy
You pulled your toolie, out on meeeee... motherfucker
First thought was to snatch the ratchet
Said fuck it and fuckin grabbed it
I ducked, he bucked twice, this nigga was fuckin laughin
I wrestled him to the ground, tustle, scuffle, constantly kicked him
He wouldn't let go the joint, so I fuckin bit him
Shots was whizzin, hittin Clorox bottles
Customers screamin, then the faggot ran out of hollows
I had to show him what it's all about
Next thing you read in the paper, "A man who came to kill gets knocked out"


I don't know whyyy-hy-hyyyy, nobody told you
Man's not supposed to cry...
Though we're just babies, and it's so crazy
How tears of joy bring so much life


Yo, ayo, yo, yo
You on your way to the store nigga grab me a Dutch
I'm mad as fuck, my dude
My count was short when I was baggin it up
Now I need liquor, nigga pass me a cup
What's up with Officer Brown?
The other day he tried to shackle me up
He killed Kase and now he hasslin us
This motherfucker got balls
Even the gall to try and pattin me up
Time to re-up, let these niggas know we back on the block
With three hundred off a G-pack, crack in the spot


I don't know whyyy-hy-hyyyy, nobody told you
Man's not supposed to cry...
Though we're just babies, and it's so crazy
How tears of joy bring so much life


The joy the flowers bring me
The pain still has me sinking
All while my heart gently weeps
Your smile has got me shrinking
The tears in your eyes are twinkling
Because the heart gently weeps






{Yo, up in the M.G.M. coked up}, psych
Six niggas walked in flashing they gems peace (Aight
One dark skinned nigga fifty-six inch rope wrapped around twice
Smash the Gilligan boat with ice
(They threw sign language, ordered hot coffee
{wit a danish}
Relax, whispered they, "Rap entertainers"
(Had Lizzy on, two Japanese birds with furs look good kid)
Laid back handling hors d'ourves
(It's like round three) We too black for BET
You memorize the 1 to 40 (I'm at the 19th degree
If a civilized person doesn't perform his duty, what shall be done?
Pardon me God, that nigga got a gun
Bulging out his sweatpants, check out his stance
See the side of his grill? (Look like my cousin Lance
Left hand, rocky Guess watch) Yo I think I did his Clarks
He wanted crush bone leather with the strings dark
(Now I remember) He from Bear Mountain
He and Mitch Greene shot the fair one (Near the water fountain)
Seventh round, Chavez bleeding from his right ear
Yo keep your eye on that same nigga from right here
Popcorn spilling all on Liz Claiborne
(Ghost had the fly Gucci mocks wit no socks on
Seen Deion Sanders in the back with the phat fur on)
Working them hoes with the fly Wu shirts on
Mixed drink session Dun (Pour me some more)
Chef leathered down blinking at Chant Moore
Tenth round Chavez tearing 'em down) Sweet Pea get ya shit off
(It's like blacks against the Germans) Getting hit off
(Smooth and them walked in) Brownsville representing
(They sent a bottle over, autograph blessing)
Chef, pull out the doo-doo, twist the dank - pink noodles
(Yo I'm bout to roll one) Matter fact twist two of those
(Yo they wound up stopping the fight
Steels took a point away from Chavez) Rematch scheduled on October Ninth
Rematch scheduled on October Ninth




Yeah, yeah yeah now, what the fuck now?
Flipmode Wu-Tang shit, what the fuck now?
Yeah yeah yeah..
Historical and monumental shit
What the fuck now? Yeah, yeah, yeah


Straight smack a nigga right in the face like this was handball
Or make a mural out his face up on a damn wall
Niggas play hard and shit; if you know what's best for you
Y'all niggas better safeguard your shit
Even though we rep brass knuckle rap
Fuck with street geniuses and bowlegged chicks who walk with a gap
Street niggas now the corporate boss
Still go to y'all resteraunt for steamed fish and Irish moss
And y-yo, the way we do it and you see how my shit bomb
Your whole show wack and I'mma cancel your sitcom
Fuck a nigga broad 'til she tired and real calm
You ain't knowin my name tattoed on your bitch arm
The way we blow SHIT is a shame
Casually bust my gun and celebrate bustin a cork on the champagne
Wrote you with a whole new approach that lead a whole team of niggas
Y'all should know I only ball like a coach, NOW!


Check out the light fixture, freak lines like white bitches
Let the mic lines - hang that slang is ridiculous
Emperor of warlords, big gun only fuck with sawed-offs
That's my specialty, more to bust
Shot out my bed parrot keep it gangster Lord
I analyze your work those that got merked were not established
Texture look classy, arm baby 2000 raspberry
S-5, blowin through Asbury
Soon to own steakhouses, glowin like makeover thousand
Them them niggas, robbin from Pinkhouse's
Show and prove, knockin off cab drivers
God, sodomize money, ring two hundred thousand
See the color of the carved out Wu emblem
Baby, it's all designers, tailor-made Wu gooses
Limousine, automatic new uzi's in 'em yo
Relax, cousin just cruise through, jewels with him


Move up the block, giant box blast my song
Non-stop strictly hip-hop, march on
Doo-rag hang long, metal tape is high-bias
Graphics, captured with the colorful, iris
I zoom in, while the listeners tune in
Some assumin they paid dues and joined the union
Lost nigga couldn't rumble in this wild jungle
Quick to crumble, type to be on the stand and fumble
Divine Master, threw on the track that made 'em bleed
He produce at unattainable rains of top speed
This powerful magnet, that left 'em stagnant
Was unlikely in cameras in larger fragments
Un-filled rifle, scout sniper, shots precise
Starlight scope, with the night vision device
Splendid marksman, that'll shoot the one off the dice
Split a grain of rice, in one shot we kill 'em twice
{*GUNBLAST*}




Peace God (Peace to the gods)
How you God? (Studying 120 right now
Call me back at the God Hour)
The Fuck? It's just the new way of thinking
Light up the broccoli kid
Throw the relish in my back pocket
Keep your eyes open, push your seat back, just flow
That's how we doing it


Bound by honest sword take over the set, rap from here to Quebec
Throw up the TEC, crash your intellect, select a vet
Swimsuit mammal handle, yo every fly vandal go to project
Slam you like Hamill's Whitewater Scandal
Wally sandal just a sample, my niggas fertilize thoughts
Yo mad support drink a quart then bamboo
One nasty can blew, my pen sterile won't perform if I'm not lampable
Asking my man'll get you slapped down, play the anthem
Lit it who with it champagne get it, that's the ticket
Solid nines sounding like crickets snatching worker shipment
Pull her hair, long dick it, we talk right before we left lifted
Just like a long sleeve, guess who ripped it?


Projects (My niggas survive, just like a movin' target)
Projects (Where niggas live and some sell garbage that's)
Projects (Try to escape the flying shells, dodging)
New York projects (I'm living large yo, stop miraging)


Sign of the times, conspiracy to overthrow the mind
Behind every fortune there's a crime
This technique is TEC-9
Blast at any close encounter of the third kind
This be the evil that man do, we dismantle any adversary
Them niggas all thumbs and can't handle my flurry
Hear me, you jam on, you want to scare me
Don't even kid me, shit in my coat aiming at your kidney
Pressure, red hot like chilli pepper
Black 'n Decker hardware avoid the leper
Five o'clock shadowboxer, hold down the sector
Bet your bottom dollar lecture be hard to swallow
007 mark the secret agent
That macks well and gets smart through entertainment
Welcome to the killing fields with Johnny Dangerous
Headbanger boogie niggas going through changes


Projects (My niggas survive, just like a movin target)
Projects (Where niggas live and some sell garbage that's)
Projects (Try to escape the flying shells, dodging)
New York projects (I'm living large yo, stop miraging)


Suck my dick, it's the kid with the fat knob
I bust all into your face, plus it come in globs
Quick get on your knees, with your sweet pussy, let it breathe
Two fingers is all in your hole, think I can fit three
Your pink lips, spreaded and shit, let me throw my dick in
Grab my shit and place it gently on your clit
Ping-pong pussy, wide world the womb
Titties sagging, stomach on some shriveled up prune shit
Too much air in your pussy, you screaming that it's talking you daddy
Fart's breathing out your lips, splashing my dick badly
Use vinegar to try to tighten up your ginger
Almighty dick ran in with a cape, some call him engine
Lightning rod bob, black candy cane attached to God
Thick like a Great Adventure cigar, in your garage
Pregnant pussy have you fall out, like Remy on the house
Watch the teeth for sobbing my shit, you bit it on the couch
Dry pussy leave the friction burns, plus beef I hone
The condom broke, bitch you got AIDS I'm shaking in my bones




Hey, lace your boots up, tracks get looped up
The chocolate deluxe gets scooped up
All my pigeons is cooped up, Wus up, Ws up
If you aint with us, chuck a duce up, and let us do us
Break a promise but not my group up
Veterans is dying and used up
Lets see if they can hang, Im already tying the noose up
Im too hot, if you not, get you stuffed
Get you touched and get you shot or you cut
Young buck Im just trying to toughen you up
Cant let you hustle with us, ya aint struggled enough
Yall been cuddled too much, maybe mothered too much
So the burner giving out loans here is a couple of bucks
Had a couple of scuffs, I aint saying Im perfect
I aint cursing on the rhyme but I wrote it in cursive
Quote the verses, boy I flow with a purpose
Get that proMeth and a soda, come with the purchase


Who is that up in the building?
Hashtag we still win
Raekwon no relation to Chef tho, but still trend
My youngun tell em its them
Wu-Tang is for the children
They bugging, tell em again
Wu-Tang is for the children


Lab with the pole, slide down, Im in the basement counting faces
Drunk on the slouch, count the spaceships
Jewelry to my knee caps, breathe stacks whores & sleestaks
HSBC see me getting g-packs, herringbones mad stones in em
The voice is olive green, three doors Im on bring my goons home
Pumas on, points like unicorns, fuming in uniforms
What you wanna do with me, just sue me homes
Yea Half Mike half Nike, handle got grip
Got monkeys out here ready to flip
We pull a stunt, grab knots, push cops, just for vengeance
For killing that real shit independence
Far glowing like blonde hair, probably be the way we be rolling
Lets cash a check yall bring the broads here
Until the sun burns out, aint nobody eating
We on your block now, Glock up or call the precinct

(Chorus  Method Man & Raekwon)
Who is that up in the building?
Hashtag we still win
Raekwon no relation to chef tho, but still trend
My youngun tell em its them
Wu-Tang is for the children
They bugging, tell em again
Wu-Tang is for the children


Deck performing on the track, call him Jeff Gordon
Im still buzzing this is Hennessey the next morning
The upset talking, Im yes y'allin for cheques
Bossin the set, you acting like my ex calling
Aint that a bitch, not the 5 or the 6
I rock 7 on my back thats Kaepernick
I dazzle like a magic trick, fabulous swordsmen
Sort of like abortion I aint having it
S I ready for action, heavily cashing
We set for whatever, whats happening
Cold like the weather in Aspen, flow everlasting
4, 5, 6, your head is crackin, just a fifth of E&J and a eighth of green
No promethazine but I make them lean
Im running with the real yall chasing dreams
While the crowd go wild for their favorite team

(Chorus x 2  Method Man & Raekwon)
Who is that up in the building?
Hashtag we still win
Raekwon no relation to chef tho, but still trend
My youngun tell em its them
Wu-Tang is for the children
They bugging, tell em again
Wu-Tang is for the children




Come on! Yeah... yeah..
Yo, yo


Wu-Tang, we always in the Spot Lite
Get paper, every night is hot night
We stay tight, we just livin' our life
We just livin' our life


I drink till I'm drunk, smoke skunk with my stinkin ass, smell the funk
Eekin out the pours, cum stain, shitty drawers
Pissin' down ya elevators shaft, no class, writin graf' on ya walls
It be us, fuck ya law, nigga, my cause is "because"
No yin to my yang, it's a black thing
Used to be in chains, now we snatch chains
Took the crack game applied it to the rap game, y'all
Pop quiz, now, what artist hits the hardest?
Get down with the syndrome: retarded
I think it was them swordsmen, place ya chess pieces on the boards and
Take it to square, this ain't no Yacub affair
Or a New World Disorder, got us, fuckin the coal miner's daughter
That y'all, but not us
Fly back, flag a cab and say "check ya"
Next time you see me, say peace and I'll respect ya, Tical




Yo, lights, cameras, don't forget the action
The needle skip, but the turntable scratchin'
Chain blow, bangles, heavy on the cashin'
Same old, Range rove', rainbow Manhattan
Craftmen, captive, still I'm avalanchin'
Holy war, handsome, break 'em off harassin'
Latest fashion, passion, bullets reign gashin'
Flippin' through frenzy, the same Wu-Tang
The Hollywood frame, purple haze stain
Rules of dame, fools, choose to bang
Nigga, you lose, Wu, bruise the game
A few men came, that really held weight
Drop, Chinese bars, stars in fifty-two states
Like, bats out of hell, we crash the gates
Without a base, left the gun powder case
Ladies chase, the hip-hop Babyface




Word up, throw your hands in the air, like you just don't care
Wu-Tang in your atmosphere, everybody say "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"


Mic Capone, it's best to avoid my strike zone
I zone and swing a sword that'll slice stone
Nice clone, but you could never match the born master
Who tore back half the world, and still saught after by
Dick ridin' niggas, and chicks who do ditto
Singin' like the Four Tops, providin' info
See me low, through the Jeep window, the chrome spins slow
Gene-ral on the J.O., survival M.O
For now get wild, similar to Ol' Dirty
A third time felon just hit with over thirty
Note worthy style, have them so thirsty
First degree heat, you quittin' on me
Cold turkey, no mercy




Wu-Tang, put you in the Cobra Clutch, til you give up
Ya'll can live up to, Witty Unpredictable
Street mentality, return of the cavalry
36 Chambers, we off key block
Black on the block, tell ya D.J.'s to quit
M.C.'s, to stop that bullshit
Me, Ghost and Rae, we known to pull shit
Step with the brick, on some Ice Water shit
Wallo's in all colors (now) let's get chips, like
Robbin' the bank, pull up with the new whips
Don't get mad, respect rank
No matter how you gettin' dough, give thanks
Everybody hold up your shanks






I grew up around block parties ready to rock
Behind the rope nigga with my rhymes on cock
The verse shot first nigga who had shit to pop
A bad weather blow the feathers off a hundred flocks
With 70% goose, 30 ducked, get stuck
And each link in your chain is trucked
No ends in this rhyme cipher with nine snipers
Charge of the kiss from the Pied Piper
I live around DJ's, b-boys, MC's
Through rap never thinkin' +Airways+ are TVs
It was strictly all about magnificant rhyme clout
+Rec Room+, 2 dollars with the flyer as we would doubt
Now his wigs pushed back
Name scratched off the plaque, too wild to re-enact
(Yo)


Got to check out +The W+, got to check out-- +The W+
Got to check out +The W+, got to check out-- +The W+


MC's have the right to remain silent
Everything you say can and will be used against y'all muh'fuckers
And Mef can only trust ya as far as I can see ya
Me need ya? That'll be the.. day, ya busta
It gets no rougher when, me and my comrades rush ya
Like red heat with hammers and sickles
I milk like ya baby mama's nipples, got issues
It's just us, so what's what if any can touch us
Then lord strike me down where I stand at now
Wit this bottle of Remy, gettin' fucked up child, listen
The most notable MC, ya source for hip hop quotable MC
Of course it's Tical!




The Princess, the Pope, incest, dope
Choke you by the throat, the chrome handle smoke
The man not for joke, we all out for broke
Plus the herbal that I tote, the murder that I wrote
You can't do me none, my Uzi weighs a ton
I'm comin' from the slum, Wu is number one
I stumbled on the drum, the Gods are troublesome
+Rumble+ when we come, boy you better +Run+, +Run+




Aiyo, it's like this jumpin' out of golden whips
Flashin' mega bricks, outfits, rock ridiculous whips, bitch
Wavy hair, men of the year, bent in the stairs
Sick winter gear, been on position is where
Call him an Asiatic God-body, +Longevity+
Slang rap, you get your whip wrapped
Swing through the hood calmly
Yo what up? Staten Island, Bush, George
Dust your shit off, whips spin off
Get off, slips, which, wiz
Mind di-tects mines, lines lick sick nines
Pick wines, lift up, bill a nigga six flies
Dip wide, dress my shit up, fuck six times, wish mine
Rub lamps, take thousand dollar crystalines





Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang - ONYX!!
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang - ONYX!!


Aiyyo, staircase to stage now, major waves
Tanktop Nautica, flippin your daughter thirty ways
Yeah who want mine? Bent outta shape, one time
Play the mall, starin at your bird of all sunshine
Watch my shit shift, niggas in the back, wigs lift
You know the stats God, don't even ask pa, back slit
Raw drug raps, thug hats and mob hats, spit on that cat
This yellow love nigga fuckin with a rich cat
My shit bad, 5 feet 6, with a crisp hat plush
Throwin down on thirty bricks, niggas is with that
Though, federados locked my man yo, hit lotto
Three-hundred thousand dollars in the bottle, bitch math is Heiml technique, rover in the robe, gold link
You know the code 'Rique, suitcase money, stow heat
Rock Navi's though, hundred dollar bags valet
That nigga crabbed me, gamin himself, like Milton Bradley


Yo the semi-automatic Glock this, unlock this
The weed spots get knocked, it's so hot chicks is topless
Whips are spotless, chrome rims spend obnoxious
You can't knock this, bust a shot you better not miss


X-1 wild out, and make you watch this
'til your eyes turn red with blotches, eatin scraps out the garbage
Unload a cartridge, and bust a cap
X could never trust a cat, Onyx is as hot as it gets
Bitches fuckin for free, is outta the quest'
Blow blood outta your flesh, your body outta your vest


I toss the heat from across the street
Fly you up off your feet, you die livin soft and sweet
Street crime, time is money, nigga don't waste mine
Expose my 9, throwin your shine, your froze in time
Lookin at death, holdin your breath, laid out
On the dance floor, blood and Moet, I'm blowin your set
Trick twenty G's, no sweat, your goin in debt
I'm goin for broke, I'm blowin out smoke, you catch a stroke


Wu-Tang and Baldhedz, Swiss foreheads, leave you all red
X-Milli-on, fully armed, illest beyond your realest form
Bringin the storm, forseein you warned
Nuttin keepin me calm but heat in my palm
Sleep and you gone, you see what I'm on? Creepin outta the dark
Scatter your parts from here to Battery Park


First things first man, you're {fuckin} with the worst
First things first man, you're {fuckin} with the worst
First things first man, you're {fuckin} with the worst
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on a man!


Steel master, grab half the cash fast and bash
And splash yo' class, mash your staff, WHAT?!
Nigga get smacked, you ain't worth a punch, hurt your bunch
Get murked, you front in the wrong circle punk!
Mack clever niggas dat regulate
Catch you on the d-lo in Mecca and Etch-a-Sketch ya
Shake and erase, vacatin your space, breakin your face
Straighten your waist, twist you, and won't miss you
Official Nast and Killa Bee, full blast, get off smash
Pull fast for your stash
Long as the war last, foot up in your ass
Tryin to count more math, bring in the hardcore rap


Yo; we be the mainstream
Supreme rhyme top of the line cuisine fiends
Number one love for thugs queens schemin on cream
My whole team love, the E-cup bras and mobb cars
Killa Sin known for makin niggas reach for the stars
The terrorist lyricist in the midst of the abyss
We cannabis evangelists, iron palms with metal fists
Wu build, like construction and bang, like percussion
All the Planet Battery packs combust and malfunction, what kid?

 - repeat 2X

 Holy shit!! Who the fuck is dat?
 It's John John
 Sticky Fingaz kid, you got my back?
 I got your back cousin
 I got the mack-dozen
 And when them niggas start jumpin, bust back cousin
 Cause it's a new year, time for some new shit
Nowadays rappers dyin over music
 Dead on arrival, we raised in the ghetto
Singin songs for survival, duckin homicidal, you rivals
 Yeah yeah, Onyx/Wu-Tang, on tracks we gangbang
Chitty-bang-bang
 Chitty-chitty-bang-bang
Hot Nix' spit flame, lava pump through my veins
Caught in the zone, home on the range
 Aiyyo you rang on ferocious, atrocious
We got that supercalifragalisticexpiala-
 - dope shit!
 Eight ball in the corner pocket
 We snatch wallets off the white collared
The Big Apple forever rotted
Narcotics hunt the hard target, Hot Nix'
 SO WHAT THE BUMBACLOT?!


Pop shit, we do the knowledge
To shark niggas, once bitten
Major swingers heavy hittin
Poly your kitten, throw up your mittens
Stop bitchin, no slippin, no pot to piss in
The meltin pot's boilin hot now in Hell's Kitchen


Yo, yo, Sticky Fingaz, one of the illest motherfuckers
BELIEVE DAT!! My moms don't raise no suckers
I slap rappers, turn 'em into singers
Touch somethin of mine and you'll have NINE fingaz!

 Enough said, let's paint this whole fuckin town red
 And RIP .. they whole crew to a shred!
 I got cold blood
 I pull yo' plug
 I hold, bust
 Show no love
 I'm so bugged
 Shoot yo' home up
 And shoot up the whole club
 We throw slugs


You ain't no thug!
I earned every God damn penny that I got
Son I'm rollin shotgun in the convertible
I wish a nigga W-W-W-WOULD
Try to fuckin jack me, I'll MURDER YOU!!!



Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang - ONYX!!
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang - ONYX!!




Yeah, yeah, check the flavor of this

Yo see my pinky? See my thumb?
See my fist? Ya better get the hell outta here


Help me Rhonda, help help me Rhonda


This is the Wu-Tang Clan, we wanna bomb ya


Brothas get petro when Ason appears
When I step into your atmos', here comes the fear
Can I get riggy-diggy-raw, huh? Man!
Who's knows your shields, yes the man I am
Which means I'm clean, another slang on your brain
Forget about all that handy flocks and chains
I'm popular, straight from the opera
I rocks on a nigga cuz I'm about ta
Blow up! With the jaws, the party I'm in there
Ya step to the Shaolin, throw the blunt to the rear
What time is it? It's time to whip the whip
Mad difference to the pockets, feelin legit
Cuz when I come out this way, I don't play
To put a brother away, Chk-BLAOW! Blown away
Give it to ya raw, my style is hardcore
Don't funk the jaw, Wu-Tang jaw
Shit is about to get funky in here
I die for this cuz you're shot when I'm there
Whoever's with me, you better step with me
Right now, if not, another beat down


The Wu is comin through!


Yo it might sound dramatic, I'm a rap fanatic
The mic is a habit, I gots to grab it
Whipped it, flipped it then I sticked it
Enter my pocket once I've rocked it
Sound is known as the high sin dome
Like smoke from a blunt when it enters the dome
The deliver the method to improve my effort
Of my flow when I got buckwild with the record
MC's laid up, they heard my flavor
Got a bomb whip like my next door neighbor
Never the effect of 28 got me paranoid
Girls are somethin I can't avoid
Gimme gimme gimme, I stay when I'm simmy
But I won't say a gift without somethin on my Jimmy
This is the slicksta when I gets ya sister
Flipped ya, hit her then I'm quick ta
Live New York with a two dime talk
Then who keeps walkin through the Times speed talkin
Those who hit the, flow seems to get ya
Hit you and then Big Prince come and stick ya
And I'll be havin you, runnin up the Avenue
My rhymes that be grabbin you and beats that be stabbin you
Some fail to fuckin voodoo, the drunken monk
If it ain't loud enough, pop ya trunk




So what you gonna do?

"Wu-Tang crew" -] Ol' Dirty Bastard *cut and scratched a few times*



(You know they're killers themselves
People die for them
You know, guys that I fooled with were killers themselves
Want it?, how you want it? stop that!, stop that!)

These are the men who lead the crime families of America
I control 26,000 men
Except for dope, we operate in all aspects of organized crime
And if there's one thing I'm sure of, it's that drugs destroy your mind
And destroy your home
In the end it'll only lead our country into ruin)


We eat fish, tossed salads and make rap ballads
The biochemical slang lord'll throw the arrows in the dope fiend
Vocal chords switch laser beams my triple sevens
Broke the slot machines out in Queens, Grey Poupon is rebel on rap
Smack on, swing like batons, most want niggas smoked like Hilshire Farms
Check the gun we sew, underneath my shoe lies the tap
That attract bow-legged bitches with wide horse gaps
In steel mills iron he'll smoke the blow on Duns
You run heroins, Primatine mist is afraid of my lungs
Turn my channel, it'll blow your whole bench off the panel
Like 80 roman candles that backfired then slammed you
Every day is like a video shoot, check this shit
I take you back to Playboy, stash guns and whips
Picture afro, big shish-ka-bobs and daishikis
1000 civil marched blazed their fists in early sixties


Now check this one, you must have been stupid to miss this one
'Donna shogunnin' flip a ton of fashion
Destination be the cash when I step past one
Don't make me blast one, I'm cold like Eskimo flow
Cappadonna stay chillin' take shots of penicillin
Clean out and let the steam out, she fiend to blow out
But I'm equipped with mad white, Morris The Rap got nine lives
I'll take a few hundred-thousand dollar dives
And then I still never go down
Until the last round I shine
When RZA do his thing motherfucker, I'ma do mine


Now, where I come from cats be carryin' Marryin' drug money
Fuck up your wife, get four to life, claim we handling
Midtown niggers scramblin', moving examine the fly shit
Plus quick to buy shit Chef, yeah, you know the whole gods
Asterick, Fidel Castro suits plus depositin' cash rule big time
Play it like Canadian wine, RZA 's the rhyme now, the sacredness of
One's true mind Now let's get colorful like money green
High roller coaster, Sosa, million dollar nigga roaster
Yeah, GOD, be havin' my whole steez laced
Now let's wrap our tapes, connect dots
Aim Glocks train style, Figaro fly jewel
Tri-color Cubans swerving we'll pow with Germans in Suburbans
24 niggas with vests's on, my own restaurant
Dons sendin' my sons membership forms
They still gettin' this paper scraper
Fake haters from Jamaica, wizards be passing like Lakers
And if you comin' from Lex, Lewis, Rich Liberace
Fetus style and block your goals like hockey




Still living by the code too many pretty women still living by the...
I'm just tryna get a meal
When I started rhyming wasn't tryna get a deal I was tryna get a feel
Homocide housing bodies lying in the Hill, man they nothing with me dying in the field especially when I'm tryna pay the bills
A lot of y'all relying on the steel
And see the court denying your appeal
If y'all don't know, nothing you better know its real
If it work like a workshop better know the drill
I'm past childish games, y'all just tryna take me outta my game
And calling my black women out of their name
I'm serious stay out of my brain
Understanding my slangs, Fast and Furious, stay out of my lane
Boy I'm hot, kids be calling me Blaze
In the industry I'm not, they be calling me slave
I ain't tryna burn the spot, but I'm setting my ways
I'm just a Product of the block and the city I'm raised
I'm still living by the code
Too many pretty women still living by the stroll daddy pimping them for dough
Early in the morning cops kicking in the do'
Man I Think somebody's snitching on the low
I caught my father sniffing on that snow
That's when he tried to tell me things are different than before
Kids don't listen any mo', thats fo' sho'
We used to ask permission from my fo'
Ain't no food up in the kitchen cause we broke
I ain't tryna miss Another, meal cause love it get you killed
And if it dont your baby mother will
But y'all ain't recognizing that is, real untill that undercover pulls his shield and now it's kinda late to cut the deal
So I ain't gotta tell you how I feel
While im tryna get my pockets stuffed with hundred dollar bills
I should've went to school and get a skill
But it wasn't in my future so I stealed, that's why I got this Ruger in ya' grill


Cracker treasure chest is one of the best
Now, feel the force of the full Court press
I apply to kiss the death, something for real the realness
Untouchable, Eliot Ness, you select of vet
Take me off the bench, I suppose to lynch,
The angel in the air you can smell my stench
Soldiers in the trench, moving east to west
I gave you a note, you can keep the rest
RIP the whole coast when I heat the flesh
At the greek fest, hit a couple of bars
Smash rips on strips like bumber cars
You're amongst the odds, with lies in the pelly
The baby, nine, the size of a celly
Now it's a dilemma like Nelly and Kelly
Milk Pirelli Tower when I peel it in a hurry with a fist of fury
Martini with a cherry is very necessary when I make it to the top
I'mma pop Halle Berry Staten Island fairy where the legends were made
In the staircase throw a rap grenade
Take it back in the day, get clapped for your chain
"F" the blood bath it will be half of the pain
He is a high grand bullet women call him daddy
Fish tank shoes jump out the Caddy
Grand finale yo the champ is here
The cameras glare under the chandelier
While you standing there, like you can hold it down
Its nine of us all of us rock the crown
Tear it down down to the last compound
New York mixed with a Compton style
Roll bonkers wild, on the stomping ground
Lay down the carpet when I'm walking down the isle
Then Telephone  keep stalking the child
Four misdemeanor now I'm going to trial
So secluded in exile like my sex while
Private jet style who's the livest vet now`
Pass me a wet towel don't get Vexed now
I ring it your chest when I let the tech growl


We used to rock um, leather gooses
With sheep skin coats and bombers
British Walkers, sharp skinned tailor made
Playboys black swede, three finger rings name plate rope chains
DVD, nylon cazal frames and matching with the Kangol hat
You couldn't have it, brother might snatch it
Flashback 1 90 E with the mock neck
Lee suit 25 nickels we shh
Fresh blue on white Pumawith the track Nike
Shell toe Adidas with the  no laces
Late night summer time jam we in the park
Allah Math cutting, DJ spitting his dart
Sergio Cassini brown swede bally
Jay crossed Town, 
Fresh leather Went to wether maximum spoiler kid
Legendary Duece flick Slick Rick
Run DMC, Jam master Jay
Wu-Tang Clan, Scott La Rock, KRS-ONE
Peace to like Pun
I had a Jaz-O tape, me and my crew
Walk the avenue sky was blue half past two
It's the Cold Crush Moe Dee, Treacherous Three, Spoonie G
Bizzy Killa Bee, yeah yeah
See crack never kept me high longer than five minutes
Wallaby Clarks  of course silk and linen
Jumbos two for five come and get it
Mamma cries tears of fear when I was wilding son
Please dont wear that, people are getting killed for that
Latin quarter union Square you had to be there
The fever, MC glory, ripping the armoury
This is Hip Hop to me, and for all of y'all, this is Wu-Tang Clan
Signing off, you know how we do forever


Ay yo I gotta be around this music it's therapeutic
Lick my first  blunt off the day then start the movement
I'm chilling in a room with a view, there's always room for improvement
So I grab my coat and go and prove it
Its me against the world, you can find me in the streets
You don't spot me in the lobby probably find me in a freak
Cop Ferraris, the law be in the lining of my seats
Tryna put me in a line up till I wind up in a beast
That's the belly, how dare they tryna tell me when to eat?
With this plate of food barely in my reach
My team shoot dice, we used to shoot skelly in the streets
Wore the same pelli pelli for a week
But now we live the life, its such a good Life
I wish that I could live it twice
I'll probably make the same wish my wife
It's Wu-Tang Clan always collect cheddar
Proper education always correct error


Crime scene, coppers and sirens helicopters
High beam the tension is Rising
Fiends keeping they pipes Clean
This is what life's mean?
A dollar and a dream everybody wants nice things
The kid was only 19, hole in his chest now, he's fighting
For his last breath to seeing death is frightening
The grip on the ghetto is tightening
You try to do the right thing, and they do you just like King
Now I can hear the night scream sirens and light beams
 bad shots, hitting people that they didn't mean to pop
The neighbourhood's in shock, block extremely hot
Another black teen shot is a normal routine for cops
They should've got good grades, work the minimum wage
Now they lying on the stretcher with nothing in them to save
Keep it ghetto, and whatever ghetto you at
Just don't love the ghetto, cause the ghetto don't love you back


Gotta be around this music it's therapeutic
First fresh thought to tell you so clear
When I'm Walking my head, There's a voice that talks
In my ear, I can hear it so clear (you Think im bugging right)


The average man, wouldn't last that lang
She like to work out run Marathons
She wear, tight skirts with no panties on
She's a 6 foot 1 bronze amazon
Saying, complaining about all the good men gone
I'm from Babylon she reach the 
Holding jails in the nail salons
She rock Coco Chanel her smell was strong
With skin like velvet, she rocked my bags
She gave, no 
She a spread eagle at the tip of the bed
She rubbed on her legs this is what I said
Rap music is therapeutic to me
Rap music is therapeutic to me


Ay yo You ain't lived 'till you made your first million
And top models wanna pop out yo Children
I thought I told you Wu tang is for the Children
Way Before rap moving crack in your building
Yeah, now whats the price of rice in China
These women tryna raise the price of her vagina
Me, Im tryna live and get the grinder
Like Diddy, but I ain't tryna give the Shyne up
Pop pop pop off no question
See Ol' Dirty like it raw no protection
When the kid hold court no objections
Meth needs his Money out the door no exepction
I go hard in the paint on a rapper
I go harder on a Xanax and Viagra
You Think im tripping, aiming the trick and
But keep a snow Bunny in the kitchen I'm the master like Killa






What y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
This '97
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to '79


I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultraviolet shine blind forensics
I inspect you, through the future see millennium
Killer Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets, Queen Bees ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block


As the world turns, I spread like germ
Bless the globe with the pestilence
The hard-headed never learn
This my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life standing firm
On foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
Transform into the Ghost Rider
A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire
Who got my back in the line of fire holding back?
What? My peoples if you with me, where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
What the blood clot? We smoke pot and blow spots
You want to think twice? I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums


I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
Vocabulary 'Donna talking, tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what? Run for your brother kid
Run for your team and your "six can't rhyme" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme, your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts, paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought
I got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God


The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang


Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape Hell globe spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anaesthesias
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings


March of the wooden soldiers, C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square we stay in gold like Flair
Escape from your dragon's lair
In particular my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat bass lines on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck, I'm ducking five-year probation


War of the masses, the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song


The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none


Yo Yo Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink, you had a Navy green
Salamander fiend, bitches overheard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cork-pop convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese, is that so?
Ceaser needs the greens, it's Earth
Ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz


Aiyo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer, Blue-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor world tranquilizer
Adjust the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening
Guaranteed made 'em jump like Rod Strickland






Weve just received a report that New York City is under attack by swarms of killer bees. Theyve been seen approaching from Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. We urge you to stay in your homes at this time, as we will be bringing you up-to-the-minute information. This just in: Police are reporting that theres a man on top of a skyscraper, ready to jump. Im told that he is possibly Ol Dirty, a member of the Wu-Tang Clan. The police suspect that there could be some connection between this old dirty man, and the killer bees


What y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me
I'm the Osiris of this shit

I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits tremendous
Ultraviolet shine blind forensics
I inspect you, through the future see millennium
Killer Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths

The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums


I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
Vocabulary 'Donna talking, tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what? Run for your brother kid
Run for your team and your "six can't rhyme" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme
Your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts
Paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought, I got the fashion
Catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God


The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang


Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape Hell globe spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anaesthesias
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings


March of the wooden soldiers
C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square we're staying gold like Flair
Escape from your dragon's lair
In particular my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat bass lines on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck, I'm ducking five-year probation


War of the masses, the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song


The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple
Stab wounds and leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none


Yo, yo yo; fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink, you had a Navy green
Salamander fiend, bitches overheard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cork-pop convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese, is that so?
Ceaser needs the greens, it's Earth
Ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz


Aiyo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer, Blue-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor world tranquilizer
Adjust the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening
Guaranteed made 'em jump like Rod Strickland




Plush whips and rollies, ice chains and stogies
No bitch could hold me, in this Thug World


I hold it with the bolo grip, solo control the strip
Behold, P.L.O. the click, man, it's over with
So quick, notice how we bang with the knuckles bare
Wu-Tang, keep it fresh like tupper ware
The Jungle, Animal House, gat in your mouth
Polly with the wild life, cannibal out
Give this five course meal in effect, reel to reel or cassette
Or with the mask on, peelin' the tech
Killah Hill, man, you feelin' my set, feelin' my rep
And I'm met, with the top down, wheelin' the 'Vette
Scoop me downtown, cop the brown and back to the bids
Twist a blunt in front of Jake and still mash on the strip
Face sick with the rap shit, stacking them chips
In the pits, stick shit, cats packing them grips
Bad bitch with the black six, after my dick
She like, 'this your pussy,' then she splashed my clique
Not a fake, not a fraud, see my name on the wall
Niggas straight, like an inmate, try'nna make the board
Snake waiting, dudes came for sure, I lay law
Stay raw, cause a 'massacre' with no 'chainsaw'
Half y'all talk about it, but you don't want war
See my wolves eat the bones and we still want more
We be foaming at the mouth, even, I doubt we leave without eating
So without reason, pounds are squeezing
The lifestyle of fiends and beans, big dreams and CREAM
Bitches ride like the Scream Machine
For a taste of it, the chicks strip, clean out the jeans
Next thing she was smuggling coke between the seams

 + (RZA)
If real niggas is listening, the life we living in, is wrong
(Witty Wu-Tang is unpredictable, Witty Wu-Tang is unpredictable)
Back for transitions, to save us from harm
We in the race for time... so we won't lose our mind
But if we run the race like a thug
We would lose that mind that we made of


You kept the weapon concealed like a magician's secret dollar bill
Liable to pull a knife from out of his heel
Snatch the sword from the rock with one hand
One finger, bzzz, turn ya body to sand
You'll be hoping you'd be Spidey, to get away from this
You be hoping you be whitey when the judge get pissed
One man, can't uplift the land
Like Method Man standing on the hands of fans
See the Captain and Lieutenants, true descendant
Splendid, unprecedented, hip hop vintage
Started from the park benches, before the NARCs could snitch us
He was God Cypher Divine, trying to spark the wizards






Yo.. yeah
Don't erase none of that good shit in the beginnin
Yo.. spill drinks on ya, get stank on ya
Yo.. yo.. pinky ring shit, yo
That pinky ring shit, yo


It's that pinky ring shit, the legend of masked kid
Shoot out the speakers when my guns get jurassic
Superbad, who am I? Dolemite classic
The vandal's back, hands on Angela Bassett
I handle my plastic, gunplay I mastered
No coke, dope mixed down with acid on record
Broken down and crafted in seconds
Lady's choice, the golden voice still peppered
Better, respect it, bitch believe
I pull rabbits out the hat, tricks up my sleeves
I air out the showroom, the shit can breathe
Fix your weave, behold my expertise


I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back
I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back


Take it back to the peoples, leanin' gettin' rec room punch
We in them authentic alley switchin joints
Major general niggas, five stars
Both arms rock when coke dropped we read a hundred niggas palms
Silencers, garbage bags of hash
For every cop we paid retired now the nigga on smash
Gash you out your burner fast
You swing down hatin me now respect get your fingers off the glass




Yo what the fuck yo?! Yo what the fuck y'all comin for?
Get the fuck away from my door!
We got big guns in here, coke over there
With blue bag and E pills stashed under the chair
And there's Boss Hog black and white pit with the pink lips
Stan thought he was soft 'til he bit his fingers
The shit had me dyin yo, big fat nigga bleedin
Big cat nigga all season
On the beach truck, stuck with Hawaiian ice
Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought FUBU
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
18 karat rap between noodles




Up at Killa Bee headquarters, four whips just pulled up
I saw Johnny sippin Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin off the hip
I sit took three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead king, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ".. Any Means Necessary"


John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all get shot


New York, New York, legendary rhyme boss
Code name Charlie Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
You crash-tests can't measure the threat
I dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah
Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin, feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself
The Noble, Sir I mass mogul
Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals


This is grown man talkin, coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect father Eton with Addies
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see


From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets




{*scratching "Suuuuuuuue" until fade*}




Apocalypse Now, mind over matter
Next batter be Tical, put it on a platter
How much uncut raw shit we dealing with?
Murder track what? Slang killing it, touched
You feeling it in your bloodstream
Deadly Venomous elixir hammer like Sledge that be Sister
All In Together Now, follow me the Mister
Mef Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh
Death come in the scripture, 2001
Bring the rap Armageddeon, let it be known
When you walk up in this Dead Zone, with all that wack shit
Now you know you dead wrong, one thousand lashes


Detonate that, pussy Massengil rap cleanse that
The kids rank, snatch collars off while riding off
Float boat big boys, Oakland A's stashed away blades
Ventilation let the sharks Animaze
Something shiest like seven butcher knives
Rolling Rover style twice, finger itchy like lice, hair fell out
Something to conquer, stomp ya like that cat Blanka
Toy Tonka truck, ten carat on ya monster
Ring rocky like fuck switch sides like water rides
The DAT bubble life preserve the other guys
Now fuck y'all act wilder
The style wilder than a praying mantis, chilling like
(long inhale)


As my brothers and I reign rebellious, changing
The courses of time, devils no longer exist
As God Cipher Divine, all minds one, no question
Now check it
Perhaps we can go through Lessons
Or might shot me a pussy protesting
Coming with that lip professing, you must take Allah for fool
Where's his Jewel? Was he using Mathematics as a tool?
Tell me, the struggle is God and I came to build
Shit is so real, inside you distilled
Back in the form of mist, you wishing you did the Knowledge
Before speaking, seeking, where you went wrong
And why would I bring you such physical harm?


Mind arson, my squadron surround the SoundGarden
Guns for hire plus you under fire and a target
Sniper in the cypher, I Pied Piper
Move the housing by the thousand, I watched out the Chrysler
Bombs strike ya like the Mighty Thor, blast the door
Recite a page like a tidal wave crash the shore
Two pulls, I'm wild like mechanical bulls
Pack a full house, it's girls night out, pull a handful
Heavenly laced, stimulation make it feel slow paced
I motivate and await my sober state


Magnificent, heavenly the God stay bent
Five Percent, Range whipping, Soul Controller of the lynch
Macking phone rings, Stephen King drama down at Danzine
My mood swings, suplexed off the rope, magazine
Coconut juice, walnut colored shoe, ninth annual
Moses lost his sandal hiding the manual
Blowing evangel bugging off of Bon Jovi hits
Grandma Lowvey, famous murder weapon was a trophy
Seeds posing in Osh Kosh, guzzle Grolsch
Sabotage massage rap bandit at large
Wolverine Carnation Milk, Wu denim jeans
Thurston Howell the Third, kid's back on the scene
Call it chopped meat cause every word is choppy
Malachi crunch all crows to death, Kobayashi couldn't stop me
Getting caught up in my world, Hagen-Dazs swirl
Back flip and then a twirl, cave your whole world in



* samples were not cleared for the official album release


Y'know? General, general! Word out...
Yeah...
Aiyyo man.. you poppin fuckers
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


It's just rules with beats - you clown niggas can't rule the streets
We set shop! Wu-Tang, we rule the East
Taking over the block!
"From the gate now!"
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
Aiyyo, it's just rules with beats - you clown niggas can't rule the streets
We set shop! Wu-Tang, we rule the East
Taking over the block, you can't fuck with the block!
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Aiyyo, I stay funky and piley, blue Excelero
They lookin for me, what the fuck you behind me for?
Stressing everything I breathe on
I'm from the boulevard where niggas get jacked and peed on
Whatever homey, we more lavish
I might sneak you in the crib, see my lasers and glasses
Try to get my come up on
Yo, and when you see me, you know I got my "come up" arm on
Cartier called me up, robbery here
We got your seed in the back of the Beemer starving
We like lion killers, catch me on stage with the gauge
In my right hand, grenade and this leather bomber
I scout money, you know we hungry and talk funny
Coughing out corner rappers, don't never walk up on me
I write with only insane Malkovich
My troops gave me money to clown with them, fuck it
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


My first gun was a .32, back before uh!
Graduated to the .38, maybe a nine
I prefer the fo' five, stay alive
Techs held the crack gank in '88
8 oz. straight from Florida, the best temp
Camouflage vest, repping the set
Wu on the east wing, twenty-ten, sexy bad
We up at Spain with that thing thing, my crew strong
We take no search for your party dunn, you know how I run
Spray places, cover faces, beat cases
A big mouth will get your teeth knocked the fuck out
Keep a nunchuk, take money, stay ninja
I injure, any motherfuckin contender
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Hey bitch, your time's up! Go finish them rhymes up
All my soldiers is lined up, my corners is crimed up
Niggas know where to find us, settin the grind up
Police checkin them pies up, my rims are shined up
Wu! We on the rise up, crops supplied up
Plottin niggas demise up, boxed in conduct
Scratch we got 'em sized up, and when the East is in the house
You, you, you, you, you...
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


On the side of the projects, grey skully, bubble 'Lo goose
Mac 11 tucked in front of the belly
Prestigious moves, we killin 'em, hoes we drillin 'em
We like George Foreman out in the streets, we grillin 'em
In the van, .45's and dilly's, ready to slam it
House arrest box is goin off, Tony got grams
Gotta bath tub full of white, lay in it like Sam Montana
Tune 'em out, to blow out, chop 'em like fans
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


This is boulevard hard, lounging in your black car
Camouflage rat guard on "Stomp the Yard"
I-N-S spit monster bars, flip long regards
My click dons bitch, y'all are frauds
I get it in like Tim off the glass
Slamming my name, I'm like the prez, sending men off to blast
What I spit, make 'em spend all their cash
I'm so Wu, so new that I ain't ripped off the tags
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


RZA done birthed us, some curse on purpose
I'm the grouch, my mouth is a circus
Burner plus a good learner, don't need a hood
All I need's a good burner, Nat Turner
Snake rat murderer, all I hear is turf talk
Rack rooms full of goons with bullet wound birthmarks
From the first spark, you heard my response
(Wu-Tang!) More results talkin 'bout whole crew's mission just lost
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Out the beehive, you dip and you dive
But you still can't survive, you can't see past five
Check the outlook, this is not in the book
You bein dragged across the floor while your 'dro in my hook
Lyrical joust, found all the deal off the books
Steve Rif gave the nod to Universal, good look
Still spit poison venom, Red Monkey and Wu dem
Have any dudes seen the condos? It's all 'em
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Put my +clan in da front+, +reunite+ 'em
Make 'em all R.S.V.P., if they want it, we don't invite 'em
No beef, less talk and more action
We parole as a whole, we'll send you back in fractions
Break through fanatic, low crates deep in attics
The Abbott pulled out a .45, looped with static
I scrolled through the menu then rolled to the venue
The dress code is armor all, put a hole up in him
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)




If only we can lay our hands on that vixen Yu Shin Hua
Then all our problems will be over...
Yu Shin Hua!


You thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed


The quintessence, father of the hip hop renaissance
My slang been around before baton and Benetton
I've been on, fingerprint, two finger tips
So when I squeeze the rubber grip, release the clip, then leave the clip
C-Cypher Pigs can't identify it
The true and living God, son, we exemplify it
The most complicated 'formance of life, we simplify it
Bzzz, don't knock it til you try it
Flying dagger, make 'em stagger, then I take a swagger
Ice cold Jgermeister, take a drag of
Humboldt County kush, slide like the Nike swoosh
Bruce Almighty got more problems than Spidey, look
Old Brooklyn, Putnam Avenue crook, I've been tooken
All around the world, rooked it then, drive back in Brooklyn
Good looking, son, yo, son, bring the hook in
You can never find Zig weak spot, stop looking




From the continents to Croatia, I'll flame a lamester
With the new slang, much more to show ya
These rocks change, Glock fully, hot pellets
Have me running through the hall, it's on, like you being chased by the relic
Can't nothing harm me, yo, I move through any project
With logic, few semi's, hide in the cockpit
Scream out, Shallah and I'mma tap in, harder than Tinactin
Don't try to play the fella, I'll blacked in
Moving all miraculous, the slap smiths of the rap game
Say my name backwards, you'll get back changed
Black man, black hooded, moving through the city
Like you Batman, still you so pussy, like Catwoman
Don't bother the Legion, more squeezing, more reason
To light a new block up, cause me to cement shit
Powerful block shoppers and all niggas getting that guac
Dare you to try to find my weak spot


You thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed

Verse 3: GZA
I stay on the 64 squares, while controlling the center
Trading space for material, the time zone I enter
It's calculated by movement, from pushed pieces
Advances in development, once the pawn reaches
The 8th ranked, now heavily armed with a tank
My opponent's base is threatend, soldiers cut with shanks
Moved all my small pieces, MC's are driven back
Unable to avoid capture from the attack
Such movement, is naturally quite unsound
Men is badly placed upon dangerous grounds
Loosening their position, before they were strongly posted
Before the double rooks had approached it
They must've been quick to ignore the principles
Rock a V and an effective God is invincible
A strategic plan, just the way I envisioned it
Many fallen soldiers in complete imprisonment


You thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed


I tell you, right, right, right, in ya muthafuckin' face
Muthafucka, you know, well, you know muthafuckin' well
Whenwe don't play that shit, or, I don't play that shit
That's just Wu-Tang. You know, I'm the nigga
That...that, give it to ya raw
When I said "First things first, man, you fuckin' with the worst
I be stickin' pins ya head, like a fucking nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with the fat rugged stack
Shame on you, when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zu"




Yo, yo, P. Diddy might run this city
But I walk down the block, flash my -- (Yo RZA, hold up, hold up)
Yo what's up son? (Yo, we gotta remix this joint)
Yo, come on then (Yo, 40, it's on you)


I gotta tell you, we ain't next to nice, made you nice
Don't get your head cracked, don't get your tomato diced
I'm the coldest M.C. in the game
And I shouldn't have to say it, you squares know my name
Pimped with all the slang in the game, that they recite
Every time I open mouth, these suckas bite
I bust like a Dutch Master, blast you if a have to
Somebody call the pastor


We got realest long beats
Flows stop, make the beat go ---
I'm in the Coup with the seats low
Even on the East Coast, I gotta keep my heat close
We leaving holes in your cheap clothes
My only job is to stop imposters, watch the mobster
Cop the Boxster, drop the top and squat
Switchin' through lanes, this is the group thing
Cause this is Wu-Tang and Horseshoe Gang, what up?


We pop, we brawl, get money till the day we fall {please believe it}
(We pop, we brawl, gettin' money til the day we fall) {please believe it}


Yo, I Bonecrush' ya, like I ain't 'never scared' brother
That baby mother's like baby powder and there another
M.C. does this cutter, when I cut, I split jugglers
When my teeth get yellow, I spit butter
By now you know my name, man, who hold the belt, now
Plus who hold his self down, all with the same hand
Now what's the game plan, let money change hand
I'm still champ, and white boys still can't hang


Yo, P. Diddy, might run this city
But I walk down the block, flash my Glock on the jiggies
An ounce of chronic, crushed up in the ziplock
Outside the club, is packed up to the gridlock
Dime piece wizes, high heels and the flip flops
Real players pop with those cringy wrist watch
Big bouncers the size of Sasquath
Tuck riff with the rim that'll make your eyes pop




Do I have to assassinate them?
Man, I leave 'em with no altimatum
I ain't hate 'em, I ain't make 'em make mistakes
But I'mma break 'em, the cops, could I shake 'em
Or will they catch me and charge me
On the streets I put something in ya, that'll send you to God
Meet my man, we don't have to roll, candy when we ride
She love it, when I give her, pull her panties to the side
Bullet loco, you might catch me breaking and entering
Mama, I had to jump bail right before the sentencing


Get it up in 'em, cool, that strip and claimin' the set
And quick to Sway the Tech, ya'll straight bang and connect
It's the dog, ya'll get it off, on your backpack and blue marker
Chronic smoke cougher, I don't shoot walker
Dub Sizzle on the remix, the last to speak
Now it's all coming together like sweaty gas leaks
Fo' sure, a nigga will say, 'yo, it's Dub C'
40, Crooked I, RZA, Method Man and Jayo





.. {*jail interlude*} ..


Son I just slapped my bitch
Came to my crib 'bout half past six
Kid's in shitty diapers, no food was fixed
I was like, "Yo bitch - why ain't no food fixed?"
She on the phone with her friend talkin bout dick
I snatched the receiver from that bitch like CLICK
She got all excited, tryin to throw fit
Swung at me then I swung back - BITCH!


What you in fo'? It happened in the club
With some thugs I was at the bar, smokin bud, hollerin at love
Ladybug was playin in my peachfuzz, she was
Talkin hot fudge, can't nobody do it like she does
In the hot tub - didn't know her man was in the club
And honey dove never mentioned that she had a scrub
It must have been the drugs or the alcohol buzz, had me
Shootin my game like a thirty-eight snub baby
Let's cut a rug, that's when I felt a shove
What the blood, dude actin like he won the Golden Gloves
I get one for holdin grudge, but if this kid throw a slug
I'mma throw a slug - that's how we be rollin cuz
I see this dud tryin to play me like a pair of Lugz
Big John Stud, Goldschlager in a golden mug
What you in fo'?

.. {*jail interlude*} ..


I'm locked down for tryin to hold my block down since a shorty
The Old Earth was like, "Street put the Glock down"
I was raised in slums, love how the gun sounds
And now I got one - c'mon, who wanna front now?
Sunup to sundown, ready for showdown
Whoever wanna throw down, the gangsters better slow down
Wake up, before you be in a cell with forty of us
(What you in fo'?) In for murder over money love and lust
(What you in fo'?) In for life, don't let me tell you twice
I might bang you twice and take double the life
What you in fo'?


Jail status - get up
Wash a nigga mattress faggot, you heard about me right?
Pass off them packages cat, you gotta eat to live
Meet the crib; got a hundred starvin niggas in here big
So pop off, drugs that's props, bring in
Glocks we call 'em oxes
Be a real live nigga, swing mops and shit, take over shit
Fuck the C.O.'s, aiyyo Boo, I need clothes
Slide brokers where phones get hid
Fuck with Russians and Latins
The most powerful marble black slipper style
Goin out thrashin niggas, kicks get thrown
Big sizes, sleep in your boots, 4000 rugged F Troops
Notarized wigs, lay six months
That's alright dog, make it home Lord
Heard you admit it in the box, slid it under walls
Bang monster anger
Bop through the halls with bangers
Live God like the Abbot of all chambers..

.. {*jail interlude*} ..



Fuckin around, its that the fuckin clown?
40 Cent? (uh-huh)
If you real thing, cuz you was here
You'll be fuckin dead, you hear me cock-sucker, DEAD!


Yo, yo, yo
Who the hell is 50 Cent? Crook with a deal
Keep talkin, you gon' meet a crook with a steel
You really want beef, I'mma hand you war
Got big guns, shit you never seen before
Just a no-name nigga, seekin the rep
'bout to take aim, spit a hot flame in your chest
Although everythin was cool, had to start wildin
Front all you want, but not on Shaolin
Point blank, simple and plain, you small change
Tear you up out of the frame from close range
Fake 50 Cent tryin to face the best
Wanna impress me? Let me see you fake your death
Until then, you herb, don't deserve respect
What possesed you? Who gave you the nerve to flex?
God bless you, I'mma lay your soul to rest
Think about it next time you'll pose a threat


2x
Who the hell is 50 Cent? Cornball frontin
'nother studio thug, ain't hurtin nothin, nigga
And your raps ain't built for that
On the real, niggas get killed for that


So you wanna stick the Gods for they funny-ass rings?
How dare you? Clip your wings and straight aim
You be careful, how you mention the name
Speaks codes, I violate your clan like parole
Who want it? Run in your lab without a warrant
What you gon' do now? Got your ass cornered
Feel a squad closing in, from all angles
Hit you, split you from your ass to your ankle
Let my dogs eat your food, hear my wolves howl at the moon
Lock down your body, leave the room
You fake fuck, wanna start with us?
Anybody ever told you, you talk too much?
Niggas want mine, I'mma put five on your bucket
Shine on the wrist, cost more than your budget
Who you? Face it, your whole camp doo-doo
Wanna get it on, nigga do you, fake fuck


2x
Who the hell is 50 Cent? Cornball frontin
'nother studio thug, ain't hurtin nothin, nigga
And your raps ain't built for that
On the real, niggas get killed for that


Yo, I lay long enough, for you cowards to eat
It's time to apply pressure, devour the streets
Yo, it seems another crab, like runnin his mouth
Where he at? Point him out, and I'm callin him out
Make his chick nod the head like she's suckin me off
Keep it raw, meat combat with the dog, dustin me off
No joke, you ain't never seen gun smoke
Nickel pump bastard, stick to playin jump rope
Who the bosses? Power like thoroughbred horses
With more guns than armed forces
You ain't ready, overnight joker
Strip you like poker, your bullshit's over
Give it to me raw, I want mine the foul way
Small change in this game, nigga like a child's play
Motherfuckin coward


2x
Who the hell is 50 Cent? Cornball frontin
'nother studio thug, ain't hurtin nothin, nigga
And your raps ain't built for that
On the real, niggas get killed for that


Fuckin 40 Cent
4 dimes and a nickel, God
I challenge you, thats right
Fuckin cheesy boy
Cream Team niggas see you boy
You better have your shit out
You better have your shit right, nigga
YouknowI'msayin?
We the flavoury niggas
We fuckin flavoury niggas
You fuckin coward
Trying to come in this shit
You know I'm sayin'?
We out here, you just small change



 + (samples)
(Make me yours) He get out of line, break his fucking arm...
You know how it go (What am I supposed to say? Yeeaaah)
You know, word up, not playing the games, with these niggas, man
(Somebody tell me what do I do...)
None at all, man... hit 'em off, none of that, man


Aiyo, jump out the Acura, crazy heavy, what's popping?
Us locking the game, word to every hand on the locman
Street gwop, everybody eats, sweep blocks
This is a message, ain't go no grams, we gon' beatbox
Study like lessons, niggas in the game biting the grain
You knowing where it came from, stop it
You thought we wasn't coming? You dumbing, you blunted again
Watch Lex get that dough out ya pocket, rhyme all 'pallegic
Can't nothing move when I rhyme, when I drop lines it's law out in Egypt
Love ups, don't need no batteries now, what?
The only niggas that'll glow'll be us
Yo, throw me in Sin City, leave me with the vultures and bats
Then give me two weeks to bubble like Kim titties
Dirt Dog, we miss you, now it's time to murder the game
Cuz if things change, you know it ain't against Wu


What am I supposed to say? Yeeaaah
Somebody tell me what do I do...


We keep it hot, keep the heat on the block
We never stop, drawing water up until it begin to drop
Raining with the patchwork of puzzles
That was written in the year of the dragon
More raw than you could ever imagine
How much of a great blessing to a rap city
Where the youth is organically fed, from the Witty
Unpredictable, Talent And Natural Game is lyrical
Analyze the picture, the portrait, the visual
A Cuban Link Chef cooks spaghetti that's untied
RAGU nigga whose tomatoes are sundried
He gave y'all niggas whiplash from bling bling
But my rhyme'll give ya hot flash and moodswings
Math shed light on divine secrets, then science leaked it
For the lower level creatures that can't peep it
I observe MC's, regardless
From a neighboring world which is ten times the sharpness...




Let the track wind and ya mind flow free
Remain conscious on this ride to ya best ability
Infinity, back to the source of which it came
Energy, see it change forms, atoms being born, never ending
On and on and on and, travel with me
Not trying to convince the pack, that it's a fact
For those who can't adapt, I lived it, shitted it back
We have agreed, you'll feel the impact of the truth when I'll squeeze
The brain feels something pop, hip hop, locked in texts
Fat checks, fly whips, jewelry, chicks
Enough kicks, fitted crown, buttoned down
Underneath the white T lies the four pound
This is forty-five minutes of menacing
Dismantling, any MC opponent stepping in the zone
Get ya face blown (Get ya face blown)




Observe the word, when I speak, get the truth's heard
True to the curb, Wu classic is the new birth
Spreading the blessing across seven continents
Arm of the trench, there's no form of defense
Entertainment, nine swords swing rapid
Check the techniques, first bow to The Abbott
Witty Unpredictable, gritty individual
Valid, if it's Actual, Talent and it's Natural
Game, rugged like the train, pump it in ya vein
I and I ride or die under the name
W-U, the primary, ya secondary
Definitely not necessary, the legendary
You printed the blueprints to do this shit
Moving the youth in the bricks
Spit poison tipped darts that rip hearts
Through the chest, when I manifest my sick art


Speaking my mind, fall in line when I spit mine
Still in my prime, still'll shine til it quit time
If this is a crime, find me guilty, I'm so sublime
So rapid with rhymes, sayin' I'm slacking is assonine
Revealing the truth, catching feelings, it's still the Wu
Gorilla the booth, body armored, them killa proof
In living proof, I'm the Wittiest Unpredictable
Most Talented rap muthafucker you ever listened to


I'm a hustler, I grind til my pack is done
Give a seed mad knowledge til they crack and run
Can't nobody fuck with me, I'm just too nice
Smack niggas in they head everytime I write
Yo, I'm straight from Park Hill where the guns is popping
Where them little black kids do they grocery shopping
Go to school fucked up, it's Africa Island
We poor in the bricks but inside it's nothing but talent




Yo Yo Yo doodododododo Yo pssh yo
Yo park the Jeep on the street of the Sunset Marquis
Autograph sign and pass wit a gold tip Sharpie
Permanent ink blots, I'm drunk on Red Label scotch
All you faggots try to judge my shit like Ed Koch
Underground left and right pair surround sound can't be scared
Plea the amps, video tape, steady cam
Golden chrome, desert eagle never left at home
Flip the track of the beat, watch Bobby flip the metronome
High voltage, keep my seed and wiz well-cultured
Peal enemies, my melon dim, the poison blue postage
I open and fold ya, Dirty fucked the ogre
I leave the cats the book of food stamps and that poga
The box of evil, a fifty sack of that lethal
Adjust these boots and bloody cube steaks from keebu


What party can you go to
And I ain't there you bitches actin like you don't care


You bitches actin like you dont care
You bitches actin like you YO
Razor blade toenails cut holes inside tube socks
Golden platinum things unstainable, I chew rocks
Cybertech digital suit deflect bullets
Black hooded surrounded by forty acres of wooded
Land, like my cousin dusty dirty ass Dan
Fucked the daughter of the leader of the Ku Klux Klan
Tapes we dub, pound you wit the ace of club
Poppin your tree to a shrub
Tongue kiss a lion then kidnap her cub
Passionate portrait, my biz spread eagle, wild orchid
Pussy so wet you could fuck it wit a soft tipped dick
Tickle the tonsil you could hear her coughin
I don't know if Dirt fucked Mariah, but I'm out to fuck Tyra
Starks might fuck Mya


I'm the pussy vampire
I don't wanna work no more
I want my own island

Chorus


Yo I'm bent out three days two nights yo I'm spent out
One hell of a cruise New York got they hand out
Like I owe somethin, check they stance they frontin
I'm two seconds from twistin y'all shit over nuttin
All a sudden ice grills kid you did a baby bid
In the mix, almost hung yourself, slit ya wrists
To the maximum, hand me the forty I'll thrash 'em
Split out, guess who gassed 'em, made Ghost throw his mask on
Trauma the block pro, bar sledge slang ho
Runnin from two-inch soles, some rap and I might blow
World Cup, some been blessed wit the Stanley
Ivan Lendl lend you autographed racket wit the hankey
Sideline manuever, polished wack MC remover
Niggas wit long nails cuttin me, leavin bruises
Cantelopes, tied a thousand on y'all folks
Came home, this dusthead dude tryin to play me close
Sweepin, peep fears, Liz wants to chop in this kid
I might do magic make him disappear
Rear-rose that nigga, Isotola Coca-Cola holder
Snap the granola, sprinkle ginko bola
Venom from a cobra, laced in the cummy ball odor
Soaked through a strainer, here's a dose of
The King James version, displayed just like Samsung
Wit effects that'll kill Rogers 007
Hanna Barbera, heart's the opposite of Bambi the deer
Fuck wit mics like Sonny and Cher
Or maybe the Captain & Tennille, immaculate golden seal
Nice like Mr. Whittendale your girl Chippendale
Shallah Price all up in ya dogged-out trench
When I snatched that, shit was broke shoulda sent ya ass back
And where's the key to the hatchback, pop that
Get in throw a bag full of mic's in there, respect that


What party can you go to, and Wu ain't there
These niggas actin like they don't care
What party can you go to, and Wu ain't there
These hoes actin like they don't care




It's on {Where your sparkle at kid?}
(RZArector)


Yes the shit is raw coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, "Wu-Tang's back for more"
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)


This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
X Y  slam Nine Diagram pole
Raekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback Notre Dame
Golden Arms is bronze Buddha palm hit Qu'ran
It blows extreme, mainstream be the theme, supreme team
America's Cream Team, redeemed
Vidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone
Gun POW to the dome and split the bone
Wig blown off the ledge by the alleged
Full-fledged, sledge RZA edge
One dose of my feroc' handheld trigger cuts
A capella spitting shell paralyse if you get touched
And critical mic cords, hanging like umbilical
Cords, dope swords, five star general
Raw be the quote rap style sore throat
Through the fully operational, handheld totem




A hundred thousand times one, snatch up my styles get done
I hold a title, and here's how my belt was won, check it
Slick majestic, broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew through lack of effort
You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes
My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
Masked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords
And his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines
With more gains than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains
Poisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this
You get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this
Side effects of hot raps and hot tracks
A duffel bag full of guns son, dipped in black
My culture, glides and attacks you like a vulture
Ghostface in Madison Square is on your poster




Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy show it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
Of the Wu and learnt how to
Fuck up your anatomy steadily, calm and deadly
Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit
MCs submit to the will as I kill your
Juvenile freestyle, civilize the mental
Devils worship this like an icon
Bear-hugging mics with the grips of a python




You heard other raps before but kept waiting
For the Son of Song, I keep dancehalls strong
Beats never worthy of my cause, I prolong
Extravaganza, time sits still
No propaganda, be wary of the skill
As I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum
Dedicated to rap nigga, beware of the fearsome
Lebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat
CD massacre, murder to cassette
I blow the shop up, you ain't seen nothing yet
One man ran, tryna get away from it
Put your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh
Into your chamber like Freddy enter dream
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause, like a black jack to dat
You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertaining motherfuckers can't stop O
In battling, you don't want me to start tattling
All up on the stage cause y'all snakes keep rattling
Bitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you wanna clock me like Sherry
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry
Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in, and get ten dollars back
The fat LP with Cappachino on the wax
Pass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LPs back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt and dial 9-1-7
1-6-0-4-9-3-11
And you could get long dick hip-hop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction
I'm Staten Island best son, fuck what you heard
Niggas still talking that shit is absurd
My repertoire, is U.S.S.R
P.L.O. style got thrown out the car
And ran over by the Method Man Jeep
Divine can't define my style is so deep
Like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy
Like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind
Cause you weak in the knees like SWV
Tryna get a title like Wu Killa Bee
Kid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbott
Me and RZA rhyme name printed in the tablet
Under vets, we paid our debts for mad years
Hibernate the sound and now we out like bears
In Born Power, born physically, power speaking
The truth in the song be the pro-black teaching



(*Prod. by The Revelations, Bob Perry, and Noah Rubin)


Christians say that you can study all day
Pray all day, and chant all day
But you get to heaven faster
If you hang with the wise men
Yeah I would say once you got inspired spark
Y'know, you strive, to, y'know
You gotta put, y'know you gotta keep puttin wood on it as they say
Right? Keep it burnin or whatever
You gotta find a way to keep it burnin
But then there's the optimum side of it
That's the burnin fire that's burnin but it don't burn
Knahmean? Just in life, like the sun
You know the sun is seen, like that
But it's like a eternal sun that
That it is on regardless, you just on
You just free from, y'know
Shit don't work on you no more
The story of the villain




The fox, is kinda foxy, Mr. Wolf he's the guy
Who chased Red through the woods and ate Grandma
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
Unlike the wolf, who made a widower of Grandpa


Yo, must I flex my cash, to sex yo' ass
I wet the Ave. when I set my path
The 'Vette don't crash, I'm built to long last
Grab my money clip, I hit the bong fast
Earn my respect, my checks they better cash
Finger on the trigger with my nigga Fred Glass
Knuckles is brass, start snuffin you fast
Jumpin outta cabs, grabbin money bags
Next shot go right through your hovercraft
You do the math my acid tongue slash
When will you learn it's return of Shaft
The genuine thriller, the Miller Draft
My force might blur, the Porsche'll purr
The apple martini, of course it's stirred
I'll do the honor,  the Shaolin bomber
Shark skin armor, I'll bring the drama




Damn, defecatin' on the map
Wu-Tang takin it back, no fakin in the rap
How real is that, cause niggas hatin on the fact
That the kid is blazin this track and hatin on 'em back
My dough's stacked up with O's, who the mack
Duckin po'-po's blowin smoke O's in the 'Llac
To be exact, don't want no hassle with the stack
In the Big Apple, we the rotten apples in the back
Yeah, it's all grillin, how the fuck y'all feelin?
Non-stop park killin, on the block we was killin 'em
The arch villans, when the blood start spillin
Any stuck start squealin, body bags we was fillin 'em
Yeah, now I got it in the smash
Ounce of marijuana and a llama in the dash
Me and my comrades followin the cash
And livin e'ry day like tomorrow is the last




I'm like the St. Bernard to ya baby when you're lost out in the snow
Like a coyote out on the desert...
Where the foxes never go
And the wolf, they never go...


Yo, would you recognize a jewel for what it is when you see it
Or would you take it for somethin else and get to' the fuck up
Men come together for the common cause
To beat yo' ass, just because
There's a line you don't cross offendin the boss
While of course his one selectin through your head shot
I'm back in the yard again, the bars callin
15 sets of this will have you swollen
Ladies like, "Damn papa you lookin right
I'd love to give you some of this pussy and I'm a dyke"
I write when the energy's right to spark friction
DJ cuttin it, spinnin it back mixin
Great pop knock tickin, poetry description
For the motion picture reenactment
Activate a hired assassin, keep it classic
Rap evolution every black, yo pass that








And in our line of work we need all the help we can get
Tony Wings the name. He works for a drug ring in Central America
Who wants to kill him? No information, say yes or no
1.5 million
All right, you get what you want, moneys no object. Theyre all clean
No serial numbers. Untraceable. And there explosive head bullets, your favorite
I felt someone walk over my grave. You want to change your mind?

 Yo son criminal is blowin the fuck up

 Universal frontier
 Original bloodclat bad boys
 Check it out boy


Who come to get you, none, they want guns
I be the first to set off shit, last to run
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother Son cause he shine like one


Scriptures hit the body like sawed-off shotties
Like my hair knotty and my nosepiece snotty
Fuck a nigga hottie, that ho pussy probably
Burn like the deserts of Mogabi, for real
Ain't nothing fraudulent here, we pioneer
Commandeer a new frontier, this be the Wu yeah
36 Chambers of fear, huh you lost it
Information leaking out your faucets, hmm
Time to forfeit your crown and leave the grounds
There's a new sheriff in town holding it down
It's the two holster, shit shot smoker
Wanted dead or alive, bounty on the poster
Wild in the West, a student of my culture
And life is the test, hold up
Let a nigga catch his breath
I'm still paying dues and the last one is death
Back to the essence with that shit you stressing, this rap profession
Now peep Tical, the son of the Shaolin Isle
Bless my style, criminology pays
The last times and days, Johnny fucking Blaze


This goes for niggas who know
Wu will blow like yayo, lay low
Plus cooling in Barbados
Ricans be giving me much shit to touch shit
Stay cool Papa, see you with enough shit
Back at the lab a, crack's bagged up
Yo niggas act up, what blow up their workers if they have to
Seoritas, fucking up a storm buying Gods margaritas
Sucking his dick, up in the whip long
Designed for rhyme crime nigga jail time jiggas
Them niggas up in hype Vigors lighting niggas
Silks Wally wear Figaro chain yeah
Jakes beware of black rap millionaires
Rock Airs, leather goose, bears blowing this year
1-800-GAMBINO niggas, yeah


Wu roll together as one, I call my brother Sun cause he shine like one


Solid gold crown is shining, we're blinding like some diamonds
I'm reclining in the sky on a cloud with silver lining
Double breasted, bullet proof vested, well protected
The heart, the rib cage, the chest and solar plexus
Casting stones, cracking two-hundred and six bones
And watch your ass get blown to a sea of fire and brimstone
How dare you approach it with them poems
The overfiend like noah bean green souls with a soldier mean
The grand exquisite imperial wizard or is it
The Rzarector come to pay your ass a visit
Local bio-chemical, universal giant, the black general
Licking shots at Davy Crockett on the bicentennial
Happy Millennium two thousand
Microchips, two shots of penicillin goes up your Adrenalin
Son it's time for bouting
It's a model you're resembling the niggas who like following
Trapped inside your projects like a genie inside the bottle and


God stepping forth upon holy ground of the track
It's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like I'm under attack
So I decided to bite down on the mic
So the pain of the track won't deny the fact that I'm the master
For what lurks, is an expert that hurts
The individual who tries to visualize under
Cause I strike, like thunder
Niggas couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable
My wisdom fucks up your respiratorial
Systems are fractured by the killer tactics
Style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged
Enter the entity, my vicinity
Is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity
Represent the school of hard knocks and Glocks my
Clan is hostile and got mad moss for blocks so
Feel the force of impact from the iron side of
The gat as I attack the track
From the blind side of the pack, Starks pass the chrome
Watch a nigga get blown out his motherfucking dome-piece
Deceased, laid to rest


Who come to get you, none, they want guns
I be the first to set off shit, last to run
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother Son cause he shine like one


Yo, aiyyo I got this under my wing, move give me room
Holding up your saloon, clean sweep, like a broom
Full moons make me howl like a wolf out of breath
Sold only new vocal cords you heard Genius on Gef
So step back, to the lab at, high velocity
My team make hand-to-hand sales, we're like a pharmacy
Fuck Geraldo, Pablo's plan bro is Bravo
Goodfellas we know, best sellers become novels
The man rocking head bands, silk scarves and jams
Early 80's British Walkers, playboys, mocks and shams
The laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies
Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's
Remember them kids that came off with eight million
Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavilions
Them flour heads must have been stupid
Tell me how the fuck black niggas get caught with all that loot kid
There's jet money, underground money
Submarines and rings too bad you fucked up dummies




These things just took over me
Just took over my whole body
So I can't even see no more
I'm calling my Black woman a bitch
I'm calling my peoples all kinds of thing that they not
I'm lost brother, can you help me
Can you help me brother, please


You see what we did, we lost the love
I'm talking bout the love, the love of your own


But brother, but brother, but brother, check this out
I still don't understand man, I'm all high off this shit man


Well, what I'm trying to say my brother
Why, why do we kill each other
Look at our children, what kind of a future


This is the training that's gonna be given to you by the Wu
Brothers and sisters

The revolution, the revolution will be televised, televised, televised

It's time to rise, and take our place so we can inherit the universe
The planet Earth belongs to God

This is nineteen-ninety-seven

Every square inch of it that he chose for himself, is the best part
Behind every strong woman you'll find a strong man
And behind every strong man you'll find a strong woman
The universe is not completed without the sun, moon and stars
(Want to be free)
That's man, woman and child
To all you fake-ass niggas who think you gonna survive out here
Without your Black woman, you're wrong
They have attraction powers on the planet
We are original man, the Asiatic Black man
The maker, the author, the cream of the planet Earth
Father of civilization and daughter of the universe
The population was seventeen million, with the two million Indians
Making a total of nineteen million, four billion, four hundred million
All over the planet earth
(Mandela, Mandela)
Arise you Gods, it's the time for the revolutional war
(Malcolm X, Malcolm X)
That's the mental war
That's the battle between God and devil
Take the devil off your plane
Take him off your mental mentality, take him off your brain
Leave all the cigarettes and guns, the alcohol and everything
Thats the mental devil that exists within your body
That's destroying and decaying your mind
The mind controls the body
Everything within must come out
Don't look towards the sky cause there's no heaven above
Don't look down beneath your feet, there's no hell below
But heaven and hell exist within
Heaven is what you make it and hell is what you go through


There is only one God
There is a whole new one, faith
There is a only one
One revolution yeah


At one time it was told to me
That man came from monkeys
That we were swinging from trees
I hardly can believe that unless I'm dumb, deaf and blind
You ever heard about, the ape man and the ape woman
You have a mankind, that has a beginning to him
And his ending, is about to come


If you take one step, I will take one with you
Through the storm and pain, swim the deepest sea, with you my brother
I know you got to be strong, gotta hold on


Now the story is about to close
It was a hundred percent of us
That came on the slave ships
Eighty five percent of our people was uncivilized
Poison animal eaters
They're slaves of the mental powers
They don't know who the true and living God is
And their origins in the world
So they worship what they know not
And they're easily lead in the wrong direction
Ought to be lead in the right
And now you got the ten percent who are rich slave makers of the poor
Who teach the poor lies that make the people believe
That the all mighty true and living God is a spook in the sky
And you can't see him with the physical eyes
They're also known as blood suckers of the poor
And then you got the five percent
Who are the poor righteous teachers
Who do not believe in the teachings of the ten percent
Who is all wise and know who the true and living god is
And teach that the true and living god is a supreme being black man from Asia
Otherwise known as civilized people
Also Muslims, and Muslim's sons
Peace we out


I have given it much thought
It seems, disaster must come
At best, only postponed
Shaolin Kung-Fu
To survive must now be taught, to more young men
We must expand, get more pupils
So that the knowledge will spread

Hey, yo, RZA! Hit me with that shit one time!
And pull a foul, niggas, save the beef for the cow
I'm milkin' this ho, this is my show, Tical
The fuck you wanna do for this mic piece, duke?
I'm like a sniper, hyper off the ginseng root
PLO Style, buddha monks with the owls
Now who's the fuckin' man? Meth-Tical


On the chessbox
"Wu-Tang style"


I leave the mic in body bags, my rap style has
The force to leave you lost like the tribe of Shabazz
Murderous material made by a madman
It's the mic wrecker, Inspectah, bad man
From the bad lands of the killer
Rap fanatic representin' with the skill that's iller
Dare to compare, get pierced just like your ear
The Shooby Doo-Wop pop, strictly hardware
Armed and geared, 'cause I just broke out the prison
Charged by the system for murderin' the rhythm
Now lo and behold another deadly episode
Bound to catch another fuckin' charge when I explode


Slammin' a hype-ass verse 'til your head burst
I ramshack dead in the track, and that's that
Rap assassin, fast and quick to blast and hardrock
I ran up in spots like Fort Knox
I'm hot, top notch, Ghost thinks with logic
Flashbacks how I attacked your whole project
I'm raw, I'm rugged and raw, I repeat
If I die, my seed'll be ill like me
Approachin' me, yo, out of respect, chops to neck
I get vexed, like crashin' up a phat-ass Lex
So, clear the way! Make way! Yo, open the cage!
Peace, I'm out, jettin' like a runaway slave


You gettin' stripped from your garments, boy, run your jewels
All the meth got me open like fallopian tubes
I bring death to a snake when he least expect
Ain't a damn thing changed, boy, Protect Ya Neck
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah jam is fatal
Quick to stick my Wu-Tang sword right through your navel
Suspenseful force bein' brought through my utensil
The pencil, I bring strong winds up against you
Havoc, then run up through your county like the Maverick
Caps through the tablets, I gots to make the fabrics


A-a-a-ah-ah, are you a warrior killer slicin' shit like a samurai?
The Ol' Dirty Bastard from the bar
Ol' Dirty clan of terrorists
Comin' at your ass like a sorceress, shootin' that piss
Niggas be gettin' on my fuckin' nerves
Rhymes they be kickin'
Make me wanna kick their fuckin' ass to the curb
Boy got funky fresh like the Old Specialist
A carrier, messenger, bury ya
This experience is for the whole experience
Let it be applied, Unique drop that science


M-M-My clan is thick like plaster, bust ya, slash ya
Slit a nigga back like a Dutch Master
Killer, style jumped off in Killa Hilla
I was the thriller in the Ali-Frazier Manila
I came down with phat tracks that combine and interlock
Like gettin' smashed by a cinder block
Pow! Now it's all over; niggas seein' pink hearts
Yellow moons, orange stars, and green clovers




Niggas on the left, brag shit to death
Now hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, c'mon and attract to what
Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, brag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, c'mon and attract to what
This goes back to nineteen..
Ahem, check it, yo

Yeah, good morning to all you motherfuckin notty-headed niggas
Word to the camoflouge large niggas

Champion gear that I rock, you get your boots knocked
Then attack you like a pit that lock shit DOWN

But giving you more and more, like ding!
Nah shorty, get you open like six packs
Killer Bees attack, flippin what, murder one, phat tracks
A'ight? I kick it like a Night Flite!
Word life, I get that ass raw, I'm fulla spite!
Check the method from Bedrock, cause I rock ya head to bed
Just like rockin what? Twin Glocks!
Shake the ground while my beats just break you down
Raw sound, we going to war right now
So, yo, bombin
We Usually Take All Niggas Garments
Save ya breath before I vomit


I be that insane nigga from the psycho ward
I'm on the trigger, plus I got the Wu-Tang sword
So how you figure that you can even fuck with mine?
Hey, yo, RZA! Hit me with that shit one time!
And pull a foul, niggas save the beef on the cow
I'm milkin this ho, this is MY show, tical

Tiger Style! (Tiger style!)


Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit


Yo, there's no place to hide as I step inside the room
Dr. Doom, prepare for the boom
Bam! Aw, man! I slam, jam, now scream like Tarzan
I be tossin' and flossin', my style is awesome
I'm causin' more family feud than Richard Dawson
And the survey said you're dead
Fatal Flying Guillotine chops off your fuckin' head
MZA, who was that? Ayo, the Wu is back
Makin' niggas go Bo! Bo! like I'm Super Cat
Me fear no one, oh no, here come
The Wu-Tang shogun, killer to my eardrum


Put the needle to the groove, I gets rude
And I'm forced to fuck it up
My style carries like a pick-up truck
Cross the clear blue yonder, sea to shinin' sea
I slam tracks like quarterback sacks from L.T.
Now why try and test the Rebel INS?
Blessed since the birth, I earth-slam your best
'Cause I bake the cake, then take the cake
And eat it, too, with my crew while we head state to state


And if you want beef, then bring the ruckus!
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthing ta fuck wit
Straight from the motherfuckin' slums that's busted
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthing ta fuck wit


Hah! Lebonon, step up, boy!
Represent! Chop his head off, kid!


The Meth will come out tomorrow
Styles, conditions, bizarre, bizarro
Flow, with more afro than Rollo
Comin' to a fork in the road, which way to go? Just follow
Meth is the legend, niggas is sleepy hollow
In fact I'm a hard act to follow
I dealt for dolo, Bogart comin' on through
Niggas is like, "Oh my God, not you!"
Yes, I come to get a slice of the punk and the pie
Rather do than die, check my flavor
Comin' from the RZA, which is short for The Razor
Who make me reminisce true
Like dj vu, I'm rubber, niggas is like glue
Whatever you say rubs off me sticks to you


Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit
Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit


Ahh-hah! Yeah! Representin' Brooklyn, Queens
Long Island, Manhattan, Bronx
The Rugged Lands of Shaolin
Niggas from Virginia, Atlanta, our boys in Ohio
Comin' through with the crazy Y-O Y-O
Yo, niggas from The Source
My man Kelly Woo from the Gavin
Will Strickland, Jason Staton, yeah
True, true, my nigga Crown, what's goin' down, boy?
We ain't nuthing ta fuck wit
The whole Texas mob, the Chicago mob
Niggas from Detroit, fuckin' California squadron
Comin' through, you know what I'm sayin'?
The whole fuckin' West Coast to the whole East
Niggas from D.C., down in Maryland
All the way over there in Morgan State
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthing ta fuck wit
All over the whole fuckin' globe, comin' through, boy
Peace to the fuckin' Zulu Nation
Peace to all the Gods and the Earths, word is bond
Wu-Tang slang, choppin' heads, boy
It ain't safe no more, peace!



	Aiyyo, American Cream Team productions, bustin
	Harlem World, Shaolin
	We back.. and we ain't goin nowhere
Get that?  They gonna respect me
(Just just slay on em when you come back)


Yo, the effervesence of my team be cool, calm
Persuasive, deadly, posessive, manic depressive
In the golden art,  get torn apart
In the dark, sharks swim deeper than Noah's Ark
Harlem Hood, Wu breddern, stay rebellin
Better be, careful of the beef that you meddle in
Devilish advocates, death peddlin
Turnin' up the kettle-in', we be veterans


Say no more, Banky gonna lay down the law
Got Hoodz that's quick on the draw to sick em on y'all
Them broads that you sweatin, I don't stick em no more
We import dimes from Singapore, bang em on tour
Run out of Chandon, we gon order some more
You got, ones in your crib, then I'm outside your door


Twist a black Dutch up, whattup, crane style, chain style
Magnolium Rock, twenty-eight thou', plus
Gorgeous, Star Trek cordless
Finish the  we in it, need more fish in the fortress
Flashback freeze, chedder in the sweater three keys
Myer Lans' stance, Don Steez

Chorus: Raekwon

Yo, take time out, hold your nine out
Polly with the all time lineup, send mine to shine, what?
Cream Team lifestyle, aight now..
Fuck around get wiped out, mic fightin on the kite now
Despite thou, go against us, win it right now
Shed light, bring it to light, and move right


Another sound boy dyin, crowd noise multiplyin
Don't let the fuzz slide in, bust out the sirens
Sure win, lure em in like exotic women
I smile with the sinister grin to finish him
You  with Hoodz, get your goods pushed back
You fraud, pull the wool off your Hollywood act
Throw your body on the tracks, pull the back out your raps
Burn like, the human torch, lookin for collapse
It's the intricate, syndicate, thoughts travel infinite
Thunderous, movin hundreds, we on the run 


Who bring that Harlem World Willie  the best, we know
New Jack City 2, Banky B. Nino
600 Benz-ino, midnight blue
Put a dime in the front, I'm off to slide pipe through


Yo, it's us, the Cold Crush, ice  plush
Baby what, peep the black dust, diamond in the rough
Give a , I'm like iodine, see me in the cut?
Playin shadows, ridin on the track side-saddle
Long John Silver, the God on your block like God-zilla
*RRAWWARRR* She gave away my  I'mma kill her

Chorus: Raekwon

Aiyyo, spit for me, hear me, Cream Team
Wake these  up they ain't hear me, promotin on Leary
Yo come back, switch slang theory
American Cream with no I in the team, laser beam


Aiyyo I keep my  raggety, pants saggy, millionaire faculty
Backin me up, knee deep for casualties, speak brief
Thoughts like a street sweep, sporadically reach peaks
And spaz out, bitch smack your majesty
Iron palm drillin through your cavity, you want it Dunn how badly
Got eighty cats, creepin in your alley, where your dogz at?

Chorus: Raekwon

Yo, take time out, hold your nine out
Polly with the all time lineup, send mine to shine, what?
Cream Team lifestyle, aight now..
Fuck around get wiped out, mic fightin on the kite now
Despite thou, go against us, win it right now
Shed light, bring it to light, and move right

"America's Cream Team.."
"Ah-ah-America's Cream Team.."


Uh-huh, what what?
One time baby, big shout to the RZA
Big shout to my man Power
Big shout to Raekwon the Chef, Inspektah Deck

Volume Three, Funkmaster Flex aight the final chapter baby



 (GZA)
Yo, yo one two one two, yo live in effect
We got the king Ruler Zig-Zag-Zag Allah
Commonly known to y'all as the RZA
Yo before we go into side two or side B of this double CD
Knahmsayin I want to give y'all a little announcement man
For the last year there's been a lot of music comin out
The shit been weak, knowhatI'msayin?
A lot of niggas trying to take hip-hop
And make that shit R&B, rapping bullshit yaknowhatI'msayin?
Or make that shit funk
Fuck that, this is MCin right here, this is hip-hop
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang gonna bring it to you in the purest form
I got the GZA on my side, Killah Priest
Sunz of Man, Royal Fam, Killarmy, Gravediggaz, 12 O'Clock
Yo, we want to let y'all niggas know somethin man
To my people all across the world; Japan, Europe -- knowhatI'msayin?
Canada, knowmean -- Austria, Germany, Sweden
Yo, this is true hip-hop you listenin to right here
In the pure form, this ain't no R&B with a wack nigga takin the loop
Be loopin that shit thinkin it's gonna be the sound of the culture
YaknowhatI'msayin? (That player bullshit)
YaknowhatI'msayin? All that player dressin up
On this shit, actin like this some kind of fashion show man
YaknowhatI'msayin? This is hip-hop right here
YaknowhatI'msayin? This is lyrics, MCin
And yo, to y'all niggas who think you going to become an MC overnight
YaknowhatI'msayin? Better snap out that fuckin dream
Man it takes years for this you Cat in the Hat ass rappers
You Dr. Seuss, Mother Goose, simple minded
(Stop runnin up on niggas with all that wack shit)
Word up man (talking bout "you MC")
You ain't no MC; niggas ain't made for this yaknowhatI'msayin?
This shit was Only Built 4 Cuban Linx -- we told y'all niggas back then
And then everybody wanted to change their motherfuckin name
YaknowhatI'msayin? We come out with a style
Now everybody wanna imitate our style and all you producers out there
YaknowhatI'msayin? It's all good to show love to a nigga
But stop bitin my shit, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Come from your own heart with this shit
And all y'all MC's, stop biting from my niggas
We told ya'll niggas on the fucking Cuban Linx album
Don't bite our shit, y'all niggas keep biting
Yo, I'm going to tell y'all something man
It's time for the Wu revolution right here
To all my niggas across the world
Raise your motherfucking fist in the air
And get ready for the Triumph
Cause the Gods is here to take over this shit
Word up, peace








You would do anything to get all of the Wu-Tang sword styles!
The Wu-Tang sword style (2X)


Yo, enter the dragon, the kid I'm for baggin
Whip them now it's time to start raggin
Victim's two for this if they got the proper
Step up please to play the Ra, shut
Head first that's the wrong blow to throw
Jump fit now step what you dead
You arouse the anger, the Wu-Tang slanga
That diga-diga-danger
Just go on the issue and make me wanna get a tissue
Dismiss you, put it to your head and dismiss you
For your weak rhyme proposal, I just froze you
Cuz you chose to play me for a softy
I freeze so many MC's they ought to call me frosty
Not sho man, no man is a slow man
I be makin dough like the Pillsbury dough man
And burnin MC's is all natural
Be like cabby and go up and laugh at you
And while he laughin I be bombin
Calmin, alarmin sound that be bombin
MC's like a group of Killa Beez
No one in the world make rhymin trilogies
Slick majestic but you can past the
Prince Rakeem is the Wu-Tang Master




Kick to the tragic, rabic, tactic of rappin
You bastard and prepare your casket
Death is the finally step when y'all step
To intercept the rep of the brother who has kept
His status, stop the madness, that is
I'm not the gladest, the baddest
The phattest but Rakeem is the cleanest
But Rakeem is the CREAM when it comes to my team
Know what I mean?
Past imperial, bust my itereria
I blow from Bolivia to Nigeria
Just to know that black, y'all could know that
Me bein wack is like naps on Kojack
Non-existent, ya keep ya distance
You wanna battle? Bring assistance
Proxy, moxy, groups of troupers
Pullin super duper, wanna step to ya
Pass the stereo, king with the venerial
Here's the imperial I fucked up my stereo
You pop your Glocks and watch the Fort Knox
Why not? I got flavor like Dr. Butterscotch
You can't hang with the slang I register
Now you wanna make a replica but you could never past the
Prince Rakeem, the Wu-Tang Master






Cappadonna up in here maintainin'
Big Prince know what I'm sayin'
Ghostface Killah, Raekwon the Chef, Jon ya know


It's like fifty Stapleton, Don fifty Park Hill
All of y'all other crab niggas better chill
What, Stapleton, Park Hill organization
Death threat, we cover square inches of the nation
Avoid confrontation by all means necessary
Gold chains and gold teeth is definitely mandatory
When you come through Tony Touch territory
The burial ground sounds become a whole different story
Acapell jobs are fat jobs
New Cappadonna have props for years
On the intercom, my outcome, no they couldn't get none
Cause I wreck mics for fun
Casually flowin' smack me if I'm not knowin'
Give em' a chance to understand what they hearin'
Lick shots ya better maintain ya military bearin'
Cause in 97 Illuminati carry Glocks
But I can't afford to forfeit cause I was born to rock they knots
Danger if you ever want more anger
Bring ya whole drive by family into my chamber
Don is more maculate, Rae is more maculate
Ghost is more maculate, Prince came to tackel it
Who holdin' me down, 96 representin' for 97
All night grove right here






Word up Wu-Tang
We gon' do this for y'all up in here real quick
Word up, that's my word know what I mean
Got my man Muggs in effect, right by my side know what I'm sayin'
That's my people right there
Word up, word up Big Prince yeah
Yeah dog bless that right there


From the lost and found villages, the rap Jesus Christ
Pender, ponder record might nail inside my right
It's who eye the vessel, chosen the rap slogan
Walk about the throne, royal black to be voguin'
The outcome forever when words are put together
Duck deep inside ya mind like Ludonna did to treasure
The map of Staten Island X marks the park hill
Bone you with skill, Donna business before pleasure
Niggas out for Donna then they wig gotta be measured
For guillotine and routine ya heard and never seen
Bloody mass murder situation unclean
Blindfold the rhythm, duck tape around the microphone
Weights are gettin' pushed back, heads are gettin' flown
Screams and yells, niggas is thristy for acapells
I meditate, coordination sparkle like a jewel
When I show articulation
The format of rap status, man show articulation
Down before the street and I ain't got no invitation
To a Wu-Tang concert, Killa Bee cookout
All pages due when I take my rap book out
I'm representin' for all my Gambino niggas, uh-huh


Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo detinate that
Detinate that pussy Massengill rap, cleanse that
The kids knife snatch collars off
Wile ridin' off
Float boat, big boys, Oakland A's stashed away blades
Venilation left the sharks animes
Something sheist like seven butcher knives
Rollin' rover style twice
Finger itchy like lice
Hair fell out, something to conquer
Stomp ya like that cat Blanka
Toy Tonka truck, ten carat on ya monster
Bring Rocky like fu-shick, motorize (Ahhh)


Yo check it, check it, check it
Yo, yo, yo, yo, hey yo
We swindle, make moves
Peep gentle out the window
Flamingo, Santo Domingo, Lex Lingo
Bruce Wayne thinkin' graveyard rocks are swingin'
Multi-million, rap pavillion stay G'ing
All night, Mary Jane ventures, Bud Light
Cold production rights, spoke to Christ
Use Woolite
Statue heads all up in my lab like mag
Empty bags, a line in the yard well fed
Dead weight yo
Cable the clamp around the neck
Sucrets, fast corvettes, techs I'm a vet
Sabotage, rap motor large, Mickey caught a charge
Credit card scam, when he cry rock the Wu scarf
Televise the shit on Fox
Big Ghost'll grab the shit unfasten ya box
You're allergic to the fungus on Earth
Killa Bee headquarters is worth
Kadafi body in this turf yo
Shame on all y'all brothers on some Baywatch
Soundin' like me, suckin' my ss
Pretty tone, nicknamed the great Tony Atlas
Don't wanna come at this






My seeds grow and his seeds marry his seeds
My seeds grow and his seeds marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang forever, baby


It's good to see the Wu-Tang family under one roof
We celebrate, toastin' shots, Ciroc 40 proof
Burgers on the grill and fried fish
The wiz made potato salad, greens for a side dish
Cold water, mill and reminisce with cousins and sisters
Children on the grass playin' ball and Twister
Fresh lemonade is made, we playin' spades
My nephews turn the livin' room into an arcade
Aunt's cherry baked pie, surprise, Johnny showed up
You can tell from the smell in the air, somethin' rolled up
It's love, peace and happiness, with the joy and laughter
Camera phones flashes, the moment is captured


It's so nice to see all the folks you love together
Sittin' and talkin' 'bout all the things that's been goin' down


It's goin' down
We rock all in together now, Wu-Tang forever now
Twenty years later we still bang whatever now
Turn change to cheddar
If I could take a quote from Obama, change is better
I vow to never let you down
Remember Meth Tical?
In my circle haters was never 'round
I'm a boss, owe that to Kevin Lile
Reunited, the whole world excited
Wu-Tang is for the kids and people and girls invited


Family reunion
Got to have a family reunion
Family reunion
It's so nice to come together
To get together
I wish grandma could see
The whole family
I sure miss her face
And her warm and tender embrace


I miss my grandmother, my auntie and Unique Ason
I knew Dirt was high when he had that face on
Fangs hangin' out his mouth, his fronts was golden
Wildin', record execs can't control him
He said ish like me and Mariah
Hit me, woah-woah-woah, that's fire
Still no matter what we gon' rep the name
Look at your family, we got twenty years in the game


A family reunion
Gonna have a family reunion ooh, ooh
Family reunion
It's so nice to come together
To get together


Aye yo
I'd like to make a toast to my Wu-Tang family
All over the globe
East coast, west coast
All my brothas in the hood keepin' it good
Peace to the Gods and Earths
All my Latino brothers
My Asian brothers, my Caucasian brothers
Wu-Tang Forever



Intro: Method Man

Ain't what you want baby
It's what you need baby
Ain't what you want baby
It's what you neeeeeeeed

Verse One: RZA

Yo diamond crystal rings sharp like icicles
Nickel plated pistols, official Wu-Wear covers my physical
Insulated thermal Wallabees drain they co four butt solos
Photographic prototype static-free motivated soldier
Or Wu say boulder head flower
You can detect the true and living God from his aura
Keep your sword straight, maintain your weight
But he ate too much monosodiumglutumate, and polysorbate
And drunk grape concentrate, with sodium benzoate
Fried the chicken thighs in triglycerides
And his bitch advertised her breast size
Eighty-five didn't realize, til the truth opened up his eyes
Then he became highly civilized
And spent time amongst the wise, went through a garment renaissance
And stopped wearing Benetton
Tommy Hill, Perry Ellis, Nautica, or Liz Claiborne
Ocean Pacific, Fila, Bill Blass and leave fitted
Quit the Armani sweaters with the Gucci wool knitted
Now all he buys, Kani's, Cross Colours, Shabazz Brothers
Mecca, Pelly Pell, 88, North Q, Bear and a few others
For the new year, strictly Wu-Wear

Chorus: Method Man

Ain't what you want baby
It's what you need baby
Ain't what you waaaaaant

Verse Two: Cappadonna

Pelle Pelle had the top dresser
One man catalog the London Fog casual hog
Bear denim with the Cash Wu Nike and Kangol king
Everyday, DLO jacket equipped with the drawstring
Fila supply big daddy Starter hat, The brown-skin derby match the Tommy Hill; Advil
Double button Woolridge, red dickie turtleneck
Mockneck, eighteen carat holdin my twenty-two shine
In this like Macy's or Bloomingdale's
The Century 21 son, the new portfolio dunn
Now it's my time, Asian Wu-Wear, Cappa fleece wear
One wear plaza, Donna hold the best of all year
Plus blue wear, Wu-Wear, what's going on
We're the best of this year, Wu-Wear and fleece wear

Verse Three: Method Man

Ain't what you want baby
It's what you need baby
Just come see me
Satisfaction guaranteed baby
Just hold your own baby
And just rock on baby
I got this wine on my mind
Feelin fine darlin
Now all you see baby
Ain't what you need baby
I wanna know just how low
It goes
Official nasty asses, straight shots in dirty glasses
Wu-Wear fleece for you and your stinkin piece
Hard time and killer tactics

Repeat 2x




Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

Oh, that's Meth Man, southpaw, I throw my left hand
To that hardcore shit that even make the Tec jam
Oh my goodness! Trust me, ain't nuttin' like some hood shit
Gotta love my dogs but ain't nuttin' like a good bitch
Strictly, if I'm goin' down, she comin' wit me
Whole time screamin', "Oh my God!", ain't no mystery


Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, you either step or get stepped upon
Correct me if I'm wrong but fake thugs never last long
Can't wait until ya fake ass gone
Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, you either step or get stepped upon
Nigga, uh-oh! I think they're playin' our song
Lit blunts, Clan in the front, sayin' "It's on!"


Try to Wu hate, duck, you could suck my
Watch the block get clear when I buck my
Boomerang darts, you can't duck my
No tellin' which Clan man you got struck by
Chains get tucked when he walk by, hawk eye
Arrows bein' fired from crossbow, I talk fly
You can't Etcha-sketch all my rhyme threat
Try to bite my flow, you catch ya throat strep
Soaked in cess, dope, you eat the cold Tec's
Bold flex, W crown, the ice O-X
Up in the oolie, yo, who you know?
John Bizzi, Ghost Deini, Rollie Finger and them toolies yo
Stainless Bobby, boy, you have an English folly
To try to detain the slang that we can to polly
Plus you didn't peep Irief, kid, you sleep
I seen this heap of shit, you in steep




Yo, amist the gravel, play the words of the Big Apple
Broadcastin' live from the pits of the battle
Wigs split and rattled, get shook out ya saddle
You ever hear me losin', one of y'all fix the panel
Ask who? Wu, that's true, known piranhas
Who knows drama, fathers of your whole persona
The mad doctor, stay locked in the O-R
In too deep, beyond reach of the sonar
Still a vet, say my name next to hall of fame
Hurtin' third string players, first day in the game
It's on, son, the Killa Bee swarm come
Make the world shake with one continuous drum




Wave ya gun, Killa (I got you)
Shoot this nigga in his face fast, mumblin' (I heard y'all forgot Wu)
Wear ya crown, black down (Watch the block too)
Blow at y'all niggas (Blowin' at the cops too)
Eh-yo, my wallets stay bulletproofs, racin' in Coups, yea we the realest
Ultraviolet leathers on, pealin' this, love lookin' the illest
Gorilla things, monster background with a history
You're pumpin' crack, yap clowns, we all real in here
Strap a bomb on a family member, let y'all niggas know we here
Blasted, it's like cheeba when I splashed it
Real reefer heads'll know the meanin' of hittin' glass
I told y'alls, against y'all, Ginsengs, avenge Gods
Picture me stabbin' you in the yard for R's
Kid saw Staten, nine Bin Ladens
Valors on, colorful draws, lookin' all relaxed in


Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, You either step or get stepped upon
Correct me if I'm wrong but fake thugs never last long
Can't wait until ya fake ass gone
Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, You either step or get stepped upon
Nigga, uh-oh! I think they're playin' our song
Lit blunts, Clan in the front, sayin' "It's on!"
