Yo, yo, Iron Chef, gracias
I need some of that, slide through the back
I need ya'll to come back to the, I heard juice
Back of the store over here, just be easy and tell ya man to be cool
We got some culinary cats right here, we need you we'll kill him if he fault


Aiyo, rappers steppin' to me, they want a brick son
But I'm the Chef, my price is twenty-six son
Move up, about thirty-two of those and open locker dough
Soldier got locked up, blow killed the doctor
Flamboyant police is X fives, watchin' my lofts
So many leeches I just left it and walked
My flow wicked, Miami money, movin' and ridicule
Geico on the arm froze, rose gold with me
Take baths with white women, lingerie see-through
Takin' trips to Iran, my Spanish nigga peoples
Sellin' drugs to Flatbush, call my nigga Cecil
Snub with the black gloves, on half-moon Greek do
Killed him in the Bahamas, his wife ran white van pulled up
They caught him out in Brooklyn with a white man
Slutted out, rosed out, sister was gone, she geekin'
She threw the rifle in her mouth and said good evenin'
Yup, Paul Wall grill line, be getting money, crime thief
I know her from Africa, pretty smile, nine teeth
Gold joints, frames only, Louis Vuitton, pony
Leather with the matching sweater on, you owe me


Knock the ash off the blunt, confront niggas who cunt
Swing an ax, tax niggas rhyme different from cats
Specialize in mic rippers, splashes
We the last skippers, big rocks and the block will stick


Beefsteak Charlie niggas eat and they get fat
Chase heads up and down the block and kill rats
Skilled with the gats, even feds don't know where the shells at
The shell trapped up in nice crib with four packs
Four macs, caught a nice sale for four stacks
Yeah, me and my nigga Arafat
Gotta escape but we'll be right back, real soon
Chef cook it up, we got a date with real goons
Telling you Ghost, my connect crazy with the wet
Might know him used to talk to his sister named Yvette
I speed it up, me and the Linx, was getting weeded up
I beat it up, yeah I hit that, but I ain't seed it up
Meanwhile, back on the block, we seen two trucks
Then the windows rolled down, we see these two fucks
Soon as they jumped out, see these tools bust




Yeah, yo, I lit a boogah up, rocks is gone, so we baggin' up all shape
Binoculars, scanners, we all listen to jake
Ran out of baggies, my mouth is dry
Got them dirty joints that scatter, don't act surprised
Nah, nigga the currency rushes like popping a wheelie
Holding a pipe with one hand, the other countin' the billies
You know how it be with the peppermint Clarks, throwing darts at a hoodrat
Getting slow neck up in The Bronx
That's all me, thirty four shines, forty four lines
I just chill like Aaron Hall, writin' raw rhymes
Like, threw Kool-Aid rubies in a lemonade bezzle
When I was twelve in the church, I started packin' that metal
A deuce-deuce, my supplier was Loose Bruce
Ever since I had the drop, my instinct was to shoot-shoot
This ain't For the Love of Ray J, it's for the love of the AK
Cuz you can get scratched like AJ
Cuban Link Dynasty has emerged, this rap shit stop
I have a team of niggas moving my furs






This one right here
1 & 9


Hate to see my brothers minds go dimes blow
Shines glow
No swine no pork
SI NY
Gainsborough
Every thought
Streets talk
Beats talk
East court
Knock your  off
Night cellular
Million dollar selling
I score cheddar up
Hard work betta us

Homies you cheap acts
Nigga Im G cats cars, money, microphones
Hundreds I keep that
Holding my fort down
My fort sports that east pack
Allow meats
Nigga we eat that
Study work hard make it out
Then we reach back
Monumental love
Continental wishes
Making death wishes
Hood niggas roll out
Dimes and ghetto bitches
Drug money riches
That had good niggas be snitches
Now wait a minute
My gun 
It could never be finished
I been in it since the beginning
X amount of free pussy
Free weed, free bombs, free business
For all the hell we been through
Nigga this is for the sinners
Its my word
Me and Shaeine an dem
Everybody do what they do
Lets take money, take paper man
Shine on, shine on
It dont even matter yo
We up the ladder on the reservation man
This is how we do
Shine talk, new talk, new walk
What you goin do nigga
This is how we off the boardwalk
All of ma niggas that getting that paper
Keep getting that paper


Hold up, hold up
I got something to say
Something to spray
Games on if you get in my way
Black gloves in the back
With the 9 in the tray
Pow
Lay you down
All you hear is the sound
See the guard, see the tassle
Yeah Im sporting a crown
Look around at my cypher
Get torched around
Unique
Im one different from the rest
Spitting with the tech
Blood leaking from your chest (lets go)
Surely aint one to test
I rest
You at peace
Leave a crease in the beat
Sumin for the street
Knowledge on
You know the theme of this song
Real minds
I talk mines
Thats how we all stand strong


You put in the couch
I got better plans
But I gotta watch my back
For black vans and pelligrins
Rap fans instead of 
Half chance to get it ram
Past friends
And the white chicks
Still saving the last dance
Two steps ahead of you
Ready for all the drama
Talk so heavy 
Of yo medical marijuana
Im shredding you in the biz
On some presidential shit
Crash surrender will show you the meaning
Of what reckless is
You cant do it all on your own
You got a betta chance
Ryna to pull a sword out of stone
You got a betta chance
Stocking goods to board up your home
Cause im callin it home
And blow up the mall with a drone
Of cause in the zone
Wildin like im violent in a foster home
Toss your bones in a bottomless pit
Or for them organ donors
Offer loan your heart is stone
Starting over in some parts unknown
That will rip you apart
Swim the sharks and get your cartilage torn


Im like a new baby guerilla
Thats born in the wild
Brains spillin on the 5th
Got you snorting on tile
Trained killer
Got a few in the coroners now
Easy to kill
And got me bent
When im recording my sound
Yeah, im from the borough of shaolin
Where the thoroughest niggas is found in
 niggas get pound in
Empty the clip
Throw another round in
Then jump in the black benz with surround sound in
My flows so deep niggas could drown in it
Adjacent to crystal lake
And sticking them clowns in it
Get stripped down in it
Exchange shots if you down with in
Between shots filled with browns 
Got the bank with the mounts in it
Five grand, this is my last roll
Then imma bounce, dig it
Platinum bridge in his mouth
With diamonds mount in it
Cause theres a lot of zeros in my accounts 
Filthy fuck boys hanging on  again
Cause I shoot bullets you cant block
Like adrian peterson
You dont wanna see shae on these streets again
Cause the sk sleep again
Gotta call in da and police again
I got too many guns for one person
Main street or back block
Catch it my guns bursting
You can catch me
Smack dab on the strip
Guns like calisthenics
Burn your abs with the fifths
So everytime you see me
The big mags on my hip
Fully loaded clips
For all you fags on my dick
And I shoot it sideways
Like bruce willis on his last flick
So move easy
And 9  are blasting
You wont last in the streets
And when it get cold
I turn it up
With the flash from the heat
Low bass settle deep
So go ahead and play with it
Turn your face into tomato sauce
When the tray hit it


Can you dig it 




I live life lavish and my chain is karats
The last name on the train to Paris
Used to be lame then attained the merit
So many clothes can't name the fabrics
Dynamics, I want the fame
And my name engraved in granites
Here's his lane, now came to grab it
You moving sideways, change your habits
Used to rock minks, then I changed to rabbit
From out the garbage, I came from average
Used to be righteous that changed to savage
Bang my ratchet like Bangkok Dangerous
36 Chamber fist Trianglist
Watch me mangle this Star Spanglist
Rock cowboy Wrangler creating mega-hits
I'm from the grain Game at my fingertips


Yeah! Killa Hill lay it down!
Killa Bees on the swarm!
Nigga


Ayyo I plow down ? like I'm out for revenge
Fuck it, it seems like the drama never ends
Be in the projects like I never left out
Might be on Osgood, see a nigga stretched out
I can't take it seems like my hood is cursed
Bad niggas, I thought that the good was first
My old whore, she march with a foul parade
Don't learn shit til another child is sprayed
I'm out here, fuck it, like I live on ? and Rico
Keep a low cut like Margie
I don't give a fuck, y'all made me bitter
I'ma whip your kids out like a babysitter
I'ma grown man but I'm young in the mind state
Live in every borough but New York my tri-state
Test me you know I brought a bitch on the tour bus
Pour piss on you, leave you stuck for 4 months
My head fucked up, I'm off my clean streak
Don't make me pick the 9's up, I come from mean streets
My unit snitched on me, ratted me out
They all ganged up on me, tried to take my mouth
However the cause I'm in jail and get bent
They cut from dirty cloth, I'm cut from cement
Original , got the crazy glow
Them devils tried to jump me, I'm crazy though
Absolut Vodka rat crush mad Goose
O.G. all day like I be on the deuce
Pop off with it, get your army in order
Staten Africa, Islam, across that water


Yeah
Told 'em "Have Gun--Will travel"
Blowing earth metals, black son spill gravel
Bronze Man oblong javelins in my cabinet
Detroit cement salutations from the missile plant
Quick to the hollowpoint, it ain't no olive branch
My low-cal 4 0 cal. in the cardigan
Tempted by Satan put a bullet in his diaphragm
Walk around black clouds and quiet violins
A tire fire blends poet and violent pens
Illest skill, got steel plots and iron winds
Uphill need a ghetto spill, the sirens sing
Street dreams. black season, inspired kings
For fire water veins, still rain Listerine
They chains through to my "Roots", no doubt Ben Verne
On the road to riches and diamond speech
I might turn a bag of white sand in mountain peaks


I don't text to send messages
My testosterone stimulate her estrogen
Whether Black, Caucasian or the Mexican
Asian, she get the message and she coming back for sex again
Organic drugs
My natural persuasion
You under the influence of 36 invasion
Spider-man amazing but I'm darker then Parker
Skin got abrasions from Arya and Tasha
Sliding down the street cold
Pull up to your party stimulated with a Jeep full
Of jerry gap honeys and bottles of vodka
Plus the weed rolls, here we go
Mediating, never jealous, over zealous
Wu Tang's my fellowship
Fans mash up accapellas of our lyrics with Beatle tracks embellishes
The idea clearly that Wu-Tang forever
This way of life is art, rhymes and cleverness
Joined by God no man can sever this
I complete jobs free and effortless
Use tiger crane, snake style plus the leopard fist




We will fight till the night is done
We will live our lives tonight as one
We will live our lives tonight as one, one


I'm a bad mother, shut your mouth
Insanity, DVD, how I stretch 'em out
What the stress about? INS best out
Fact, you knew that before he left the house
Fresh at the produce section
Gaze at my shine like a showroom necklace
Death wish, stepping in Deck's direction
I'm checking niggas like test questions


Across 110th now, cross Belmont and Montauk
Camera hawk hawks the sidewalk
When they get to flexing muscle niggas bust you
Hustlers do you, gave you your first toolie
Cutting out of school to pump your first loose leaf
Think graduate to wait, take it out of state, duct tape
Anything of pulse and heroin
Emcees frozen, cuban link chains are golden
I'm ownin' everywhere I'm holdin' it up, to keep it raw
Math here, I got 'em keep coming back for more


Yo, man, I'm so turned up, all the marijuana burned up
Y'all don't want the drama, word up
The Wu first up, the game is the world versus us
Y'all was good 'til the world heard us
Y'all ain't want them Clan birds up
Y'all don't want your man served up, that'll get the fans worked up
Homie really wanna play, stir it up
I'mma catch me a wave, surfs up
Gliding on the track like this, make me wanna act like this
Make me wanna smack that trick
Make a killer really wanna yap that kid
If he opens up his yap that's it




Mass of minerals in a glass house
Playing 4th the Wu neutrinos will blast out
Letting out verbal thunder bolts
Until the world attract old and younger folks
Charge with the vitality of magnetism
In large reality with massive rhythm
The manual without technical part
From the beginning give off an electrical spark


I respect you if you respect me
Everything's for real, WTC
No fake ass shit, don't front the Remy
Break bread, never have pockets empty
Let's get it, flip it up then we can spend it
The money train, Killa Beez on your brain
W's everywhere, one on your chain
Homeboys for life, please don't change
You can hide at my house, it ain't no thing
If you see the pigs, don't say jack
Call me original, don't say cap
I'm on the low, might be at the murder
Holding off the place y'all cats never heard of
Yeah, chicks wanna peep me out
Nasty ass, want me to pee in their mouth
But now I'm out, about to link with sticks




Bang a few notes up top, we call it beast mode
Forget the street codes, show you like a deep throat
It gets rougher, you suffer from the heat stroke
Blast barrels, embrace my leaf smoke
Park Hillians radio for back up
Polish your act up, nigga need a back up
Syrup in my cup, no cut, straight up
UG's on the court, never miss a lay up


When the emcees came to live out their names
Some rode the bus, some rode the train
Some motherfuckers wish they never came
When they met the nine swordsmen of Wu-Tang
Nine Maseratis pulls up to this party hard
Body, the party is filled with Godbody
There out of shape models coming through with those bottles
And double D's please, all eyes follow
Pass me a bucket of ice, that's nice
Hit with the vodka, what you say proper
I drink with the copper, show up in a chopper
Stop her, she wanna have a mnage  trois
I can tell by the bra, RZA Ra-KZA-Keem is all is Allah
Do you wish or wish upon a star? Do you wish or wish upon a star?






Yeah, start wit that one
Yo, yo, yo, my acustic futuristic lingustic rap fabric
Is a mixture of arabic sandscript in it's italics
I talk quick, y'all bitches can't comprehend my dick release spit
Wit love should I release hits
We travel through bodies like blood vessels
All y'all crab niggas try to wrestle to be on top of this pedastool
Slang doctrine, minoxin, lyrical toxin, I'm chessboxin
Words is rushin through like a herd of angry oxen!!


Fatal for these pussy cat niggas is dead weight
Concentrate, my murder rate excellerate, terminate
So spoil like coke in the foil
Knock knock, I shot the whole block
Electricity, flow splendidly
Internally inside of me like tony starks tee
I create excellency, one-sixty call l-o-u-n-g assist me
Papi wardrobe is key, roll promptly
For slang hall, vocabulary igor, frankenstein mind
Rewind for a minute while I dig down your track, stupid
I move quick shit is accurate, kojack tactics
Chaos, killa bee minds, high society blackness, spread the rumor


My lyrical marv-el makin more cream than carvel
Y'all niggas best to hold your weight like barbell
To my verbal swordsman school, students don't play truant
My most prudent pupil, rhyme under influence
Of alcohol and to-bacco, mushrooms imported from morocco
Bellies on the rocks, and a twenty sack of choco
Wit forty tales and gold around the fist, bitch I carve
Glitters on the paper so my family won't starve


I'm deep in the shit, I stay highly involved
Never inconceited, never been beated
Been trapped in many wars but not yet retreated
My style you need it, I just write to read it
It's all fresh lyric, no nothing gets repeated
I came a long way and guess what, I succeeded
I conquer my opponent, and feed him baby food

Cause he's childish and illiterate, and ye has been rude
To the father year me, o-r-i-g
Respond to the war wit the killa bee law


Scavenger nigga, you's a shhriimp
A full line of shhiit, my ear can digest iiit
Stop drinkin all that water, let's take it to the land
So I can godzilla up your shit mister tiny tim man
Niggas be creepin up my beanstalk
When I start to come down on your f**kin ass
You tried to chop shit on up
Played my shit like parks bitch, I'm that


Legendary microphone's weaponary
You secondary bitch-ass fairies
Scary cats won't survive this verbal attack
You think you're slang can match
The wu-tang, emphatically now cypher
You fake crumbs, you should be stung on your tongue
While you young guns bunge, we plunge into the grunge
Deep into the dark dungeon, we come in one wind
Nine minds combine to form the wisest rhyme force to summon
I be the quoted mathematical combination
Unloadin mysteries of life, you feel my solar wind blowin


Just then, I came on the stage like wind
Blew slang in your face and it touch your skin
You felt chilly, just like you smoked a bag of illy
You need a coat just to protect your throat
Two pairs of socks, kid I'm cold like ice rise
Chap-lipped duds can't f**k wit the chatterbox
Cherry heads felt the draft of the ox
Shaolin niggas won't f**k wit one block *pause*
Broke forgot about half the slang murderer
Down wit the union big street sling murderer
Terrorizin, move I'm tranquelizin
Fast getaway wit the slow speed drivin
Two miles an hour, cappa do it wit the power
Somebody blow something, cut fool in the tower




Yeah, start wit that one
Yo, yo, yo


My acoustic pugilistic lingustic rap fabric
Is a mixture of Arabic, Sanscrit, English, italics
I talk quick, y'all bitches can't comprehend my dick release spit
But love should I release hits
We travel through bodies like blood vessels
While y'all crab niggas try to wrestle to be on top of this pedestal
Slang doctrine, minoxin, lyrical toxin, I'm chessboxin
Words is rushin through like a herd of angry oxen


Fatal for these pussy cat niggas is dead weight
Concentrate, my murder rate excellerate, terminate
So spoil like coke in the foil
Knock knock, I shot the whole block
Electricity, flow splendidly
Internally inside of me like Tony Starks tee
I create excellency, one-sixty call L-O-U-N-G assist me
Papi wardrobe is key, roll promptly
For slang hall, vocabulary Igor, Frankenstein mind
Rewind for a minute while I dig down your track, stupid
I move quick shit is accurate, Kojack tactics
Chaos, killa bee minds, high society blackness, spread the rumor


My lyrical marvel makin more cream than Carvel
Y'all niggas best to hold your weight like barbell

So I can Godzilla up your shit mister Tiny Tim man
Niggas be creeping up my beanstalk
When I start to come down on your fucking ass
You tried to chop shit on up

Chap-lipped duds can't fuck with the chatterbox
Cherry heads felt the draft of the ox
Shaolin niggas all fuck with one block..
They forgot about the big Cappa slang murderer
Down with the union big street sling murderer
Terrorizing, move I'm tranquilizing
Fast getaway wit the slow speed driving
Two miles an hour, Cappa do it wit the power
Somebody blow something, cut fool in the tower




Yo! It's the burial ground sound, Dunn!
It's real out here
Staten Island puttin chills in y'all niggas
Forever in it.. yo


My devastating hot '97 mentality
Keep me on point for my four-digit salary
Heavyweight lyric never lost one calorie
I'm soon to be seen on the TV screen
Gambino Cappaccino to the Afro Sheen
Stay black, where I'm at, high road to rap council
Splash love to Wu in a orderly tonsil
Never limit to the diction, cause chaos to mixin
Brutalize a sound check, ripple through the intermission
Rap's under siege, held tight like a squeeze
Forced in the world 'Donna nuclear freeze
Doing damage to the wannabe Flip Mode and Def Squad
Ruckus a whirlpool in the rap entourage
If you dare to test thirty-six, chambers of strangers
Not word of mouth, or song, real wigs might peel
Livin large and in charge branch out Bon Voyage
Twenty-four diamond government named God
Alias Daryl Hill bring thugs back to kill
Circle around my son, Daryl Jr. never eatin lard
Auntie Dauntie sixteen holdin me down
AIDS of rap music may be contagious to sound
Verbal the slang pushed back to create pronoun
Method forcin J-Love to Bring the Pain from underground
Realizin food for thought is self-compromising
Shaolin cut the crack into a triple-O sizin
Blue do what he do to keep that currency risin
Hopin I catch a deal so we can catch a four-wheel
Instead of catchin bodies, niggas not keepin it real
I dirt bomb niggas that steal cake from stores
That's my type of niggas I be wanting on my tours
Can't help it, my styles stay fat like Roseanne
Ruckus in the square I stay rough like the Clan
Panther on my arm, pen and pad in my hand
Punk motherfuckers better beware of the Shaolin
Defy interactive project Children of the Corn
Gats on my man keep em bustin till ya gone
Style so ancient it sparks just like the unicorn
Donna come through everyday my uniform
Changes and switches, I came to make ladies out of bitches
Crackhead niggas get stitches
So what up with that kid, danger when I attack, kid
Watch how the slang hits you just like a bat, kid
Form another pyramid, look how we slid
All over Park Hill, Stapleton politic
On a twenty dollar bill all in it together
You can't fuck with the stormy weather, yaknahmean?


To the year Born God all the Gods strike hard
Fast from the swine hold down your boulevard
Father-U the C-Cipher, start the revolution
Middle finger in the air, for slang prostitution




Bob Digi, U G.O.D, Raekwon the Chef, the Inspectah Deck
M.E.T.H.O.D., the B.O.B.B.,
Straight up, Masta Killa, the GZA/The Genius
It's the Ol' d-d-d- d-d-d- d-d-Dirty Bastard!

 1, 2, 1, 2, (Killa Beez) turn it up
The headphones, turn it up.. yo you hear me?
 Whattup Tony?
 Wassup don-don?
 All the way up...
 You know how we do...
 Let's get this paper together...

 You know how I do...
 Sound about to go in on some real Wu shit, uh huh
 W-T-C
 That's right
 Ya know what I mean?
 GHOST-FACE KILLAH!
 Lemme give y'all the bullshit hook for y'all niggas
Check it out...


The burners and the stash, we 'bout the cash
We got females that got it like that
The golden childs that bone the crowd
See, niggas in the place that bit my style
Well, I'm a singer, dancer, we bulletproof brothers
Wu-Tang got the answer
Cause if I had a chance to do it again
I will still keep the heat in my pants-uh


Y'all be nice to the crackheads, everybody listen up
I shot one of my bitches, the ho ain't trick enough
Word life to big screen Don, tapping dustbones out
With starwriters like I fucked Celine Dion
Stuck everything that's the god's honest beyond
We airin' niggas out, that's the type shit that we on
Official Wu-Tang headbanger
Flood your space with big waves like you did in Sri Lanka


I drink heavy gallons of cru, play the big part
Niggas got squid on the grill, selling kids Clarks
Finesse notes, yo, the Guess on with the vest pose
Yellow swede one matching hat with the grey gun
Niggas be rhymin' for nothing, then my team pull up
We all throw down y'all broke niggas stay frontin'
Lines come digital stupid, plus ain't got no jewelry on
Bet I'm still live and I'm coopin'
Two of my silverbacks run through a pack of your wolves
Front on react, we're sippin' Cognac  relax dude
Know I'm with these cracks dude


Yo, 1-2, Dirt McGirt
Solid tone smith with 6th shots, lick shots
Leave your head like a Shaolin monk with 6 dots
Brooklyn Zoo, Zoo
Brooklyn Zoo


It's the return of Bin Laden, grab your armor
Smash pretty boy niggas, crush their karma
Eat bones with alligators, roll deep with my entourage
My whole crew's fresh out the bars
Diggler AKA the Cab Driver
Drop him off in the middle of fire
Dirty Island, drag bodies to the Murderland
Knock niggas out hurtin' my hand


I remember in the elevator we was playin' corners
Now we play the corners and the cops is stayin' on us
Staten's where the war is
Where the court system's running out of warrants
Where TNT be jumping out the Taurus
For real I can't call it
You see I love Lucy cause she Lawless
Exactly like that 1-0-3-0-4 is
Snitch niggas swallow your tongue
Already know the island I'm from
And y'all don't want no problems with them


We got a history full of lightning victories
Conceptual breakthrough, it ain't no mystery
Long vision from giants in every way
Rap czars, magnificent flows for every day
From the East to the 'ville, from the West to the hills
Incredible rhymes, encouraging skills
From rat packs, the smallest crews were enormous
We hit 'em fast with an effortless performance
MCs start fleeing in flocks
Especially those that's more sensitive to heat and shock


We grindin' down to the bone, my name grounded in stone
I'm Mr. Violence we loungin' with chrome
Mr. Violence we lounge in his home, hit the housing on Rome
Shining like a hundred thousand in stones
Move mountains with poems, got a jones for dinero
1-6-zero my songs we throwin' elbows
The hoes cling, sho thing, we know kings
Only dime dikes with minds right, we choose Queens


Yeah, we wild like rockstars who smash guitars
Yo son split his face with the toast, he ain't ghost
It's no joke iron coat rifle with the stroke
One toke brains float, shot to the throat
Before the smoke hit, witness the killing, chilling crime scene
Body on the block, eyes open from the shock
Of being popped in the neck
Yet he still held a lit cigarette between his fingers
Danger when you step into the chamber with the Masta
Disaster, gotta blast ya cause I have to


The rat pack is back from the island of Stat'
Leave you cursed dust, cause you worship the Gat
The first one to snap drunk off the Smirnoff
Blow the bouncer's ear off, let him floss he the boss
Handcuffed, to the turntables like Wizard Theodore
See it's pure, let it rain pearly ounces
Bang him with the thing that hang from the trousers
You don't want no drama, I'm flaming fast
That nigga jumped up and did the Damon Dash




Wake up... wake up
Wake up...


Wake up, get a hold of your life, go get your cake up
The motto in the streets is you eat, or you get ate up
Straight up, you tired of waiting, go get your weight up
My peoples tired of waiting for reparations to pay us
Screaming Jesus can save us, I, I get the Bentley if I save up
But that's just another trick to enslave us
Push the minimum wages
Put, put our fathers up in them cages
Then watch out when mother struggled to raise us
But, but my ambition won't let me live in this poor condition
That doesn't care about color, creed, or your religion
Priests, politicians gotta listen to opposition
From my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in
From my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in


Allah said to save the babies from the cold
Pour wisdom in the cup so the truth overflows
Still, knowledge is that bread that keeps us well-fed
Old time religion will not bring us satisfaction
Without action now who can disagree with me?
God is not a mystery, there's nowhere in history
That you could show and prove to me
But still you face east and nod your head to me religiously
I'm G-O-D, to infinity, for real


The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me


Poor reparations, the Bush administration
Unequality, martial law, segregation
False hood, false teaching, false education
Now's the time for us to come amongst this nation
They deceiving us, they don't believe in us
They believe in that Cream like Julius Caesar
I'm like Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X with the heaters
Ripping the chains of the remains of all of the leaders
Never worship the image of evil swine eaters
I'm on the back of the bus with two fine divas
We in the jungle of life, but never jungle fever
I'm God-body all day long, spiritual life lessons
That I recite in this song
Trying to wake up everybody, can't we all get along?
For all my people that's out there persevering through the storm
Black fist, Staten Island, stand up, stand strong
Penetrate through the gate and bring the Clan along


The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me


Wake up and realise the times
That we living in the world is getting more iller than ever
Thought we was chillin', striving change for the better
But it was a dream like Martin Luther
He had a vision that could move a mountain
Protect one another, that's world to my brother Malcolm
As-salamu alaykum, alaykum as-salam
We want justice, police supposed to protect and serve
And then they shoot us down like wild animals
The nerve of them cold-hearted killers
With blue suits slaying our black youth
The earth cries from all the blood that's being spilled
We need a solution fast, get InshAllah bill
Let me educate them, translate it meaning God's will
It goes all in together, together how we are
To stand with a plan, provided we down to fall
And that's the Willie Lynch tactics that separated the masses
Taught us all to think backwards




The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me

We gonna change the world (x5)




Yeah
Another exclusive (uh huh)
Its that piff for your mind
Study, get your mind right
Little homie (I see you)
Little mama (uh huh)
Straight up the doctor is in
Its that penicillin
Ay yo
Yeah


My eyes all red
My head filled with blunt smoke
I'm out here struggling
And I still can feel hope
My job not ready
Paychecks not steady
I used to sell drugs
Just me and my man Henny
Now I'm out here flipping these raps
To enlighten the youths
Life is more than selling crack
On the project stoops
I came from nothing
But I always kept my roots
Don't floss on them
Show them how to stack their loot
Intelligent minds we think alike
Utilize my gift
Music make people unite
Spirits uplift, see through the sun's light
The kids loving it
My universal sound
And yo I do it for the public
We discovery shit
All my fans want to cuddle with this
Protect my family from the police sticks
Pancakes, grits in the morning at six
Hot boys running up in the bricks
Welfare mixtape yeah fame (?)
I eat them beats up
Man pass a toothpick


Yo we never going to stop
Getting this paper
As long as we black you can count on that
And if you from the projects
Yo we got your back
Best believe, true indeed
That's an actual fact
Yo we never going to stop
Getting this paper
As long as we black you can count on that
And if you from the projects
Yo we got your back
Best be believing son
Ayo its actual fact




Im kill this track
Like you violated the family
I rock off of any beat
These rappers not jammin me
Do it like the Indian, guerilla or animal
No matter what you pull out
Im still going handle you
Plot and planned on me
Im harder to fade
Mosh ink and mark go
With the sharp flow
I'll T bomb everything
Like last soap and weasel
Avenue crew shit, niggas got diesel
Im charged up
All of my hoops is in the house
Groupies wanna crush
Play mad junk, get knocked up
They get you locked up
Might be up in the gym
But yo im never stuck
I tell the truth and i shame the devil
Yeah
And keep an insane watch
With a crazy bezel
Cause the time is now
And I gotta stay ghetto so when I leave
Everybody know I was sterile
Bomp, bomp
Gotta represent you


Intoxicating
The state that I leave you in
Im like a hallucinogen
That rub I put you in
Every bar, every verse that I hit you with
Depicts a lyrist so extensive and proficient
Yes Im coming with that street shit
Realistic
O intense my heat text is 101
As vocalists is dawning
Melting tracks like hot wax
Plastic and molten lava
My mental revolver
Turning a glutton into a starver
Better check that 36 chamber
Leaving cynics in the mental clinic
Have your thoughts rearranged
And reversing stereotypes
Yes its a dangerous combination
No need for further explanation
Aint nobody got time for smiling and faces
Portraying roles thats going place em
We about to settle these cases
Motherfuckers be on the lookout
For a nigga with black hair


You can never keep a good man down
And my flows unstoppable
I step on any obstacle
I keep boppin it
I shoot from the top of the stoop
Drivin the booth
Hoppin the coop
Take a break or shoppin it too
Coppin a suit
Knockin the booth nigga
We killin everything
Like we coppin a shoot
Rot epinephrine
With eyes that cut 10
Niggas betta run
Im bout to turn into a nutso
Keep wildin out
There will never be enough
I got the new york fitted on
Dutch is green
White t-shirt, act, levi jeans
Popin wardrobe
To all ma niggas that ride doe
Clean as a in 
Deemin respect
Hyenas invest
My team is the best
We beat it to death
Yea motherfucker
I be feenin for meth
Cleanin everything like
Im cleanin the tech
Me and my niggas come thru
Like we genies in rap


Feel like a thousand days
A thousand nights
Could write a 30 set collection
Tribulations of life
A mello-drama drama
Mellow cause I stay with marijuana
Semicolon, comma
Pause that consult the lama its deep
Coordinates is seldomly reached
Beyond you mediocre thinking
Intellectual geeks
No describing these streets
Explanation on my custom
Yo liposuction, titty implants and cell abduction
Dont be cloning it
You want the sperm out ma dick
We do arithmetic
Figure this shit
Dominant, you recessive
Stressing cause my flavors impressive
The rest is only the ingredients to why your oppressive


Im Blake Griffin in the optimum
Aint no saving them
Grizzly winters and summers
Dead bodies in the hummers
Shooting at the undercovers
Why my brother wayne on nightline
Fifty babies round my way dying
Two to the head, one to the spine, jeft at the crime
But I did the time, I aint give the feds no answers
Runnin with niggas, that smuggle brick in da bra
As well as their grandmamas pampers
Will kill your girls sisters boyfriend like a 
 suin in them red socks
You no rasta cause you got dreadlocks
Orange juice, moscato, moet, rasta boy
Blowin that stick wiz kalifa, duckin the reefer
In the six series, playin in the 
Bumpin in that  murder inc Gadafi
Capadonna street dreamer Monopoly
The revolver is a bad bitch, Nicky swayze
Shot with snow bunnies
In the pum pum jeans shorts
Daisy, coming out of baisley
Surfing that osca pollo like them donnias
And get them desert eagle red sonias
Its my time nigga word to gano, gone yo


Get that
With ma lyric impact capadonna




Against The Grain feat. Cappadonna, Block McCloud, and Solomon Childs

Truncated Chorus, Block McCloud:

It seems it doesn't matter how hard I try
I'm thinking it's love but getting paid
I don't even know the reason why
I'm thinking it's love but its a game

Verse 1, Cappadonna:

Can't live without my money
Can't live without my weed
Can't live without my seed
All these haters that dealing with greed
Yeah, fuck y'all niggas one time
Thinking y'all niggas gonna stop my shine
Nigga, I'm too far into my grind
Y'all niggas gonna remember my name
'cause all this money and all this fame
Nigga, I ain't never go against that grain
What you niggas know about this pain?
Bang, bang, bang!
Y'all m'fuckers better stay in y'all lane
Bang, bang, bang!
Y'all m'fuckers better stay in ya'll lane
Bang, bang, bang!
Y'all m'fuckers better stay in ya'll lane


Chorus 1, Block McCloud

Seems it doesn't matter how hard I try
I'm thinking it's love but getting paid
I don't even know the reason why
I'm thinking it's love but its a game
Seems it doesn't matter how hard I cry
I'm wishing for sun but getting rain
I don't even have the will to fight
It's not even worth going against the grain

Verse 2, Chuckie Campbell

From the dying of the light, let it all manifest
Scrolls unfold from the bones of the dead
No man here is safe from the curse of the flesh
Words unsaid in the fog of your breath
Believing in the wisdom that I kept in inner-visions
Interfering intervention that I felt -- press
On into the psychic premonitions in my lyrics
Was it ever for the love and respect? -- yes
I rep for the air in my esophagus
'til I die mummified in a sarcophagus
Resurrect just to rise in a metropolis
With a hologram of 2Pac as my accomplice
Hypothesis: if you go against the grain
Forget about the money and the fame
Write it for the love and the pain
You might just blow and get paid
But more go broke and get played
And more die here of heartbreak -- falling
Victim to the vivid dualistic propositions
Propagated dream sequence
Hero/villain way of thinking
Sleeping with the sheep 'til they wake
I nod to my audience, bow on stage
Give my heart to the few who remember the name
Giving back to the culture what it gave to me
With a heart built to go against the grain

Chorus 2, Block McCloud, (x1)

Verse 3, Solomon Childs

I'm 'bout to book it
Ducking and dodging the pigs
I can't afford to do them bids
I got this work on me
My momma need money
Meanwhile the feds on me
Fuck-boys is plotting on me
Chopping bricks like karate
Pushing narcotics too tight
Hustle all day and all night
Or to the break of dawn
Or to the dawn break
Young kingpin
Money like I hit the sweepstakes
Hard knock life
Feel these high stakes

Chorus, Block McCloud (x1)

End Song




Yeah, yeah, Six came with a hot ass track
The Black Knights is mothafuckin' back
Close that mothafuckin' door
We don't wanna hear no echoes
Hell no, blaze that weed up
This mothafuckin' shit is about to let loose
Ah yea, blaze that shit
We from the city of the Queen Mary and the Spruce Moose
Long Beach to Compton, niggas is on these


Street smart, strong darts
Come from the heart, can't fall apart
Slacked off and now it's time to show the real value of the Rugged Monk
Fuck y'all marks, my niggas thug it up
Wu-Wear and chucks, the Knights, we just don't give a fuck
Criticize about this and that, Black Knights done Pillaged that
Fuck that, keep the shit real, y'all niggas love my raps
Not just that, the style of Knights got ya actin' wild
Demolishin' styles, watch Monk rock the crowd
All killas, we gang members and rap niggas
With black Tecs, pull more cards and pull spreads
With killa instincts, peep my rugged technique
I, slay MC's if you wanna battle in these streets
On beat or raw beat, I gotta keep it complete
You can't fuck with my crew, what ya, thought I was weak?
Feel the effect, Black Knights live on the set
Protect Ya Neck before you be the first one to get swept
Let 'em know, it's the..


It's the Black Knights, Almighty Black Knights
There's no beginnin' and there is no end
Fuckin' with us, you don't have no wins
Fuck this is my groove


The Knights hold mic's like black gats
So MC's hold ya money stack, heard ya funny raps
Copped ya tape, got my money back, the shit ya spit is wack, black
Black Knights, we don't deal with that
Killa Beez attack from the West, now can you fuck with that?
Hell no, that's like a mountain compared to a pebble
Ya stale flows'll never be able to match the levels
That I'm on, you silly rap niggas gotta be head-strong
Battlin' me is like tryin' to run when the infrared's on
I won't miss, so you can just kiss that ass bye-bye
You silly fucks should've learned to duck when I let lead fly
Doc Doom is dangerous, straight from Los Angeles
You can't hang with the Swatch gang, so bang to this
And riders ride to this, plug you like appliances
Real street scientists adapt to all environments
Heat firin', got big niggas perspirin'
Slugs slap ya dome, put ya in gangsta retirement




Eh-yo, spit fire, rapid fire, guns for hire
Gat tossin', chains flossin', fame and fortune
Killa Beez, Black Knights, killa trees, blacks and white
Rush the bloods, get a load of these
Official car body, dart specialty
Nourish ya tendencies, captivatin' ya headquarters
Take over borders, sons and daughters, police tape recorders
Can't receive this, Compton and Killa Hill, all skill
X pill, coke in D'eville, hoes and clothes, anything goes
Bring it, Holocaust sing it
We do it together, whatever, whatever
Fuckin' wit us, that's never, never
Wild out like we found the lost treasure
Burn a bag of that endo too
W-E, spells we, what you gon' do?




The West Coast Killa Beez is too strong
And Wu-Tang Clan money is too long
It's too long..

Police hating on me
They dont like how my style be
That deep ass posse shit

Ol youn nigga gave that motherfucker 


Run this game nigga
Lock, stock and barrel
Nigga want front
But they sporting our apparel
Speak against us
But only talking bout us
Thats why we moving in
Roads thats never travelled
Expiration, deeper investigation
Every obstacle
More knowledge in the making
If its possible we get in deeper conversation
Philosophical, scientific combination
Before that, snitching corporations
No illuminati
Its the business aspirations
For the black administration
Who lack the motivation
Looking like americas ready for the taking
Terrorism, talking longer on the television
Fresh, new ideas
We goin make em listen
Why?
Cause we talking with
Advertising budget  in your favorite shows


Seen your eye in the fire
Lions and tigers
Its a jungle out here
Somebodys always dying
Mothers is crying
Babies is dying
Disease is at an all time high an
And gasoline I at the highest it ever been
But whos to blame
Whose name can we call
Fucked up
We all seen the buildings fall
But still I keep a clear mind
For the next time
Looking for another airplane to pass by
I keep an eye in the sky
Put my hand on my gun
Im not a trackstart so you know I dont run
But when disaster strikes
Casualties will happen
Look at all the bodies they pulled from out of manhattan
Attend to the plot
Ten years and theyd already forgot
9/11 was a dirty plot


Hook off (echoes)


Every thursday night
Your martial arts class
I go down
To the legal beagle
See if jack chapper is there
If we exchange gloves
He gets three points
If he wins
If I win
I 







I jump off the building
I land in first class
I was only 13
When she gave me my first ass
I remember KC gave Sherman a dirt back
From the wild streets
Where nobody say we worth trash
Put God first, then vocabulary, church maths
Quiet, go higher
Then you start to admire
Swing Reverend in the house
You steppin in my fire
Bells ring
Angels appear
I throw spears
Beyond the clouds
Yea I sing it for every child
When go go foul
I feed mine from exile
So special
Peep ma next style
Guaranteed to get the flex out
Never stressed out
Came back and now hes stressed out
Up in the hills with black
My dawg remo
Watched my team glow
Let the steam blow
Still on my theme tho
So all yall brothers
Better line up and pay attention
Haters and enemies better line up for detention
Me and my henchmen
Moving like french men
Burn the dutch master
Burn good incense
The harder we go
The shit get intense
Niggas fuck around
Its goin be a bad incident
Sue woo
36 chambers in an instant
Never get fenced it
Coco 


You make em listen
Came to give em what they missin
Turn this whole game
Into a verbal composition
Life, position be like that of a right
He aint holding a pen
Like what the fuck should I write
See everybody here be on the sterotype
I aint the one to follow suit
Aint wearing your tights
Will know with my intelligence
Search for higher heights
Seeking better understanding
Words like advice
From christ or buddha
A vicious barracuda
Rhymes like pen on 
So they consume us
You heard im nice
Well im better than the rumors
Can hardly even fathom
How we making these moves
You blessed or sumtin
Are you next door frontin
You may made this shit
But you cant take nothin away
We either get broke or get paid
Better make your choice
Or get the fuck up out the way nigga


Shae the Ape
Gorilla like King Kong
Yea..move them things back and forth
Like ping pong
Michael Corleone
Pinky ring on what?
I kill a beat
Getting the sting on
Now pulverise anything that im on
I keep swing on
These corners you clingin on to
You wanna ride or collide
Bring it on
Guns been supplied
The silencer spinned it on
Lets get it on
For sure get your fitted on
Mac 11, squeeze til his middles gone
I dont nuts or force cups
With bad chicks
Who grown up but fold up
When the man kick
Mad gits wanna clash with the beast
Its like jurassic park
Not a rap to the 
Enemies wanna pass in the street
The only way you pass
Is when I pass the heat


Hook Off (echoes)





I see ya racing in the (?) Gimme that bitch!
Always in the war, damn
You heard?
Kidding!
Busta rollin' with the best motherfuckers in the game right now
Come on!



We got the illest team
We swarm like killa beez
You can chop like guillotine
Cause only I'm a living dream
Can-I-Bus is in me
I bust a rhyme deliver C's
Best believe it baby I'm a living dream


Check, see how the streets will get you stopping and looking
When I'm in the kitchen seasoning the concoction and cook and look
A lot of you niggas trash like it's hard just to step it up
The guru with a gourmet, a scientist and a chef in a
A restaurant for the heat and a deli that will always serve the hood
24 hours, feeding niggas the hors-d'oeuvres
God rap prophecy, Bust Rhymes the Great
Prepare a full course meal, juice leakin' from the steak
Check, acting like you ain't knowing, you niggas must be idiots
Yeah I know my name already, Bus Rhymes and affiliates
But slip mode in this bitch, the alliance must be kinda serious
Damnit Jerry thing in the building regardless where it is
The way I saturate the street I'm only saying
I ravenly feed the hood like I'm a fast food chain
No need to ever question why the hood love me
Got a aliens and vegetarians to feed you if you hungry


Debauchery
Ain't no peace in poverty
Keep watchin' me
Blow your ass up like 
Know the psychology
Nigga don't lie to me
Disaster strikes
Yeah that's prophesy
Theocratic liberal faggot right wing fascist
Democratic crack addict
Politics is a language
54th Street downtown
Maroon Lincoln Navigator
Music is loud, the usual crowd
The center of attention is where all the energy is directed
It's deceptive so I stand corrected
Top tier rated review
Same as you - say it ain't true
I put a nigga to shame in the booth
Difference between me and them
Fingerprints and dick size
Bad Leroy Brown Spaz like Spetznaz
Lumberjack on steroids
Break you off with my bare hands boy
Sledgehammer to the groin
So many ways to control the human animal
The strategy's to make the world more manageable
More or less best protect your neck, guard your chest
The war of attrition
Them niggas starved in the trench
Only the strong survive
You know the monster's always gonna try
Those with a conscience probably gonna die





Hot tub
Hubs guard the watchdog
The watchdogs watch the socks boil
I got them ox tail plates and now you hailmarble top soil
Your plots foil like wetlands from onyx soil
I broil flocks
Smoke silver like an arctic fox
No bark but shots don't hard compress the rocks
Watch the target burn through your chestplate
Dextro metal face my scripts broke penetrate
Clicks go fist throat, separate wrist throat
Butterfly shank you lightweight
I lift scopes in a sworn ceremony
Master next lift ropes
Attorney stiff as soul cough as I row
To assist to lift your soul
Sift soul fragments of your skull
Detroit Piston man a place to Indiana brawl
Scuba dive a landing strip
Mess hall to balls in
Put 'em asleep since I'm slept on
Yes, ya'll




I'm the big conquerin' lion
From outta Mount Zion
My things is like two pins made from Wolverine iron
You had dreams I was down with the Mayans
I hunt witches, chop heads off Medusa
Can't block out McCloud, he a crazy producer
All my homies stay tight like me and my Hoovers
Bang out that's young nigga shit
I don't hang out
Might see me after ma saw Jimmy Kane house
I'm gifted stay away from wood
Niggas and safe bitches
Jesus feed your whole team with 2 fishes
The angel of rap destroyed demons and death wishes
Even my homeboy act very suspicious
Got team on the track
Little brother come get this
Mos Def would declare but I'm Common with kisses
And I'm 50 when it's time to get down in the ditches





* promotional EP released on Razor Sharp Records in late '97

Chorus: U-God

Hysterical lyrical launch, anotha riddle
A miracle little by little, fits right up the middle
*repeat 2X*


Let us milk this cow, the best way we know how
Park Hill projects, chicka-POW
One culture, return of the track slasher
Double doser, Cappadonna broadcaster
Strivin for perfection, the only way I got
My life back was through investin, devotion
Movin my soul toward the skit, vocabulary
Comin out my ass like shit, to feed my babies
I gotta fight y'all MC's, this money
Be gettin me high just like trees in these tracks
I milk for all my childhood, make me feel good
So I keep on writin meditatin in the ghetto
Makin love waitin for lost minds to settle
Then I speak out, because we all need the guidance
Deep down inside is where you could define science
My mother told me, when I was so stressed out
"All you gotta do is just put your best out"
And I did it

Chorus 2X


Yo, new Cappadonna is about to exhale kid
Hold all the phone calls, stop all the mail
Cappadonna raise hell, speak and I broke the shells
Seen brothers that fell when I slipped
I had my alibi tight that night, up in the Hill chillin
Y'all'll get shot, move away things are too hot
Look at my spot now, friends are exiled from close distance
I broke resistance, every time I step up, I rip reps up
Ku Klux, my words swing around like numchucks
This ain't for big bucks, never can quit this rap shit
It feeds my seeds, I can barely breathe
But y'all cats better believe keep off, your darts are soft
While I throw these missiles, at your skin tissue
You can't escape I absorb, gigantic crowds all aboard
Watch out for city fraud, my darts slam like doors
Makin it hard for you to get yours, selfish

Chorus 2X



Yeah this one right here go out to all my baby mothers
Baby mommas

Fix my tie on my neck
Then I step to acute piece
I love my baby mothers
Cause that's where my roots be
Keisha, Starcia, Shinade, Drianna
I love all ya'll children like I love my momma
Trying to take care of mine, I don't need no drama
I just love my family like my name Obama
Strive with me, if you family then vibe with me
I work hard for mines, get on sides with me
Feed my seeds, get 'em clothes, cut their hair, wipe their nose
These are things I like to do, that's why I be doing shows

Ya'll still in my heart and I keep ya'll close
For all the time I didn't have nothing and ya'll kept me afloat
And this one's for my children that ya'll should be raising
While I'm stuck in the grind writing rhymes at the Days Inn
This ones for you my beloved
More love, more support, more time, more patience
I pay child support (?) statement
Still love, still not hating
Family, that's what it is to me
It all comes naturally, attached to me
Send 'em back to me

Get out that room, that's daddy's weed
Daddy on (and daddy look good)

That's a family right there
I got love for all ya'll
Beautiful women
Family tree ya'll
Stick together
This is the end
Of the conflict
Between baby's daddies and baby's mothers
United
Time for a change
And it starts right now, right here
Baby mommas




Listen; calm nerve with the best herb
Meditation good for the mastermind expansion
Nothing diluted or tampered
Rhyme raw, you snort it'll make your nose bleed
My words on paper take shape and form
Killarmy's that bomb atomically, you've been warned
Your family will mourn the lose, you rap wannabees
Testing the true MC, why risk it?
You're better off slicing your wrists, don't miss
You shoot you better hit me
Peace to my brother Slick original foundation
Stack brick like a master mason, when I build
Real ill like an NFL skill drill still
Yo 9th, let's snatch about 10 mil and chill


Me and my nigga 9th Prince hopped off the cactus
Hit out Jerus', all crazy and hostile
Gotta watch out for the pop out boys they might pop you
Stop on any block, twist 
Honies everywhere, yo the Gods is Power
Half the floor's on something, slip in the bar
Killa hill Army, yo take a flick of the stars
Champagne in the spotlight panties and bras
Educated rich black kids, with scars
At the Farrakhan march yo the world is ours
The glitter, all in my family, the trucks and cars
Never dumb black people, thoughts travel to Mars
Then we add on to life by constantly elevating
Avoid the bitch niggas that's out there ovulating


Just something know, this is my life and



Egyptology try not to acknowledge thee
Verbal biology biochemical poetry
Stroll the streets, black Jesus looking for a Judas
Heirs appointed hazardous to your brain not to pursue this
I open up your imagination like George Lucas
And leave the microphone spinning like a cyclone
Headed for the red zone
You niggas are fake, like titties with silicone
Make way, only a few can stay
Those that stray get sprayed with the AK
Western civilization psychology try to follow me
Demolish me. me and my Killarmy
But I'm in tune with the universe like I study cosmology
Killah with the flow is my policy
Raise your flag is this hip-hop democracy
Here I come hear the sounds and feel the vibration of my drums
African descendant, transcendent
My evolutionary origin begins
Way back when scientists started figuring
The 9th Prince has no beginning or ending
Rappers still pretending, and selling niggas the illusion
Where's the contribution, I rewrite the Constitution
Cappadonna, my persona's filled with honor
The 9th Prince carry on the Wu-Tang Saga






Ok
Let's go now
We in the summertime
Watching a dice game
Chicks walk by
Fly with nice frames
Small shoe, long hair, and a (?)
She get me out the block
I might give her my real name
Everybody out playing
Plus the water's on
Stones on the corner
Getting their quarters on
Chick still beefing over this one's meatball
And brothers act like a fool
Like they don't know about (?)
Live at the barbecue
Pasta and meat sauce
A little kid full now
From eating like three dogs
Bathroom closed plus liquor store runs
Another box of beer and some hamburger buns
People getting together and doing our 2-step
No matter where you from or what crew you rep
I like these days we can all have fun
Just set aside all the beef and put down your gun
Let's have a barbecue


That's a good time
That's a cookout
That's a barbecue
People dancing, enjoying themselves
Get your black books out
Its a good time, its a good life
At the barbecue
Honey's eating, laughing
We socializing hope you doing that too
Its a good time, its a good life
At the cookout
At the barbecue
Nobody's charging you
Its a barbecue, its a barbecue


The fly yellow Wallys
Beef steak Charlies
Me and my shortys
Piff and my co-ds
We up in this bitch like
Nigga we're O.G.s
More money, more love
Soul in the four keys
Devil back there
Sip wine, eat hoagies
Never kill nothing if we ain't got to go deep
The barbecue's good
We don't fuck with that pork meat
New York creep country (?) and grill beef
Jive bone, tell mom her greens are still sweet
We all love like family out in the street
Run (?)
Sodas in the freezer
Oh look at that, she's a skeezer
Block fever
Positive god degree, African cheeba
Can we meet up on the roof tonight
Coming out the speaker
I'm getting weaker
Music in the woman philosophically
Peaced up, East up
All of my dogs is creased up
Feast up, wrap it up
Wrapping pheasant
While I'm grabbing a tea cup
Nigga the barbecue is tweaked up



That's a good time
That's a cookout
That's a barbecue
People dancing, enjoying themselves
Get your black books out
Its a good time, its a good life
At the barbecue
Honey's eating, laughing
We socializing hope you doing that too
Its a good time, its a good life
At the cookout
At the barbecue
Nobody's charging you
Its a barbecue, its a barbecue




Bar-ten-der, let me buy a round for all my ladies
Bar-ten-der, let me see what's kickin' game can do


Yo, the first night I seen ya, I admit
Girl you had a thug on some "i'mma buy ya shit"
Mama, if you need spice, I can re ya up
I can be your sugar daddy, ice a g and up
Or I can be that lost love missing in ya past
Or that tingle on your tongue dippin' in ya glass
Sittin' like a billboard, modeling the kiss
Buy a shot of crys', a bottle for your click
Followed by the slide in the leather hummer seat
Any words given to ya, promise I'mma keep
I'mma stay a thug, any drama found
Guaranteed to hold my momma down
I can make ya wrist freeze quicker than a cop
Lose me when your close, sick of when you're not
Liquor in the drop, rubbers in the glove
Bubbles in the tub, now show a nigga love




I love it when I'm wit a fly chick
Skin so pretty and an ass so thick
I'm always in the club, I ain't worried bout shit
Dipped on the regular, you see me with a bitch
Even if I'm smoked out, I can't be scoped out
Drink for the ladies when I pull my notes out
Dressed in ya tight ass shit, the nipples is poked out
Honeys lips was glossy, order the Henny's in the glasses that's frosty
You never lost me, I was crushing them other hoes, what you expect?
When you see me at shows, cracking mad bottles of Mo'
See act cobra, she really freaky
She look good, but she really sneaky
Hit 'em with the apple martini, that's creepy
Until she gets sleepy, that's my agenda
Aiyo, bartender, order a round for the hoes that's going down




Yo, now the question at hand, is, can I be ya man
Take you to the beach, have sex in the sand
The body should be banned with ya honey glow and tan
If time is money, honey, you're worth a gram
See I can make you love me, love me long time
Can my tongue tangeray, and how I bump and grind
The pleasure's all mine, forever and a day
My foreplay is like a torpe', when I jay
Fiesta, you got the look, I wanna know better
Bartender, every one Henny and Amaretto
On the house, cuz this could be my future spouse
Got me cheesing the cheese, like the cat and mouse
But no doubt, I get the job done like Big Daddy
And we can both gangsta lean in mean caddy
Cuz you'se a fatty, and I'mma fill ya cup
Cuz I wanna sex you up






Start the pompum circumstance music, this a graduation
(You know how we do), Cappadonna, Stan Steels, just a Specialist
You like that Spark, Donna


Baby girl you wine like a hoola dance
You looking real nice, gotta give you a chance
I can your pussy right through your tight pants
Poppin' out your whip, girl got the right stance
How bout some Crystal, we can burn a branch
Maybe later we can take it back to the ranch
You got it going on, baby, with ya ill Prada
When it come to ass, girl, got a whole lotta
I'm feeling you, come on, roll with the Don Dada
C-A-P, all in the club, with my G-A-T
I keep a fly bitch right next to me
Lay my mack game down, and I flex my G
I'm an off-the-hook-nigga, Supermodel king
Fly girl book nigga, love the way you move ya ass
And it shook nigga, let me blow it out the frame
Girl you gorgeous, and your whole crew's the same


Aiyo, this bitch is incredible
I'm try'nna get me a bedroom interview
Excuse me, ma, let ya girl get in front of you
This is Don-Don, love you with ya thong on, tell me to sign, boo
(Aiyo, that ass is exceptional
I'm try'nna get me a bedroom interview
Excuse me, ma, let ya girl get in front of you
This is Stanley Steels, and I'mma Specialist, check the credentials)


Uh-huh, uh-huh, papi show me what you talkin' bout (yeah)
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, I got the dick-down, bedroom crown you wanna see?)
Uh-huh, uh-huh, I think I like the way it's going down (yeah)
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, we can end the chat right now, tell me how it sound
Do you wanna leave?)


Aiyo, Steels probably king of the mattress
Luck, got the address, the pussy pimp's calling me MapQuest
She's an actress, that's why I'm leaving my signature
So I can 50 Cent me a Vivica
Listen, my seven sixty, the color of CD
Flowin' past these chicks ass looking like jelly fish
Please, ya'll won't see me riding on PB
Stomp big dicking the whip, can't you tell by the big feet
Please, I got a batting average out of the park
Every beat a homerun since Luck met with Spark
And it's probably the Latin in him
Cuz I ain't heard a mix this sick since Malone got with Shaq and 'em
That's why they call him Mr. Classic, it's never been the team
That I play for, it's the muthafucking match-up
Finesse flow, yo, the kid is immaculate
Lynn Swan of the game, that's what it read on my jacket
While ya'll sticking throwbacks to match your hat set
I'm, rewriting history, so follow the concepts
I'm out in Charm City whipping the baskets
Fuck a seat's with heat, why you ask for my arm rest
Luck and Donna, we the reason them chicks press
We blame it on features, ya'll base it on sneakers
Listen, dick game like Pole Position
All I do is bob and weave, once I'm in them jeans
And you can guarantee Luck is high quality
Like I'm Kweli and Hi-Tek, the sonic text
Please I caught my bi-chicks baking they eggs
Because's the mixtapes better, plus the two go together
Think about it, I'm a hot sex sizzler
Beat the cat flipper, breakfast is served
And you can get ya back ripped up
Homey tell clip's up, I move with the curb










You wasn't there for support
You fronted, now we gon' to court
It was years, now you wanna divorce?
Shed tears cause you feeling distort
Was it sincere with them feelings you brought
Kept it conceal, now you double-cross
We made vows, now I have to pay for a child and stay on trial
Baby we wild, all I can do is through you a sick smile
Fair well, hope you get ya share hell
What you thought, we didn't have to go through nothing?
What you afraid of losing something?
It's suppose to be u-s not the whole USA
You gon' regret this day, it's betrayal


Yo, all these niggas out here backbitting and snitching
Told the FEDS I stashed weed, mad blow in the kitchen
See me coming out the truck with a four in my grip
They was pointing at me, looking at my gear and my kicks
Peep this kids that I stuck up, and told 'em I did it
My niggas be smiling in my face and knowing they wicked
Send songs to the police, man, get 'em a plaque
Smile like a bud-head nigga, his mouth is the crack
Blowing the dice, stabbing straight in the back
Niggas smoke crack, stick niggas up when it's track
Watch how they run backwards, dirty like a fuck
You be seeing the rats
Sitting in the car with the boys that sneak out the door
They got photos of the clique when we was pitching the raw
Somebody telling, they giving up crazy information
Tryna parole the kid, but I'm already on probation
Witnesses at the police station
Laughing while they cover their faces


And those people you trust... yeah y'all be joking and stuff
Next thing you know you smoking on dust
They switched the blunt when you asked for a puff
Watch you get open and laying in the cut
Wearing ya luck, now you off guard and extract
Now you stuck, it ain't real when you tryna hit ya man's wiz
Tryna go up in the ribs, while he doing a bid
Crab snakes they backstab and left the knife break
Smile at you with a tight face
How you dig a man like that?
How you feel as a man as a rat?
How you not gon' handle the gat?
How you wait and see I'm falling in the trap?
It's not real, it's not real, if you are how you feel
It's not real, if you with the homies
But you making side deals
It's not real, if you won't blast the steel
Or grab the wheel, or take a hand for the bill
It's not real, it's fake



For real, for real...
Yo, this is based on a true story, from a Man that lost land...

Verse 1: (Cappadonna)

I'm goin' all out, I love trout
Black is what I be about
95-south all the way up, I tear mics up
Peep the conduct, wherever lightning struck
Tear the jail up, truck with the mind food
Truck with jewels, forget babylon rules
I'm crusin' with the angels
Goin' through Parkhill, let the Gods build and all of that
Graduation hats, bigger stacks
Ya'll hardly ever seen besides cream
I got the vaccine for ya'll uncle Tom rappers
I told ya'll before to be easy, Devils attackin' is practice
Provocative songs, yeah It's Donna, don't even panic
Hold ya'll like the Atlantic
Pillage at your service
Clubs start to get nervous
Loose lips, it's like emptyin' clips
Packed with the info, join the revolution
Slang prostitution, even if you boostin'
Play it like you still chill, homicide hill from the other side
My Mother sighed, strugglin, poor and tired
A Baby that never cried, a family that never died
I see everything from the outside

Chorus -

O.T.F. and The Pillage, we all comin' through
Watch your back nigga, and your girl watch it too
'cause we conduct big business, raw is how we give this
Live this, thats how we conduct big business
O.T.F. and The Pillage, hide your shine nigga
When we come through, might have to jump on you
'cause we conduct big business, raw is how we live this
Give this, thats how we conduct big business

Verse 2: (Shyhiem)

I ride shotgun in Cappa's Black ML Four-Twenty
Benz Jeep with big boy heat, a Thirty-Thirty
Shotgun, pull it out and show you what a thug about
Ya'll niggas is pussy, thats why ya'll get atein' out
Niggas hate me now 'cause I be so jig my A.K.A. oughta be Shawn Carter
My heart bigger than my ego, eho
I put my heart on the line and hit both free throws
Yeah, build with a parole hole
Guzzle the old Gold with no bag, on the bliddock
Holdin' the gliddock, you can't fuck with this shit ock
Locks it down like JT from the mothafuckin' liddot
S is for my Sons, H I'm not havin' it 'cause I'm not the one
A is for the ammo that I keep for my gidd-uns
B is for the blood, bandanas, and the bidd-uns
C is for the crips, comrads, and the Kenyon
We a-alike, b-alike, so we see alike
I roll with niggas that stay in jail like Iron Mike
I get hype, and keep it gully, interrupt commercial shit

Chorus

Verse 3: (Cappadonna)

God, keep shinin' your light, I got a calling
Felt like the Angels were fallin'
But with this God given mic I restored the faith
My love for the prophets keeps me safe
See, I don't have to worry 'cause I know God is great
If it wasn't for the Father it wouldn't be a Bill Gates
No Bill Clinton, no United States
Peep it, explore my mind like a secret
If the music ain't good, ya'll won't leak it
So I give thanks and praise to the almighty
The spirit in the music hit ya'll lightly
Motown Hip-Hop, don't try to fight me
I call on the arch angel, cast out the hate
All-time Cappacino the great
A role model like Treach and Pepa
Double L, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett
The way I think it, my songs speak to you
You better stay focused and the beast won't eat you

Chorus




Ahh... the outdoors, the fresh outdoors
Word up, it's a beautiful day
Bout to go poli' right now that's my word
Aiyyo


Aiyyo call me a cab it's the Razor Sharp kid
Dipped everyday my style is po-lit'
I'm out to the Mansion I gots to catch Ghost
I'm headed to the club tonight, we need toast
For that wack ass MC, talking all the shit
I know we can't wait just to get his wig split
It's war with the Gods this year, represent
The bitch-ass niggas keep trying to repent
But we still licking off, we wild like 2 Cent
Park Hill Projects, say it with your lungs
Fuck y'all cats, we always got guns
But just in case, we get drunk and can't drive
We gotta fuck something up
Dead or alive y'all coming with us
We live on the other side of the chart
Where your mother met Poppa Wu


Black boy, in the ghetto streets
Black boy, no more suffering
Black boy, shine the light for we
Continue, black boy, black boy, black boy, black boy


After the tour I came back for more
Coming correctly, just like before
Wu-Tang Forever, I was just a pirate
In the rec room regulating with Osirus
Deep thoughts, I don't take no shorts
Minds on lease like expensive imports
Elevate the seed, no lust or greed
Living life long time may continue to breed
Never getting caught up inside the agencies
For ten long years, but I paid my fee
Now I'm on the frontline with W.T.C
Back me down these streets are still ill
From Brownsville all the way down in Park Hill
Pack with the beef cause niggas won't chill
Cats smoked out like chicken on the grill
I'm taking this shit way back to Bill Bill
In the projects where my man got killed


Black boy, in the ghetto streets
Black boy, no more suffering
Black boy, shine the light for we
Continue, black boy, black boy, black boy, black boy


Donna Camay, rocking with y'all all night
Used to be a little stressed now I'm getting it right
Fresh kicks with the gold watch dipped in ice
From Shaolin, it's the vanglorious man
When the world go around these things start to happen
Wifey in the kitchen, brother still snitching
Bloods accumulating, we getting impatient
Knowledge and Wisdom, teach the understanding
That's how I'm planning, blow up like a cannon
Pull my man in, hit y'all again
Now I make sense, we do this for the rent
Build with intelligence break your defense
No hesitation, time gets spent
Some fall victim, others get bent
Some recognize, real niggas represent
I can't never stop til my heart is content
Putting in the work til I feel confidant
Blast out darts in the Wu basement

 (x2)
Black boy, in the ghetto streets
Black boy, no more suffering
Black boy, shine the light for we
Continue, black boy, black boy, black boy, black boy


Hahahahahahahaha
Don't you know the underworld?
There's no friendship party here
No meeting
You can come, but you can't leave
Move! Let no one live..
*sounds of fighting*

*sounds of fighting*






Where's my horns? Andale! Andale! Yo


Throw me in a mosh pit, I'm live, will start shit
Melt the place then break out like an arsonist
Classified to get it for a classic killing
If I turn my back and walk, that means I'm chilling
Got bitches in mi casa, boiling fresh lobsters
But I don't do the shellfish, I'mma just eat pasta
Turkey, Italian sausage, chopped up kielbasa
Doing hits from home, like an elite mobster
Love my onions iced up, real little, wifed up
Gotti trench men is real brittle, Poconos is where I go with the capos
Eleven Sammy the Bulls, ready to wake those
I'm half black, yo, half oregano
That's half Ital', yo, who he, I'm from that Island, yo
Staten, crushing niggas like aspirins
Commissioner Kelly, ya'll kill ya captain
That's word to my bitch that's laid off
That little patch in the pussy, word, I ate it off
Team move with hands in the air like Adolf
Hand me a big joint, bet I spray it off


Toma, toma, mira, big kid
Poppy Wardrobe, Poppy Wardrobe, right here, Poppy Wardrobe!
Maricon! Yeah...


La Cosa Nostra, La Familia
What, violate my family ties and I'mma kill ya'll
Mi amor, dami un beso, El Capitan, I'm ghettio
Hot sauce, on my Spaghetti-O's
Poppy Wardrobe, Mexican, handle a hose
All my gutter gang crew, got border patrol
Lights on when I come through, black Soprano, what
Two in the holster, my code name Darryl
Ride off in the sunset, sparking the barrel
Long boots on, my horse named White Boy John
Ride that side of that bitch, straight Mexican song
Ash hanging off the blunt, don't ever look at me wrong
In my heart piece stolen, Julio, I'm dirty
Up in the Arizona desert, where the shit get ugly
All my Staten Island riders, ride or die honchos
Get CREAM all day, leave our poncho
We bull fighting niggas, wrestle with broncos
And my team stay tight like Silver and Tonto
Carry a long whip, ya'll whip ya ass
Hard head Mexican dope, mixed with hash
Machete behind dough, with a rip in the slash
Desperado kids, me and Ghost, back at last


Toma, toma, Poppy Wardrobe
Poppy Wardrobe, Poppy Wardrobe
Bring it...


Yeah, Cinqo de Mayo, imported guns from Cairo
Got bagged with the toaster, beat the charge like rhinos
This bitch who's Albino, I met her out in Chi-Town
While I was out in Greek town, ordering gyros
The bad bitch keep a tool and a bible, quick to murder her rivals
And her pops was a gangsta disciple
He killed about a thousand vice lords, guns and knife wars
The feds came for him, so slick to the night ward
Down in the N.O., and right before he left
He wrote his daughter a memo, left stacks in the Benzo
It got hot, niggas selling, giving out the info
He paranoid, every 20 seconds out the window
Blow it in the limbo, he spazzed on Lorenzo
And smashed him in the head with his own son's Nintendo
About a week later, the boys came and rushed him
Kicked down his door, while he sleeping and cuffed him








Let's take it back to the blacktop
Mags on le Donna
When the boom box hittin' bong
I play your position
Know the ledge got some juice now
40 ounce get loose now
Holler at some crazies
That believes the other crew's sound stealing
Gold chillin heads up to the ceilin'
Constantly revealin' hip hop Will ya stealin'
Through the veins and the buzz stream the goat scream
Enough cream gunnin' 
For a million, keep 'em comin
Back for more, reservoir dog raw
With the raw bagged up under the floorboards
Pure uncut dope, unmarked bills
Bad gold cables and the  grills
Drop top Mercedes with the shiny chrome rims
See hip hop was even bling bling back then
Don't think for one point materialism's new
Just because you ain't acknowledge the old school
True I'm livin' understand every   a livin'
Gave birth to a wizard, 
On a mission goin day by day
While we hood I'm God playin' , play by play

Now pray



{Pull out your money
Pull out your cut
Money, bitches, cars, clothes and weed
(Money, money)
Even if I fail I land on a bunch of money}




{Pull out your money
Pull out your cut
Money, bitches, cars, clothes and weed
(Money, money)
Even if I fail I land on a bunch of money}


Guns and drugs and thugs hold it down in the slums
Smuggling crumbs, dope fiend bodies is numb
We might beat you it's stolen, we don't know where you're from
Got goons all around yeah, like over a 100
Sober and blunted, running now, soldiers is cunning
Moody was stubborn, even pull a tool on each other
Lay your house flat, leave with your cheese from your mousetrap
Then ride out back to the hideout where we count stacks
Papered up, fresh out the barber shop, tapered up
Hoes used to front on 'em but now they all vapoured up
Cake is us, this is good cush, take a puff
Must I remind you need a grinder just to break it up
Back to the murder plot, heard he got robbed
And flossers lied same night you heard he got got
A boss he was not, cross me and it's off with your top
Rock you with cops and trespassing and locking your blocks




My world winning lifestyle, never smile much
Nothing personal it's how we grew up
Ghetto life, city lights, corner hustlers who trying to escape it
Street violence where the weak won't make it
Recognizing life is real and currency is needed
But it gets taken if you can't defend it
Early manhood fast lane, slinging cocaine to make your ends meet
Mother weak younger song laying in the streets
Beat the murder charge acquitted
Bounce to the next state where they're rockin, bank stoppin everything
Heard him singing, contract on his head
Like Tommy Wink for real




Whether I'm rich or poor, I'ma still want more
I've been tryna maintain but I'm still hardcore
I be in the streets all day, 4 in the morning
See these all the time, I'm ignoring the warning
I'm a hustle hard nigga, you can hear my holler
Used to be into madness, yeah I came from under
I'm a project zero nights and all that fly shit
Plus I get it free, I ain't always gotta buy it
Fuck y'all niggas ya don't even gotta try it
I'm Mountain  AC, I feel like I'm retired
I'm a family man now and now I'm the wisest
I don't play no games, I keep my eye on the misers
Little children take notice, little niggas take note
Real niggas get paid but never end up in state clothes




There are no words to describe what I see with my eyes
They brains are fried, they just be believing the lies
They locked up inside the law, always talkin' bout they hardcore
Nigga you ain't even inside cyber secure
Til I bust down your door with a 44 inch chainsaw
Force your jaw, pitch like a claymore
I don't give a fat rat's ass about the price of that gas
I'm already strapped for cash
Lake Placid swamp gator habitat
Canibus Brad Pitt World War Z bugout bag kiss
Capricorn Asian pass
M-Eighty in the Situation Room talking to the top brass
50 magnification
100 millimeters looking at the space stations workin' out the equations
Sinkhole black hole bubblin' Cajun, tough as the raven
My jumbo gumbo gumbo taste it
Nothing can save him, face it, you suckers wasted
Soldiers sold, now you havin' trouble with the payments
La lay loo lay lo with Lupe's laces
Ain't no little geegaws uncreate my creations
That's why I keep pace with energies beyond my displacement
Hoping to give faith to the faithless
20 gold shillings with the illest of the Almighty siblings
In the village organizing the pillage, niggas



* Cappa repeats "Blood Brothers" throughout the song


Blood Brothers (SUUUUUUU!!!!!)


All y'all hatin' ass MC's Run 4 Cover
Long live Cappadon' that's word to mother
I'm a Staten Island slike nigga straight from the gutters
And every time you see me, I always got the butters
And the fat chick on the low, ready to flow
I carry guns, cracks, ounces of blow
Travel across the globe, show after show
We fuckin' ho's all night, that's the goal
And there's a bunch of y'all niggas that's feelin' the O
But do I give a shit about y'all? I don't think so
I clap one of y'all niggas and leave you flat
And the rest of y'all bitch ass niggas'll fall back
It's the C-to the A-P in ya mouth
Cold stab y'all niggas, what the fuck y'all talkin' about?




Homicide Hills, Staten Island
That's what it is


Aiyo Cap what you speak about? Niggas still frontin'
Like we ain't got shit to make a cat start runnin'
What? We blood for life, we thug for life
Y'all remember in the crib when we bugged at night?
Mama Love always screamed on us
And sometimes, not all the time, Daddy dropped CREAM on us
Motherfuckers wan' get it gully back to back
Take it back to eighty-six when we wrapped up crack
And we ride together, rhyme together
Eat together, talk shit and sleep together
In the Hood we pack eat together
What you think? Y'all niggas keep frontin' I'ma bleed ya leather
L-O be blunt, speak twice, speak it up
How you feel about fam dogs sneakin' up?




What's wrong with y'all? I'ma sing a song for y'all
Pop off 'til I get along with y'all
I'ma stay strong with y'all
Knucklehead niggas, Shaolin volume two
Stuck the stacked knives, bigger than pistol
Pop the pistol at the police that's disturbin' the peace
Hard times on the block, guns and hair grease
I'm just tryin' to eat, nigga, and stack cheddar
I don't think I'm better, I'm just a true blue nigga
But the hood is redder
Kid the way I do things is my only vendetta
Original Don Don, and jelly green Nike's on kid the green leather
I ain't sweatin' shit for bringin' fam dogs together
And my big dick go right in ya heffer





Yo, break that dutch down



You and your man, y'all fucked up for real
Now we got to show y'all niggas the deal
I sling raps, like cracks on the street
Attack, riot, rise above
Smash y'all, trash y'all, show y'all love
Thoughts are bright like a lightbulb
Ice cold raps, you stroll
Lease a finance, one chance, be my CD entity
Your energy is too low to bite my slug
You get drug behind bars and death is stoled on
Your code too simple, you best to hold on
Meet number three slang auxilary, and slang therapy
Based upon a true story, throw darts
Cut markers, straight duplicators, it's the terminator, Wu Killa Bee
Understanding, old special ed with the plate in my head
Bad bread, spare life, KKK on the mike, power like thing of state
What, play with the pussy and fuck
Stuck with the poles forever, what
Wu-Tang Forever, never sleep
Lyrics that kill, murder one voice
Chill or get dropped, your weak team ain't appropriate to no lessons
Adolescence, rhyme war, encore, surrender to my rap, I'm stuck on the map
Like I told you before winter war, in these days of hardcore
Smoke never stop clearing, stop cheering, you making me hot
Acid rain, a capell, wet you
And upset you, get you death threat, on cassette, it's the project
Reject, with the mic check
Set to be the son that set the place off
Face off, my darts is loving you, cyanide made your piss smell like flouride
Heavy stride, see it from the outside, archive five, smoke blunts hard



Blood on blood war, take your mind on tour, stand tall like the Berlin Wall
Automatic darts are pulled
Stand for, never ignore the silence and violence
We live for a blood on blood war
Blood on blood war, take your mind on tour, stand tall like the Berlin Wall
Automatic darts are pulled
Stand for, never ignore the blood on blood war
Uncut raw we live for



All I need, is ten big bags of weed
Twenty-four acres of land so I could breathe
Money like Dusty, Prize like Leon, throw darts at you if the heat's ever on
Split you with the .45 caliber rap
Beat y'all down with shit that sound fat
Call 911, you still can't score
You and your dulla ain't prepared for the war
Yeah, you got heat but we got C4
Plus we got buildings that's watching your door
Hunchback, Chi-kids, Brother Jihad
VGL, FMF, the Bam Squad
Terrorize y'all from every direction
Call up Hot 97 for protection
Cappadonna, from the Wu-Tang Clan
Spotted last night in the all black van
Coming down the block with guns out the windows
Licking shots off every time a wind blow
My class come first, I'm first to represent
Killa Bees linger in the air like incense
Instant action, speed of a satellite, insight
Sight snakes from afar
Ajar, one side of a 2 faced bar
Project star, CD hackers
Supreme rapper, with the baseball cap
I attack fatal on the track



Blood on blood war, take your mind on tour, stand tall like the Berlin Wall
Automatic darts are pulled
Stand for, never ignore the silence and violence
That we live for a blood on blood war
Blood on blood war, take your mind on tour, stand tall like the Berlin Wall
Automatic darts are pulled
Stand for, never ignore the blood on blood war
Uncut raw we live for
Yeah

*6 gunshots, then the dropping of shells in the background*




I was born in New York City, September 18th
In a Jewish hospital in Brooklyn, my body was clean
I was known as a bastard child, and my pop left early
Muthafucka, I ain't know his style
I was raised by my step-dad, that's my father
A good married man, plus kept a revolver
Taught me not to hit ladies out, I don't really need 'em
Never trust 'em hoes, know how to read them
And my step-father split, I was out on my own
I was only 17, but I thought I was grown
I sold crack before I got my hands on the chrome
At the same time, I had chicks giving me dome
My girl claiming she virgin, not wanting to bone
I did a one-to-three for cracks, and I came back home
Seeded my girl up, but I was still on the roam
I was out in Body Brighton, straight marking holmes
Me and my nigga RSC, that's my doolah debt brother
We held each other down, watch out for undercovers
Eight months later, got knocked again
Praying the lord lift me up, I got dropped again
Cops took my crack money, stopped again
Then they put me in the cell, and they locked me in
My good girl turned savage, and she whopped my friend
I did the bid, came down on work release
Cut my girlfriend off, start working the streets
Hustlin', doing whatever so my seed could eat
My girl didn't get along, we always had beef
Me and my seed relationship started to get weak
Rapping at the same time, started to get deep
My life got crazier, then I out stand it
A year and a half later, my crib is surrounded
I slipped off lovely, now I'm up in the Bronx
One the Grand Concourse, that's up in New York
Police scaring my mother, and they was calling the fort
Harassing my peoples, cuz they want me in court
So I turned myself in, they staight sent me to Sing-Sing
I ain't new to this shit, though, I be doing my thing-thing
So I did my violation, kid, nine in the mohawk
Where niggas cut niggas and them dogs show off
I bugged out for a minute, they put me in the box
Kid, I did my time in jail, I carried my ox
Never fronting where I come from, I carried my block
Now I'm back on the set, and my darts is hot
Same time my Wu-Tang niggas started to pop
I was battling these MC's, way before that joint called Ice Cream
Land, and you couldn't understand, how I claim my spot
Razor Sharp Records signed me up, straight off cop
I was shooting videos now and mixing the drinks
Me and my dogs Rae & Ghost dropped a joint called Cuban Linx
Mad groupie love, minage's and minks
On the down low, my rep started to get bigger
Everybody that didn't know me was like "whose that nigga?"
Next thing you know, here comes The Pillage
Hit you in the head, ramsack ya village
Way before you rappers, turned into killers
The Five Percent Nation had the game on Knowledge of Self
To showin' all of ya niggas how to get the dollars for delf
A lot of ya'll smart niggas went to college for health
But I'm ghetto all of my life, my cards were dealt
Might slump you over my paper, fuck the belt
I'mma keep spittin' my darts, til my words are felt
Poppy Wardrobe King, ya'll ain't know how to dress
I told ya'll in Winter Warz, I was Staten Island's best
Never told you the story though, I was taking a rest
How I started blowing up, niggas getting upset
Yo, I'm known as Original, in my projects
I'm known as Cappadonna, in my projects
And I'm try'nna write something, my readers could digest
The Yin & Yang came different, I began to fall
Problems with my click, it's no longer all for all
Me and my Baltimore niggas, ready to brawl
So we slipped up in the gate, like Taj Mahal
The Clan was on the stage, they was holding the ball
Then Ghost gave me the mic, my verse got avoided
Me, Dust Dap' and Ed, was paranoided
The money might of made it, but the money destroyed it
The rumors circled how the Clan, they dissed Summer Jam
Rose up against the system, we all got banned
Some of the lost generation don't know who I am
I'm on that Theodore shit, like I told you I can
From crack sales to grams, the guns, the fams
Weeds, the ecst' pills, plus crushin' the fans
I see where them idiots be tuckin' they hands
That's why I'm always on the grind, never ducking my plans



Intro: Cappadonna
This is the bread of life man
The bread of life
Cus I'm gonna feed all of y'all
I'm gonna feed all of y'all with intelligent lifespans man
I'm gonna give y'all vocubulary veggies
Word up and make y'all understand that
Now is the time to come amongst this nation
And end all devilishment

2nd Intro: Cappadonna
You don't really want god in your life
You don't really want god in your life

Hook: Cappadonna
The bread of life
Drop jewels and take flight
In this royal army I'm gonna stand and fight
X3

Verse 1: Neonek
Pour my wars out basins
My gates is filled with live grazes
Live and die for the king
Escaping hells faces
Forces with chariots armed
Dark horses
God will make God ????? and face loses
Seven months to bury the dead
The lord said
Make a feast for the birds and bees to eat flesh
Shouldn't turn the man you are
Consume you in your darkness
Bloodbaths sealed with fire the lords wrath
Man fainted
Now they see the glory God painted
Heavens army made a statement on your anti-Christ arrangement
Swinging the sword against God
And every mountain
Unleash a vile plague on all you heathens who be doubting
Lined up
Split you in half and grind up
I lined up split you in half and grind up
Enemies are the most high dined hired up
When your times up
The lord made his mind up
Everlasting torment for all you snakes who played foremen

Verse 2: Cappadonna
I got pains in my stomach
I just need to eat
I can't take it no more it's like life in the street
Got my hands shaking
Stressed out for cess
This rap is like coke
My mother can't rest
Times is hard
GATS in the projects
Niggas got jealous since my LP
Made life better
Now y'all hate me
Putting my life down for G-O-D
I rock this
Only love can top this
Laced in clean spirits
Now I'm spotless
Pulling out nots
Now I make hits
Throw jewels at you
Reap the benefits
Laid back love eat my tuna fish
Like that y'all
My God'll slap y'all
Devils in the place
Angels'll trap y'all

Hook: Cappadonna
The bread of life
Drop jewels and take flight
In this royal army I'm gonna stand and fight
X3

Verse 3: Killah Priest
As the full moon follow my passage
Enter my tomb now strike the matches
Light up the room
Open my caskets
Theres my Mummy
Covered in maggotts
Say the words bring me back like Lazarus
Came to pass like the old lady who read my tarrots
My GAT spit
Still I shed the tears of a saint
My hearts passion
Painting pictures that's mad graphic
After my words are said
My paper burns up in ashes
All my thugs surround me like Christ at the last supper
Cold winds beat upon the window shutters
We break bread
8 Fed's came in and bust us
They rush us
They took me I screamed to my dog
The Sun Of Man must suffer
They kill me
Another one will rise from the gutter motherfuckers

Hook: Cappadonna
The bread of life(You don't really want God in your life)
Drop jewels and take flight
In this royal army I'm gonna stand and fight
X2

Verse 4: Cappadonna
We always in the struggle
Making those Wu-Banga's
We hang like hangers
It's the essence of hip-hop
Live in the present
Write rhymes or Hasson'll never test this
Eighties fundamental
God is essential
Rents due plus the greatest lesson is don't owe
Pray with the flow and cruise through the avenue
Blacked down like some of the Jews do
Guns kill so do a missle
All praise due
May the father be with you
A child need milk
These needles are specially built to open your mind
Now is the time oh Lord place your hands upon us
It's the meat by selling bricks
To building cocaine weak
People don't speak where it's rats and 'roaches
Cats and dogs
Cops roll like Bozz Hogg
In the jungle
Where every black man is Tarzan
We are gathered here today
In the name of this rap
We coming in peace
So nobody have to get clapped

Hook: Cappadonna
The bread of life
Drop jewels and take flight
In this royal army I'm gonna stand and fight
X7

Outro: Cappadonna
You don't really want God in your life
The bread of life
You don't really want God in your life




Shake 'em... post up.. (move... yeah)
Hold that nigga..


It's like a snake bites the flesh, I damage and leave the poison
Ruckus in the Square, it's me who brought the noise in
The vocab killa, usin' my words like matches
Settin' fire to the jam like Backdraft & Hellfire
Latches, start to unlock when I rock
You with the ready rock, hip hop feels the block
You can't stop, bouncin' and movin'
Cuz I walk these dogs like I'm righteous
Buildin' in the cypher with twelve Gods
People from all over flood the street like cars
To hear the drama, who's that spectucular rhymer?
It's me: C-A-P-P-A, D, double E
Cappadon' brings the shit from cross the sea
With the laid back style that pump inside the Porsche
If this was the Olympics, I be holdin' the torch
With the phat golden 'dallion hangin' down from my neck
We the slang prostitution get the dookie respect


Yeah, talkin' bout, get that money up
Birth of Don'... what up Rae? What up Ghost?
Look at this..


I'm a lyrical arson, my technique is awesome
Verbal murderer darts and suttle the beat metamorphis
Step into my office, I torch this, for chips I cost this
More hits, no water hits, unrecord this
I swing a sword quick, original Don' for hire
I attack microphones and set 'em on fire
Welcome to my environment of ill vocal attire
Pass the wire, it's the twelve o'clock rock
That makes the hip hop beats, dart armanilla
Straight Killa Hilla, ol' school joints and Miller
Baggy jeans, the gun-gums vest in the dumb-dumbs
Come on my team pick corns and we rump-a-pump-pump
Coins, and we dumb-dumbs be Donna Goines and my niggas
No feds, easy on the pictures (come on now)
Watch everything and search those bitches


See you, word up
We don't get no prop-love
Rump-a-pump-pump-pump
Come on, can I say it?
Pass the tape, get the fuck up
What, what, Homicide, S.I
What, baby? The hustle... come on
Surrender! Move, haha, grab 'em, what's really good?
You fuckin' faggots!
I tried to tell ya niggas, we won't be opressed no more..
We ain't takin' it, nigga, this shit is real!
This album right here is called "The Struggle"
Don't forget! It's my fuckin' word..
2003, slash, Code:Red, nigga! *three gun shots*




Yup, you got the juice now, man


Niggas respect mine (brothers respect mine, brothers respect mien)
Respect mine (brothers respect mine)


Yo, I be, out here, in these streets
While you be, in the bed, under the sheets
I grind hard, regardless, I'm gon' eat
I don't care how many niggas you roll with or how deep
Cuz I say one word, now you fast asleep
I rebute rappers, that spread poison
I come in the meet for him, speak words that make born
You in my brainstorm, I sting men that do the innocent wrong
Your sentiments, you imagining vain things
Neglecting me, but I reign king, savagy and wankstas
Is not a part of my main stream, they plain jeans
I'm King Original, Tao Wu Tazine
Solomon darts, vocabulary Nazarines
Come with a sharp sword, I'm justified by all means, back up from my altar
Falsehood niggas become falser
I came back, and stepped out of the sourcer
Respect mines, make me an offer
Or face the 36 Chambers of Torture

"Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, brothers respect mine" - Raekwon sample scratched up


The General, Rebel the great, I'm on money like the president face
Next felony's a federal case
New blood, you can never relate
True blood, you can never debate, not in nueve tres
I spit like a deagle with the speed low
Hustle hard, gamble on the game like Pete Rose
Respect mine, steppin' with the G code
Make a nigga move like cops through the peephole
Manifesto, light it like a techno club
Outside and don't expect no love
Rolling like a west coast thug til the wheels fall off
And I be damned if you step on cuz
Brohters respect vets, son is a vet
Henny rap, feel it up on your chest
Green eyes try and smuggle my rep, so upset but you love it to death
Get it in, shits, nothing to Deck, he set

"Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, brothers respect mine" - Raekwon sample scratched up


For respect, I empty shots out of this tech
Catch homey at the light, drag him out of his Lex'
On the edge like Q on the ledge, you got the Juice now
I took a pledge to the streets, since it was goosed down
Police move foul, I can move the crowd
Freestyle or bang bang, any rapper shoot him down
Pull the ruger out, from the Hill to the Harbor
Bloomingdale Road, Goonberg, stupid clout
Old school money, get it from my grandad
So I use a nigga face like I punch a sandbag
Ran fats when the van passed
My pants sag, scuffs on my Air Max, blood on my man's rag
Got the homey loc'ing, I'm still Wolfpacking
Looking like Kobe open, just passing
Two 4, numbers I rep
So my hunger for this bread probably hustle to death, yeah

"Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, brothers respect mine" - Raekwon sample scratched up




Who I'm is? The Phenom, them niggas can't live
Who I'm is? We ain't got shit, something got to give
Y'all done flipped y'all wig, blacked out the crib
Die and live for my nigs and my bad-ass kids, freeze
Looking at your ice like Jeez!
I'm plotting on the mousetrap, about to snatch the cheese
I heard y'all kids is bout that, psychotherapy
You bugging where the couch at, Wu til they bury me
Never tell a lie, like George with the cherry tree
Now it's cherry pie, if it's not broke let it be
Ain't nothing nice in New York
Stick you for your cake and your icing, that tough talk
Don't mean nothing when you're up North
So keep them hands where I can see 'em like you want freedom
You know that saying if you can't join 'em, beat 'em, and push your way in
We ain't acrobats but we flip on occasion
Pick the pace up, pants sagging pull your waist up
Niggas renting slum jewels from Jacob, fool!
You're like "Dude! I don't like your fucking attitude"
Fronting on my Clan from the Stat but we ain't mad at you


Starks with the parcheesi face, measly paced ofays Ghostface
Jump out the window for a little taste
The joopy look, my main bitches call me lazy
Educated birds say, "Ghost you so crazy!"


Cappa slide through with the Ghost
Post up like paint on walls
Drip jewels, big heat
Ruffle inside the bubble goose, it's the Odd Couple
Hollow points follow you home to Staten Island
Playing with the big toys that make noise
Echo in the hall, a scared voice
Niggas start to act choice, but Duncan Hines
Didn't know Betty Crocker had the two nines
Made the club moist, shattered the windows
Dustheads running
The rap kingpin plus the Black Jesus is coming


The words you talk better be the words you walk
Body you in the bed where the nurses are
Put your vein out, watch me insert the dart
Til it plagues from Bricks to the Persian Gulf
Light circuits off, thirty-third of my brain is off
That explains why my language off
My gun aim and cough, y'all ain't trained to brawl
Y'all more like in training bras
Wet behind the ear, you're not prepared
For the project flow, with extra stairs
I pass out a vest to wear (bullets flyin)
Yo, the hard wire, starting bonfires
Pull the mask so you know it's me
And your weed got more seeds than ODB
Can't smoke with ya, watch Ghost tie a rope to ya
Def and Wu will open ya


Eat a dick like (huh) baby shake your shit
Girl you're thick like (huh) getting rich like (huh)


Word, it's me y'all
We in two sixes flirting with bitches, dime plus
Taking pictures, How you doing baby? My name Ghost
Don't get caught up in my chains or the way that I speak
Seek intelligence, slickest nigga going since "Grease"
Check out the grays on the side of my waves
I grew those on Rikers Island
Stressed out, balled up in the cage
Pull a boot out on Jimmy Jam, text takes jam
Silky texture, Jordan jumped up like Clyde Drexler
All up in the parrot, nose numb, real as they come
Biggie's Versaces, snow white rabbit
Hands is like photographic magic
Funeral love, move in when we hug, don't make it a habit
Hit the gym for two weeks, my back all chiseled
Elbows unique now meet the new me
Ghetto fabulous, Tone Atlas
Zulu Nation in the 80's in front of Macy's I start my own chapters
Tyco Nite-Glow velvet pose, special effects
High-tech armors merc you at the shows
Supercalifragalisticexpialidocious
Dociousaliexpifragalisticcalisuper
Cancun, catch me in the room, eating grouper


Shoe fly shoe, Wally Don Clark crew
Fuck y'all wanna do, crack a brew, smoke an L or two
And flip like (huh) killing for the whole
Clique is sick like (huh) you and your stank bitch
Eat a dick like (huh) baby shake your shit
Girl you're thick like (huh) getting rich like (huh)




"You fucked me?"
	"I did not!"
"Yeah you did. You went behind my back, you cut me, you fucked me."
	"Me?  Nah.. never!
	 What the hell.. maybe you're right
	 Maybe I did betray you a little bit"


Time to ride out... yeah...
All the way ride out...


You can be the biggest bully you want
You can think you as hard as you is
But there ain't nothing in this world
To convince, you snitching, who you claim you is


Mr. Boulevard, see Murda Mob Gang
West Brighton murder capital, non identical
Wild like Hiroshima, with a bomb, taped to my gut
In a terminal, project guillotine, fired like Heat from the beam'll
Scorch ya bitch ass like the oil, from the prontono plants
Shit I became a long way since '74 suicide watch
Millennium mixtape, alpha and omega
On the block pushing diesel and the crack together
Momma could feed the general, crying over papa's war letters
Old timers look at my soul, say that it'll raise the hurricane
Gun hostler very wing, only time you smell the powder burning
Is when the ratchet empty, either you with me or against me




Fuck rap, this for them 25 to lifers
Added to hot pot cookers, produced by the madness
Spit enough ammo to conjugate a death list
Lines of torture, M.C.'s
Like being tied down, guzzling goat piss
Made movie, it should of been box office smashes
Equipped with sparks, like books of matches
Officer and a Gentleman Part 2
In soldier colors, red fatigue
Wipe the blade clean, with black tee's
I'm here for whoever holding the crown
Understand me, I pop something
I'm so glorified, and don't mistake me for G-Unit
But them semi's I spit at your unit
I blow the head off your Voltron, fuck ya average song




I set flame to your wiz, put the game all over your kids
Know what it is, Verrazano Bridge music
The third coming of the lost and found
Ever since the fall of the Roman Empire
Me and Solomon Childs been holding it down
Beat the bully out ya'll, you a thug in a gown
You ain't shooting at me, you put your slugs in the ground
And I'm all the way hot with it, and you not with it
You got fitted for your lifestyle, you the last decade shit
We right now, Don Diggler, my bear's in the background
Staten Island for real, ya'll fake niggas think ya'll real
Kick doors down, take my reel
Greedy ass niggas, sittin' on Benz wheels, I put snakes on 'em
High stakes on 'em (crack crates on 'em)
Bully start running when the planet of the apes on 'em






Don't get it twisted
Just came to shed
A little light on things
'cuz it's like y'all be forgettin'
I don't really
Be havin' too much to say


I was lovin' you before
But girl now you know
I'm callin' it quits


You told me you was goin' to stay over your mother's house
But my niggas on the block said you at Mike brother's house
I came back from off tour stains was on my livin' room couch
You was lookin' at me like you ain't know what the fuck
I was talkin' about, yup
You was once in my life but you gon' soon to be out
See ya
I don't give a fuck about you bitch
Go ahead tune me out




You said you was goin' over Gina's house to get your hair did
But you was really sneakin' round on me and fuckin' that other kid
You said you live in Brooklyn but that's not really where you live
I followed you to Queens
You came outta somebody else crib




You used to be my down bitch
Now you just a clown bitch
You ain't nothin' but a slut
That's why I hardly come around bitch
I was amazed over the ill shit I heard that you did
My niggas pulled the train on you broke your little ribs
'Don and my dogs, hate honeys that's the game
That pussy was never mine
It don't even feel the same
We was never goin' nowhere
Our life were based upon lies
And you didn't really love me
You was lovin' my dick size






You know how we do!


Yo, what's the deal Goldilocks?
Ain't nothing I'm just hibernating, love that watch
Pour me some Scotch and cold Courvoisier
No doubt, have a chair Boo lets get to pollying
Who you with? Me and Molly and some trick who's Yugoslavian
What fabric is that? It's only wool and Rayon
Lipstick crayon, fly Fahrenheit spray on
I'm getting tipsy, I hope she read cocks like a gypsy
And transporting bricks stealing many fifties
Fuck negotiating, is you with me is you waiting
Sweet as carrot cake, faking plus you don't eat turkey bacon
I don't get down like that, I don't get down neither
Cuban links skeezer, why you acting like a rap teaser
I'm like the jewelry exchange plus a range
Nigga you small change I only fuck for figaro chains
Analyzing Miss Clairol, Fendi down, mascara on
Assistant manager in Paragon


Socializing, vibing with my eyes on Dot
She this book cover lady that be blowing up the spot
While my heart was racing, like the hands on the clock
I step live I think she see me putting out the pot
Peace Dot, I'm so happy to see you at the rendezvous
How's life today your hands are softer than Camay too
Your hairdo way more class than Halle Berry
Caught visions of me and you riding on the ferry
Plus your daughter Kiki talk to my man Merry
I order me a Sex on the Beach with the cherry
I order her a Vermidi on ice, sounds nice
She elegant, pretty eyes, glasses, intelligent
Whispered in my ear that she's celibate
Whispered back to her ear we don't have to go there
As I grab the hand set her politely in the chair
As we stopped to stare at one another
Black sister to brother
I'm thinking all the time how she could be my lover


What's happening brown sugar? Say you look so good today
Ankle bracelet wrapped around your leg
Here have a seat, complimentary drinks is on me
Bartender, Chevalier Chateau at table three
Luxurious rings, eyes sparkling
What's your name sugar? Juanita Cash Hawkins
Your complexion gives a reflection of
Sometime a black woman just need to be loved
Quiet and shy, baby girl my gift got you high
Made you wanna hit me with the keys to that five?
Just joking baby, I have a sharp sense of humour
Wish I would've bumped into your frame a lot sooner
What's your physical degree, thirty one, thirty three
Half Hawaiian with a slight touch of Chinese
Seen you working at a law firm, on Fifth Avenue
Three blocks from the Gucci spot is where I trapped you
Yo, I'm all into older woman, who's happy living
Love kids and, keep all our business in the crib and
And not afraid to die with me the God on your side
We holding hands til death do us apart and then we slide
Earring in the left side of your nose love my combo
Should have left my Wis' a thousand times maybe tonight though
Yo you sexy motherfucker, damn what's the recipe?
You make a nigga wanna god damn!
Can you cook darling? At the stove you're evolving
Baked macaroni, turkey wings, a nigga starving
Here take my number let me pull the chair from under
I had fun plus your backyard speak with thunder




Today I'll talk about kindness
Justice, faith, and kindness
I want you to listen carefully
Kindness and faith, are the foundation
Without them, we can't become good people
And with justice, we know we can lead a good life
And how can I be a good man then, eh?
Huh... well, first of all, you have to practice honesty
Mmm?
Keep your temper, never lose control of yourself
Keep control
Be patient, if you learn to do these things, you can master anything


Out of nowhere, there came a caravan
This was around a campfire light
A lovely woman in motion
Her hair was as dark, as the night


Cruisin on the interstate, just follow while I innovate
Too many try and imitate, medallion like a dinner plate
Front and get your dinner ate, chinchilla for the winter, wait
I'm tryin to bring the "Sexy Back" like Timbaland and Timberlake
Spittin like a calico, kush from a Cali ho
Tell that joker "tally ho", put shots in that Denali yo
RZA you know how we go on them 20's, that's how we roll
And I don't eat berries but eat a Berry like Halle though
The game criminal, my, my chain figaro
My, my dame's pigeon-toed, I'm still the same nigga though
Uh, kid rock a fitted low, still got a wicked flow
And I'm like Barry Bonds on anything that RZA throw


On anything that RZA throw, Ironman's invisible
I left my chick for cheatin on me, now that bitch is miserable
Poppin bottles, paintin hella Wallo's on my physical
We gon' have a ball, might as well pick a testicle
Purple haze festivals, smoke a nigga like a bowl
Fuck a coma, now the state you layin is a vegetable
You wanna see me? Like you ain't checkable?
You like a CD, I burn you and I wrecked a few...




Only God, has lept into avenged mind
And can distinguish, good, from evil
Ha ha ha ha

 Aye Yo Cappa!!


We gotta get more cake together, so we could branch out
Preserve land, get a boat and a ranch house
Call me a dreamer, but I hustle for real
You thought that I fell off but now I'm attackin the field
All in Chicago, grindin, puttin it down
Crush blocks of MC's, I ain't playin around
Yo you heard me on The Bassment, givin it to 'em
Fake dudes hidin theyself, but I could see through 'em
Diggler, what? I'm tryin to live and raise kids
While you throwin up ya sign, I'm layin 'em down kid
Plus I'm back home now, doin my thing
Thirty dollars to Medina just to cop me a ring




A good friend, holds his drink
Bad company makes bad wine!
Drinking among friends
Red wine means a good life
A few drinks bring comfort
Two drinks are enough!
Money can't buy courage!
Riches mean nothing to us!
Brilliant, a display of genius



(Intro: Cappadonna)
It's always a struggle, yeah
Don't care how you look at
P.J.'s, you know how it get, dirty, dirty
Straight up and down, whole Staten Island (uh-huh)
Slums, still the same, dude... word

(Cappadonna)
From Park Hill to Jungle Nil', we fight like Navy SEAL
Don't get killed, chicks can't run in them heals
Niggas whippin' out guns, payin' them bills
Life is a bitch, you best not snitch
Muthafucka, this the real, always
The dope fiends, the crack stashed in the hallways
Style hold it down, tell Polite call Kane
Don't never test this, we try'nna make all aids
Just niggas down when we blaze, crime pays
Survival in the P.J.'s, or graffiti experts, M.C.'s and the D.J.'s
Better watch your back when flippin' them pies
Real niggas be goin' down right in front of your eyes
If you on the block gettin' it, or a straight nine to five
Still real, Homicide Hill, police circlin'
NARCs got pictures of your grill, street turbulance

(Chorus: Cappadonna)
Cuz everytime I close my eyes, I could feel the rain
And everywhere I seem to go girl, can't stop the pain
No... can't stop the pain, no..

(Cappadonna)
Uh... this one's for mamma
Niggas be gettin' slumped in my projects, it's real violent
Crackheads be on the steps, young bloods'll pop somethin'
Just to get that rep, everyday it's like this
Don't even come outside, if you ain't try'nna get no rich
Niggas murk each other for a small amount of chips
Bloods fightin' other Bloods, there's no Crips where I live
Somethin' gotta give, niggas bust one another
Turn around and watch other kids, my hood's straight 7:30'in
It get buckwild and the blocks is still dirty
Cameras in the hall, bulletholes left in the wall
Laundromats locked up, floods in the building
The front drain is stopped up, I've been in the hood
Ever since my pain popped up, but just in case
One of ya'll niggas forgot, look at your head nigga
What's that little red dot? Got ya!

(Chorus 2X)
(Outro: Cappadonna)
Give me the bread, heavy on the cheese
Uh... straight like that
Population Click! What's the deal
FMF, PGL, Osama Island
All my niggas in Crimestock, Sing-Sing, what's the deal?
Far Rock' posse, Queens, Brooklyn, P-Lon
That's my word... dance with this!
Get your guns together... takin' pictures..




It's always a struggle, yeah

Yo yo yo yo yo (Guess who's back?)


Aiyo I thought I told y'all before that Cap is Back
And the bitches in the club said Cap is Back
I got them thugs over there that said Cap is Back
And them Bloods over there who said Cap is Back


I don't have to tell y'all niggas how it is in Da Struggle
Police chasin' me down, niggas start to bubble
Cracks and Blood niggas in the huddle
It's rainin' cats and dogs, and kids in the puddles
We still in the game like Poppy, Chad and P-Double
Hard-headed niggas causin' the trouble
Stank-ho niggas wanna see niggas behind the bubble
So they could start fuckin' ya man
Space Invadin' ass niggas takin' up land
Tryin' to understand my ill pain
No matter what you do I'mma still gain in Da Struggle
(Fuck you, double, niggas shoot dope in the game
This shit is serious)




Aiyo it's not a game
You play chess with life, end up in the flame
Y'all snakes is five dollars and I'm about to make change
Out of devious chicks and niggas that lack brains
I'm on a whole 'nother level, kid feel me
Yeah, nigga, it's the real me
The project roaches, hoodrats, the broke TV
You can't see me
And let it be known that, any pretty ass chicks, nigga? I want that
Voodoo ass bitches get thrown back
You can't dethrown Cap
Stay focused on the regular
Be in the Hoopty with a shorty on the cellular
Lovin' my project like Nelson Mandella
Or the church love Christ, just pass the paper
Everything be alright, from Da Struggle
(Uh-huh, you two faced motherfuckers)




Y'all don't like me and I don't like none of y'all niggas


You don't have to ask twice, I'm still in the Hill
Been all around the world, it's hard to pay bills
What you think? That Da Stuggle ain't real?
Rappers don't murder shit, niggas won't get killed?
You just a baby on an E. pill
And I'm ill with the skill
Shake the po-po off me
Runnin' fuckin' the ho's, fuck how y'all niggas feel
I'm too official
Any time, nigga, I could come get you
You shook while you got sickle
Brothers amongst brothers
Stay to make babies but they not wit you
Bleed with you, they snitch for the police too
Reptiles in the Benzo
The come adept, what they still do to ya clit
Struggle with this

[Interlude: Cappadonna (Lounge Mode)
Come on (y'all comin' real fast, push the love
I'm killin' you) To all y'all niggas out there
Yeah (go with y'all man, go with y'all)




Right in ya balloon you two-faced bitch

Yeah, I used to love y'all niggas
(Skeero is wit us man
Yo how ever y'all wan' do it man)
Now when I see you (when I see you

Every night you niggas get it right
Every nigga with a mic
Wanna spit some pages
Well nothing is safe
Straight anus
You a homo thug that got famous
Dont wanna hear your thought
You little wack report
Your lifestyle dont fuckin entertain us
Its all fake nigga
Stick to the basics
Drugs, moneys, hoes, no innovation
Im too real for your radio station
Djs might lose their jobs they try to play this


C-a-pp-a 
Consider all poor people acceptable


Hook off (echoes)




When you study the historic nature of revolutions
You may change your goal and you may change your mind
Look at the American Revolution in 1776
That revolution was for what? For land
Why did they want land? Independence
How was it carried out? Bloodshed
Number one, it was based on land, the basis of independence
And the only way they could get it was bloodshed
You don't have a peaceful revolution
You don't have a turn-the-other-cheek revolution
There's no such thing as a nonviolent revolution


The hard times, tough pain, heavy rains coming down on me (Cap's back again)
Up all night, sleeping in the streets, life ain't treating right (Cap's back again)
A fatherless child, escaped from work release, and plus blew trial (Cap's back again)
Reptiles in the BM-Dub, lizards and fake wizards (Cap's back again)
The dirty staircase, pissy hallways, I'm in the grind, always (Cap's back again)
Twisted ass record deal, spiritual albums, I feel like Malcolm X (Cap's back again)
Cab driver status, wild baby mothers, two sisters and two brothers (Cap's back again)
Two tours with Ghost, the chrome toast, no calls from Rae (Cap's back again)
Fall off, then I get back on, ya'll best to be warned (Cap's back again)
From bum to rich, broke, back to fly again, baby what's what? (Cap's back again)
The ill rapper, try'nna feed my triplets and still flip on this shit (Cap's back again)
From New York to Baltimore, I'm coming hard, no matter what, kid, I still want more (Cap's back again)
Cats is still sleeping on me, but so what, cuz these streets put a beating on me (Cap's back again)
Two Benzes, Cadillac truck, head in the whip, still living it up (Cap's back again)
I'm in the projects for life, pain so deep that it cut like a knife (Cap's back again)
I'm going all the way with this, and to them stupid reptiles
That admit they did this (Cap's back again)
None of ya'll cats can see me, ya'll got it mixed up when you see me on MTV
(Cap's back again)
Forever pushing the pain, never fall back, it's like I'm pushing the train
(Cap's back again)
Fronts in the mouth, ACG's, golden brown army fatigues (Cap's back again)
Momma in the housing, I'm trying to make thousands, what you gonna do now?
(Cap's back again)
Fake cats never show 'em no love, when I see 'em, yo, I'm throwing slugs (Cap's back again)
It's all over for dudes, the time is now, Staten Island side chika-pow! (Cap's back again)


Ping pong with this...
It's how I be beating your head against the words...
Diggaler, Deini, yo...
Respect the king..., the first...
Uh-huh, Staten Island stand up...
Straight up and down, right here
This is Tyzeen street music
Crack barrels of rap... get 'em... yeah...




Wait, hold up, chill, what's that, son?
Damn nigga got fucked, shit, huh?!
By his back, watch nigga run
Seven the center of your eight point Sun
Hold tight grip on the God-U Now, you best be careful!
Can't dodge two Self-Hes aimed at your domepiece
Father-U-C-King police!!


Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum
Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum


Yo, Rae it's been a long time son since we bust gun
Clap glaciers, ran the world and snatched paper
Return to the 36th Chamber
Proceed with caution as you enter
We have an A.P.B. on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a master


Yo something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang thang
Something in the street went BANG BANG..


Up in the boss game wilding, money for grabs
I ain't fucking with crabs, out of state copped two labs
Hopped two cabs, back on the Ave
Stab you with the vocab, catch me at the big dough rehab
Tryna re-up, keep my feet up
Snake niggas in the cut, hold the product
Time is up, no luck, heat start to bust
Niggas you can't trust, dealing with lust
Seen him at the ballgames with James


Something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang thang
Something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang


Something in the hall went 
The boxcutter went 
Something in the hole went 
The boxcutter went 


These are the bones, bones from the grave of Houdini
G-Deini, Ronzoni noodles sprinkled on your embry'
Climb like the deficit, profits, death threats
To Israel slid through Bethlehem bong on one wheel
Syringes, rubber bands, needles, the 60's
Granddaddy Caddy was copping 6 G's
B'gosh all that Oshkosh jumpers
Pink Champelle, brown paper bags, wall to wall bumpers


These ain't the camera guys, cause, turn your eyes
Sweat on the hammer fly, Ways of the Samurai
Newsflash bulletin, Gods on the prowl
We full again, ruff men scuff Timbs
Sonic bionic lens, RZA console
Is it Bush or the Dole, front row of the Superbowl
Black gold in my soul, on a ho stroll
Don't go boy you on parole you don't know?


Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK


Made 'em throw they hands up but then lay flat
Rat pack eat up, the average alley cat
Prepare for the impact when we contact
Known to drop facts that crack your hard hat
Must I show and prove, trust I, bust I
Make your head spin like chrome 20's on the buggy-I Benz
Who contends, Wu like the Superfriends
Who's your rhyming hero? Wu-Tang rules again


Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK


Yo something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang thang
Something in the street went, BANG BANG..


Something in the hole went 
The boxcutter went 
Something in the hole went 
The boxcutter went 


Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum
Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum




Chains
Yo
I got anger in my feet
Eggs in my rice
I got a tough life
I was busted way more than twice
I see low but I don't play with the dice
Triple on the mic nigga fuck you
Whip you on this mic
Nigga stuck you
Fabulous clothes, fabulous hoes
Keep away from the so and sos
Nigga bless you
85  snake eyes guys
Last seen eating spiced hamburgers and fries
Murderous
Chase the observers
My verbage is slang pros
Hold back the Maz
While I'm puffing my reefers
Mamacitas, yeah my (?) want to holla
We seen pigs in a black impala
Reefer falling out of the window
Like a fucking rain shower
I knew those niggas over there
Would straight cower
Height is the tower
The game is Mayflower
Mad honeys under my power
Staten Island
The Dutch red wrapped around the sour
Smoke flowing out the top of the bower
Chicks go hard
We push raps for hours
The world is ours
We get it in where they don't allow us
Now drink cow piss nigga

Come on.... stand up Staten Island
Come on, what? What? Going down
Come on, clap, clap, clap
Ya'll muthafuckas thought I was gone?
Come on, clap, clap, clap
Pop pop, muthafuckas, it's on


Yo, it's been a while since you heard the god, thought that I fell off?
I had to hibernate, yo, never that, congratulate the boss
My life's like a movie feature, shit is hectic
The God paint the picture, but you slobs get the credit
You wonder why I'm still on the grind? It's just a way of life
What I got to do to live, this is what I got to give
Blood, sweat & energy, a thug don't cry
Why should I shed tears? Yo I'm in too deep, yo I was raised in
Yo, figure out my movements, federal watch
They said they got the boss snapshots, metal was cop
Catch me, graphical speaker, vision is clear
Could be the reefer, vision impaired, it gets deeper
Champagne, quarter to eight, makin' 'em sick
Face it, we bubble music like we jugglin' bricks
It's a hustle, confrontation we handle
Beef we never worry, cash, we never worry


Pop pop, muthafuckas, it's on...
Murder Island, oh shit, we don't take no shit
Give me the dough quick, we roll so thick
How is it that trespasses ho's get dick
What you know about this, we peep with the four-fifth
You can't see the bulk of it, that's our soldier shit
Peep the bolder fist, we uplift, first niggas to win
First niggas to flip, pop the clip for the architechts it's
No glitter, no glamour, no necklace, young & restless
Fuck a VIP, fuck the guest list, we spit lungies
And spark asbestos, we on some next shit, it's the best shit
Staten Island shit, Richmond Road be the exit
Don't get your legs tripped....
Pop pop, muthafuckas, it's on...


Woola heads representing Staten Island's criminal slums
We got the dirtiest sweatpants, but bit, we got bullets in the guns
Ass full of jums, blood all over my burberry
Do what I gotta do to eat, eat what I gotta eat
The Theodore Unit, got the security
I'm harder than shots of tequila, Solomon
A/K/A killa, deal 'em with the fever
Pop a nigga head off, when I'm feeling the fever
More clips from my motion picture, what's good about it?
And what's bad about it, my ancestors speak Egyptian
Who wanna preview the killings first?




Welcome to the West Coast
Where we ball, ride on fags
Sittin' back, cuz been working right
(Now let me you bounce) bounce (bounce) bounce
(Bounce) bounce (bounce) bounce, bounce, bounce
We've been working right (Calico stand up)


Now ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary, still ballin'
Ridin on these niggas cause they lame
In a six-one Chevy, still heavy in this game, can you feel me?
Blame it on my momma I'm a thug nigga
Up befo' the sun rise, quicker than the drug dealers
Tell me if it's on, nigga then we first to bomb
Bust on these bitch-made niggas hit 'em up, WESTSIDE
Ain't nobody love me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger Lord forgive me if I smoke niggas
I love my females strapped, no fuckin from the back
I get my currency in stacks, California's where I'm at - right?
Passed by while these niggas wonder by
I got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try
Did I cry, hell nah, nigga tear I shed
For all my homies in the pen, many peers dead, niggas still ballin




Ok, cash C-note, blasting me through your door
Flew from the old, cross seas for the blow
Weed's federal, better roll in the tape
Your armored truck stuck, cuz I'm taking the bass
But to be quite frank, taking over this world
I want best of both shines like diamonds and pearls
Never gave a fuck though, and paybacks a bitch
If I see my luck sold, then I'mma bag some kids
You know how it bad it is, half a g, an old scheme
Squeeze, play to rehab, cuz it's part of they plea
Surf the world to find material, harder than me
But I'm bigger than life, son, so what's what's larger than me?
Flaudelently, haters be claiming they guns hit
Knowing they ain't done shit, except go when the gun spit
Now who, retaliates, with the strip for the streets
I got peeps that conviscate with the strength of the heat, holla




Aiyo, I came in the game, like a thief in the night
And ya'll sucka MC's, ya'll be try'nna be bite
My whole style and my format, niggas should fall back
When I attack the mack, stay live and direct, I wreck
Set, keeping ya bitch wet, it's no sweat
Whenever I'm around you, your mind is weak
I speak the truth when I spit, ain't coming to talk shit
Yo, I'm live and direct, coming to stalk shit
What, come on, bitch, yeah, enter my zone
You can't imagine how my four-speed's ever so deadly
I swing swords, I hit you in your fucking head piece
Cuz you fronted on Don, and now you dying in hell
Spit my name, can't beat my tell, nigga, what's felt?
To the lost generation of rap, my niggas locked down
Whoever feel trapped, grab ya gat, quick, shoot ya where I plotted the bitch
Never let 'em hold you back, this is strictly the Don
If you ever front on me, nigga, I'm breaking your arm
Bees in the winter, enemies better be gone
Fuck all of the fly shit, ya'll Hollywood...




I fought off dragons with large wings, boxed dragons
Dressed as a gladiator, inside God's ring
The hearts of kings were eaten by the beast
Their flesh hung from their teeth, my right arm under his feet
My left arm pulls the gun, from out of the sheet
Blasted his stomach, body tumbled all over the streets
I heard trumpets, God hand brought me to my feet
My G., we resting five devils over the five boroughs
Broke the walls, into the tri-boroughs
Going through the ocean floors, going through the walls
Going through the malls, we just brawl and brawl and brawl and brawl
He went for my Adam's apple, blood splashing all over the tabernacle
Pull out swords, I got saws, he grabbed his gun, then I grabbed gats too
Start clapping, he collapsed and look what the mack do


We tough in the physical, tough in the spiritual
Watch it boy, you get dropped for the ritual
I pray to lord, to bless my soul
You come too close, our thoughts is cold
We're rough with the AK, so if you not
Make way, some of these get murdered
We rough with the fo-fo, so what we argue for?
Bust mine, somebody get murdered


Yo, it's New York in effect, it's time to get ill
Survival of the fittest, this is shit is for real
I've been sleeping all day, now I'm finally woke
And I selling no crack, and I slinging no dope
I'm a frontline nigga, stuck in the grind
Yo before I couldn't see, 'cause I used to be blind
Now I'mma smoke weed nigga, rock my shine
Lick a shot for The Punisher, and pop my nine
A'udhu Billahi Min ash-Shaitan ir-Rajeem
Allahu Akbar, caught Don Alon's fiend
Jails can't hold me, it's no cure for this
I smacked ya'll devils, outta my myst
Take the gun from ya hostler, grab your stick
I got a hatred for evil, son, times is hard
Can't destroy my heritage, we the armor of God
Lightning bolts hit your face, break your facade
Prophets and war mongers, leave you scarred
The hell fire gon' come, the fucking Goon Squad


"Lit rings"...
"Bangin' in yo hood"
"See, this the pusha"
"Goon's Squad visual, this that..
"Fire, fire.."
"It's defenitaly still"


Yo, my full time criminal mind, in overtime mode
Cold blooded, you get your face piece flooded
No ifs, ands, buts about it, who bout it bout it?
My body banger stay crowded, like rush hour
Turn a sweet thing sour, I pack a monster
Send shots for ya roster, who wanna trot?
Every man wanna go to heaven, but scared to die
Revenge I cried, try'nna take the crown from my
Head piece, Selassie 'dad, rest in peace
Who want peace? Change ya culture to kosher
Fucking with me, will have me on the wanted poster
Dead or alive, only the illest survive
Killa Haile, ride by the law of the land
Man to man, hold a steel, hand in hand
You over the hill, still too, old to spill
I roll for real, black down, dressed to kill
Until hell freezes, you better beef with Jesus
Like pussy teasers, I get you soakinng wet
Nigga fronted on my style, and I broke his neck
Run the respect, like I'm standing here with a tech
What you expect? Me must stand, the next man
The best man will die with his dick in his hand



* cut from the final release


Yea, yea
It's like rap pa', huh? What?
Y'all bitch-ass niggas, what? What?
Leave a mark on your face, duke
Word, uh-huh, you fake fucks
Eh-yo, eh-yo, eh-yo..

I bathe in a tub of guns, dry off with the clips
Now I'm automatic Jack, that's what I've become
Gangsta lean leanin, peach cobbler pockets fit the gram cracker
Outfit you still Dream of Jeanie in
Kings, stay 'greein, nightly prince Of Egypt
Plenty of days I read up, skiied up, whips all beat up
7:30, the sky is fallin, the most of this dyed with dirty urines
It's the dark-skinned Kris Kringle
Crisp bangle material, boggle minds how I popped up in your cereal
Rocks the eagle beat with the rocks pushed in
Pediatric wildin, grippin the floors like cushion
Samuel Jackson, Action Jackson, Mike Jackson, Staten
Dusthead niggas that'll have you laugh, you call
Quicker, and we brawl in big arenas, G&C
Catch me in the spot with a guillotine


In the back of the church, my book be the Book of Life
Donated nothin, hit the preacher wife
This go to all real niggas that be shootin dice
Stashin ya cracks and maggots stick to me in life


Eh-yo we pot of soil, shot our nines of chrome
Just watch how many minds get blown
When I cock mines behind your dome
They gon' find your bones
With your top popped behind your home
Havin a stumb' runnin to find ya phone
B.G.F. and when we the kind to roam
Roll through ya hood and we shine the stones
Blind every dime in the zone
Shit on every line in the poem
And drop a jewel like a diamond in Rol'
B.G.F. war ones, let the fours dump in the forefront with your horse ones
Your body found inside of a Ford trunk, smellin like four skunks
Blast up and cut into four chunks
Shot down and not found for four months
Who playin outfield without a chest shield?
Wanna move? Choose ya weapon of steel
Nigga we 'bout reppin for real
Only take a second to peel
Should've known there was a Tec in the deal, nigga


Yo man, you spoke to that dude about that situation?
- Yeah man, everything's straight, everything's cool, man
I made the connection
Yo man, I hope it ain't no Ohkeedoke, man
I won't have no bullshit
- Once he touch down, everything will be cool
You hear me, mothafucka?




Yo yo, what up? What up?
W.T.C. in the battery, Da Beatminerz
Shaolin, Brooklyn
Yo

The heat's still risin, y'all gon' get it
It's me with the fitted, chain hangin
With the flossy knitted, comin back for all y'all niggas that shitted
Off the vacation, God-U-Nation's inside the gat truck
I don't give a fuck, Killa Bees merge with the MC's for life
Nigga night out, ladies too, floss too much
It's time to jump you, live on the avenue
The fly Gucci's, I could never sweat y'all hoochies
Pillage for life, we don't have to shine
Wu-Tang in the cut, we all engaged with it
Don't never get stuck, Beatminerz got the permit
Jail niggas keep food in the toilet
I can't call it, three months on the bus
No God-degree, W.T.C, we ain't changed a bit
Dirty in the beast but we still thick






Let's get it on Kokomo
John John Blazeini, Donna J-Bird
Yeah
Another Persian legacy

 The Iron Lung


Yo yeah, yeah, yo, yo
Dart throwing, yo aimin at your nostril, Aropostale
Sword rockin halibut steak we choppin
Mili-tia, eight to nine generals at one time
Fine we blend wine, go beyond one line
Spot the snakeskin, Dunn was scaley
Chopped his head off fuhrilly, sit back, crack the Bailey's
Wetter than white milk, grab the quilt - that's the heater
My nigga drop lost a stripe like adidas
Shit is deep, the bridge still burnin
The long time earnin, just got snatched by more Germans
Europeans are seein me bleedin, jet off in
The Lex skiin, goggles, Louis Rich Sweden


I dig my life experiences, wrap it up
In twelve inches, keepin my defenses
Put it up in raw trenches, holdin court on the park benches
In the ghetto servin life sentence
Mass confusion in New York, on these city sidewalks
Busy sidewalks, there's no snoozin
Stop actin like it's me losin, peep my modern day
Pompei on city streets, the Sun pack heat
In Hell's Kitchen, time to get money finger itchin
Once again plot thicken, and you succumb
To the will of the slum bite your tongue
Burn a bush with the Iron Lung, pay dirt to no one
Guilty by association, stank bitch
Wanna give me some, nappy nasty -- I pass
Let them players flash, and trick on they cash
On your funky ass I only buy shit that last
A lifetime I write rhyme, chippin through
The pipeline then it's flight time, that's when I'm jetty
In a fifty-seven Chevy, gassed on my own Getti
Head heavy, with deadly medleys


I opened up my rap Bible, then the light came
Over the children, as it began to rain
I started buildin, spoke many times before
But didn't score, my reading was poor
Injected with the Devil's english, I extinguish
And approach all hominyms, shit in your brain
Wipe my ass with the phenonmenyms, be holy
Or get shot down with the Moet-o, kid encyclopedia
Left y'all petrol, my dancehall standoff
Rap like Peter Metro, echo echo, what?
Beware my psycho, limw piece tec-o leggo
Uniform flow, stay strong black my shit is real
Peace out bro


Tical
Eyes as diamonds, time again
Motherfuckers wanna battle with the bat or pen
Give it to em raw, give it to em raw
Down to the fuckin floor, up to the roof with the proof
Meth-Tical mad, god damn!
Hahahaha, right
Motherfuckers

I came up from a tough time, now I'm finally back
I got love in my heart and I changed my rap
I don't worry about dudes talk behind my back
Because I'm good with the music and I love the track
It's me, it's big Don and I'm so full of life
Still praying for the day that God give me a mic
I pray each and every day and I pray at night
I got music in my soul and I love to write
While brothers kick dirt on name, just for spite
I do what God tell me to do, shine my light
Ya'll suffer for mad years, been beat wit many stripes
I know what the ghetto like, tears cover my face to the sample of the pain
I inherited the streets like crack cocaine
All the while, yo I kept surviving it, money
Stand away from the knucklehead niggas and dummies
And still mama love me back
And I ain't perfect, but I was blessed wit a good heart
I know how to work it, face it
Most of ya'll gon' die over money
While I'm laid back chilling, where it's nice and sunny
Now check it, I ain't the type to hang with the crowd
You might see me at the spot where the music is loud
Classic R&B, a little jazz, spoken word
Posted on the sideline wit a crazy bird
Trying to take my mind off of the herb
I sip fine wine, when I was young, I used to do mad crime
Now daddy's all grown up, yo, and time is precious
I reflect back on my seeds and all of my records
Feed my family with this shit, they gotta respect it
You gotta love me or leave me alone, there's no half stepping
I grew up and I found out, the mind is a powerful weapon, and love is the message
So ya'll can stop fronting on me, you too far in the game
For ya'll to keep stunting on me, Cappadonna the first fruit
Straight outta God mansion, never stuck in '86, I deal wit enhancement
Brothers make music and they steal my advancements
Cock suckers sit in a circle, watch me rap
Ya'll niggas don't owe me shit, but I'mma pay ya'll back


To all my real niggas, this is real hip hop
And my niggas locked up, that sell that crack
Get ya mind right, get this track
To all my niggas that bust they gat, nigga, brat-brat-brat


I said the last time I stepped in the booth, I had the deuce wit me
Told niggas, send the shit down, because he shoots wit me
I'm in the building where them niggas, they pump hard
And give money, if cops come, yeah, and they run hard
Right where the stash at, yeah, I'mma blast back
I'm so old school, dope bomb in my ass crack
I left the past and the present, I'm past that
I told you my publishing is sitting on ASCAP
Fuck you, boy, take a walk and go ask Cap
And I be lingering, just where the cars be
And doing my numbers at a show where the stars be
Representing my hood, the good boogah get burnt out
And bitches called Sugar get turned out
Bring your hammer, the finger blam like Yosemite Sam
And if I can't get you, my Stone'll give me your man






We are the G-O-D's
And we came to rock the spot
Like Ironman Starks
They be the illest MC's, in the world today
Cappa Raekwon and the R-Z-A
So listen to them clear, and put the box right near your ear
Light your blunts and down your beers
Cause you could never fuck with Wu-Tang Killer Beez

"From where we at to my man's cell
From where we at"


Say peace to cats who rock MAC Knowledge Knowledges
Street astrologists, light up the mic God, acknowledge this
Fly joints that carry two points, Corolla Motorola holder
Play it God, E-pack over the shoulder
Chrome tanks, player like Yanks, check the franchise
Front on my guys, my enterprise splash many lives
Repel all fakes like reflectors
He had sugar in his ear in his last crack career
We can can him, manhandle him, if you wanna
Run in his crib-o, get ditto, skate like a limo
And jet to the flyest estate, relate take a break
Break down an eighth and then wait, drop it like Drake
Thugs they be booing and screwing, we canoeing
Claim they doing the same shit we doing, fuck a union
It's the same style, RZA train a boy, jump the turnstile
On the island he tried to challenge God for the new bals
Especially that, aluminum bat in the Ac
Relax, lay back, sell a grenade a day, it pays black
The Mac-10 flex wipe cats like Windex
Index finger be sore busting these fly scripts
The Wally kid count crazily grands with our plans
Laying with my bitches and my mans in Lex Lands
We losing 'em, jet to the stash in Now Jerusalem
Abusing 'em, rocking his jewels like we using 'em
Low pro star, seven thick waves rock Polar
Roll with the older Gods, build with the Sun, Moon and Star


All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that shit that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring you Shaolin's finest
But if your skills are weak you better step behind us

"Ghostface--Ghostface Killah!!"


Mercury raps is roughed then God just shown like taps
Red and white Wally's that match, bend my baseball hat
Doing forever shit like pissing out the window on turnpikes
Robbing niggas for leathers, high swiping on dirt bikes
Voice be mellow like Vaughn Harper, Radio Barber
Murder sleep away camp, the fly lady champ
The arsonist, who burn with his pen regardless
Slaying all these earthlings and fake foreigners
In the Phillipines, pick herbal beans, bubbling strings
Biochemical cream, we burn kerosene
The conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon
Blond heads, inscriptions with three sixes in
Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive
I slapbox with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph
Zoom in like binoculars, the rap blacksmith
Money's Rolex, was rockless, Chef ragtop is spotless
I'm Iron Man no die-cast metal, I'm steel-alloy
True identity hidden inside secret tabloids
Breathe oxygen, both sides of my jaw carry oxes
The track hit like the bangers, in hundred watt boxes
Yo jostling these cats while Little J be deli-ing
Sip Irish Moss out of Widelians

"rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell"


All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that shit that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring you Shaolin's finest
But if your skills are weak you better step behind us

"Cappa-Cappa-Cappa-Cappachino"


Give me the the fifty thou, small bills
My gold plate, my slang kills
My beer spills, what up lils?
Murder one dun
Killer bee stung, guess who back home son
My technique of slang camp won, third platoon soon
Cristal bottles, cages of boom, Papi wardrobe
The mad-hatter big dick style, beware goons
Smuggle balloons, lornadoones in fat pussy wounds
Let the Gods build, pull up the grill
Check out the mad skills
Top secret technique, too hard for you to peep it and keep it
Jiggy style of rap and watching knuckle slang sweep it
Out of order tape recorder can't record my slaughter
Spoil the rotten Donna too good to be forgotten
High top notch, borderline rhymes is hand-cocked
Ninety-six, my ill sound clash is still hot
Get yourself shot


All these MC's start realizing
That Ghost got that shit that'll keep you vibing
The Wu is here to bring you Shaolin's finest
But if your skills are weak you better step behind us




I'm in the weed spot, pounds of purp
All the cereal cartoons is on, my favorite shit is the Smurfs
Now I don't slip when I'm down in the dirt
Cause by this time I done seen life and figured the amount that it's worth
It's the first, cops is looking for work
Got my niggas all cuffed up, sweating like a hooker in church
This old woman on her way to the church
She said the neighborhood's fucked up, and we the ones that's making it worse
Now that's fucked up!
I hit the block hard, Timberlands is scuffed up
No justice in the system, look around, it's just us
They tell me only God can judge us
But they ain't ever met Judge Koffler
I'm looking at this cracker on the bench
Don't understand, I only sold crack to pay the rent
Got possession with intent
Player, I ain't stressing, I'm a pimp
My bitches love the cocktail dressing with the shrimp

Hurting the game like the corns that's on your daddy's foot
My niggas carry big guns, y'all niggas carry books
You shook niggas get stripped, beated and wiped out
ConEd status like Fab, nigga it's "Lights Out"
What your life 'bout? Nigga, my life plush
I lost both of my parents, my nigga life sucks
Us Billy Boys hold toys
Cause they don't like us
Raw like the nose on a fiend sniffing that white stuff
Moving with the semi
Eggplant Pennies
Hopping out the Bentley
Looking like I just won an Emmy
Never been a sloucher, dogg cause I'm an alpha-male
Got that product on sale, look at your voucher
Leave that other gang
I'm Spanky, you Alfalfa
Little Rascals
With no hassle I will out ya
Sincerely doubt ya
And I will house ya
Posted out in front of your crib just like a scapler


Cause we do it like how we do it
This is big truck style shit
Diesel fluid
Slay bitches with the Shaolin slang
Stapleton
Park hill
We just doing our thing


Every time pick up the mic
I put work down
Cops don't like me cause I live in a murk town
My high school homies sold crack through songs
You can't get right through the team, like two wrongs
Mad "Criminal Minded" "C.R.E.A.M." muthafuckas
Type of subliminal rhymes: scheme muthafuckas
Can't shake the monkey, life is a bitch
Jake tried to jump me, wifey a snitch
Killa bees wild like C-74
New York bitch, adolescents at war
Fuck the government, yo, they made us this way
You a faggot: listen to what that chick say
Escape route gotta be free like ?
Fuck hoes, nigga I don't care if the world know

Diss me in the cab and they murk your man
I'm a general
Don, with the crazy hype game
You don't like me, wanna feel my knife game
Killah Hill, son
They don't like where I live at
Came from Hollywood so I fight to give back

Hard jeans and hard dick
Move in and out of state like drugs and garbage
Nigga feel me

Just guns and cash


Cause we do it like how we do it
This is big truck style, shit
Diesel fluid
Slay bitches with the Shaolin slang
Stapleton

Just keep away (just keep away
Go on, it's not your fight!)
It's not yours nigga, fall back
I'm about to blow something out here
Straight up, yeah, this is a family thing
We gon' handle our business and shit
These muthafuckas know not to come around here like that
This is real shit, real talk
Four different niggas, with four different aspects, nigga
This is family shit
Who the fuck said family ain't family no more, nigga?
This is tight shit, tighter than white in ya wallet


Yo, I'm talking bags of heavy coke, bracelets on every men
Innocent dope pushers, over night king pins
Indeed, we smack niggas up for their cheese
Throw bleach in yo face, got beef, let it be chuck
The streets don't know my peeps
Jumpin' out of UPS trucks, blowing niggas off they feet
With four-four gloves, rims spinning, tippin' on fo-fo's
My mouth be worth millions, something like Paul Wall's
Ladies look out; they ain't thugs, they homo's
The film look hyper, when I clap 'em in slo mo'
Ya'll still paying the mob? We whip niggas out like waffle batter
Theodore ancient with dart, flossin' them diamonds
Discussing our hits over a glass of scotch
Baywatch bitches that ski, take turns when they hand us the twat
Think not, we still run the trains, til the condom pop
On the low, we still fucking them cops
Pretty things from all precints, friday nights, we holding they Glocks
This is family, nigga, niggas can't stand me
Next up, my little man, I hand you the jammy


You know the fam, what it is, it is what it is
S.I.N.Y., where the animals live
Ass bet, niggas run in yo cribs
I don't care if you blast for the cash, then scramble yo wig
I'm like "Damn, what a wonderful kid"
I could do what I want, doing dirt, not serving a bid
You know a real fam handle they biz, everybody get searched
From the grandpops, down to the kids
And my time, I'm officially here, tell ya man
Go and start up ya car, start shifting the gears
Sun God got the pits for his ears, cuz niggas is scared
Hoping I don't let it blow in they ribs
I said hot, niggas get robbed non stop
Once the gun cock, niggas strip down to they socks
And my fam at the tippity top, I won't stop
Believe it or not, you and ya man is close targets
Juks everything, dice games, mini markets
Fam gon' spark it, I'mma take whatever's in the pockets
Mostly the cash and the wallet, slide off the jewels
Cuz you shining, begets and the diamonds
Never deny niggas with iron... YO!


Aiyo, chillin' with the Ceasar crew
We can smoke, all in the halls
It's how many niggas with guns, got 'em on
All tip top, cling to the fullest, mad bullets
This is a hobby, the lobby where they clap yo hoods
Get the paper, word to everything, we a acre up
Barbequin' like a mutt, we ain't taking nothing
A high tech extremist, Gatorade, paid ya boy some money
To lay up on the low, swinging beamers
I need to be an actor, but instead, I'd rather be in Hempstead
All of my bread came from crack barbers and shoppers
So much beef in these whoppers
Guns that'll knock out floors and hit choppers
What? What? The family remains, cuz it's grain
It's automatic, I live it and I claim it
It's real, come around here, you bought here
Yo, lay that half tape, then you will get wrapped real quick


Aiyo, we hug the block on President's Day
Swinging all year round, gettin' that money the American way
Might run up in yo wedding, grab the reverand and spray
And let the shots for whatever they may
This is family, nigga, minus the mob size
The resurrection of Toney Starks & Trife Dies', starring in Part 5
Niggas'll rather die when they're pride's in question
Try'nna play hero, getting stuck for they prized possessions
Look you staring in the eyes of oppression, that's why I ride with protection
Extended clips, super sizing my weapons
Five eleven, keep the heat tucked
That'll burn a hole thru ya stomach like acid reflux
Get buried in ya cheap tux'
We make it hard for you niggas to keep up
Been thru a hundred towns, and running, beating the streets up
Come up north in New York, down in Miami, pumping
At a table, breaking bread like a family


Florida, where we follow the code of the streets and
Breaking the beats and, we taking the eats
Never the least, we invading the streets
Shaking the beast, we familiar for life
We don't run, we grab knives, my double edged spit life
My dogs is real tight, shooting the dice
Some of my fam might snatch ya ice
Got family that go to church, come back like you don't work
Got family that'll set you up, got family that chill, wanna spark the dutch
Wizard my fam, that stuck you up, I got fam that'll fuck you up
Chop you up, put your body in the back of the truck
Osama Island, we been wilding, see the violence
We display talent, respect balance, nigga, Shaolin




Six years in the game, nigga, I ain't changed a bit
Get with is, get up, yeah, come on

Chicks start doin' they thing, you gotta hear us
We always in effect, man, police don't scare us
We smoke weed in the clubs, drinkin' a little beer-a
Post up love, honeys in the mirror
Turn the mics up so they can hear a little clearer
Real niggas and fly honies is in the area
Vibe with me, come on, stride with me
And when you start feelin' this shit, just slide with me
Lay back on this, come on, glide with me


Do it, push..
Do it, do it, do it


Aiyo, whose the illest rappers, I don't really give a shit

We at the livest event, and to get in this bitch

Come on, all of ya'll niggas on the left start clappin'
All of ya'll honey's on the right start clappin'
All in together now, get ready for the rappin' (come on, do it..)
Me and my click came over for some action
Sippin' on Hen dog, everybody maxin'
Next thing you know, these niggas start yappin'
Heads was gettin' flown, jaws started crackin'
But then shit calm down, everything was chill
Stupid muthafuckas wanna test our skill
Ok, back to the beat, now, how it feel?




Ladies love how it's goin' down
Cuz we always show 'em love, everytime that we come around
And niggas like how we doin' shit
It's just a couple muthafuckas wanna ruin the shit
You little thugs can't wait for the tunes to hit
Niggas is wildin' out, racoons'll spit

Yes, I'm holding (And ya'll gon love this shit)


Realize this realizm, living life on the edge
When your hood's at war with police and the feds
Schitzophrenic, paranoid, with the ratch' in my waist
Anybody out of luck could get put back in their place
Catchin case after case, man, streets is real
Till the judge give you numbers the size of football deals
And appeals cost a fortune, every block hot and scorching
Nowadays the only way you gettin paid is by extorting
Coffin cherry red, many dead up in the box
Violent for many years, why you think it's gon stop?
Only thing we look for, money and some cooked raw
Feels like a recession, so why you think we crook for
Bootleg liquor, drinkin squeeze, little gs
Bloody keys that be spreading through the streets like a disease
We sieze opportunities, blessing our communities
Everybody for delf, there's no hope for unity




Started writing rhymes by the age of thirteen
Bout the shit I dealt with and learned in the streets
Hustle hard son, that's why I'm getting known in the scene
Guess I'm just a kid from the hood who fathered a dream
And grew up, in fact, I've always been a fan of the game
From Wu-Tang, to Biggie, to even Dr. Dre
It's like I learned from the best in every possible way
I give my all on every record, every one of them bang
Thats how I got this far, thats why I run so hard
It's why I'm never gon stop till I'm popular
Came up man, I'm always gon rep for def
Till I'm seeing record sales cuz I'm lining the shelves
Yeah, so whatchu know aobut the shit I went through?
To get where I'm at and where I'm about to head to
From runnin on the streets to getting live in the booth
On tracks with Krumb, beef, I ??? as Wu




Yessa yessa, real music, 2005, we gon make it this time kid
More money, for real, more dollars, more love, more knowledge
Yessa yessa, throw ya joint up, uh huh, if you got hip-hop on your mind
What, uh




Yo, I wanna dedicate this song right here
To everybody that feel like giving up
Thought it was too rough for you or whatever
There's no turning around, there's no looking back
Chase your dreams, do what you gotta do
I got your back


Picture me turning around, cuz I'm already set
In the game, and I'm holding it down
I went from, rags to riches, riches to rags
From Baltimore to Staten Island, slums, driving in cabs
Never gave up on my dreams as a young teen, serving the fiends
On my block with my Puma's and jeans
Been many places in the world, used to be out in Queens
Me and my China, AB, my doola since rock
A couple years before Biggie and Pac
I remember stashing cracks in my little shoebox
Now I'm back on the grind, claiming a spot
On tour with Ghostface, I love it alot
Me and my whole team hungry still stuck in the grot
Rather be out in the streets than being stuck in the box
What up, I just here linger with my two foots up
I don't have to play the six, now, I be in the cut
I be lamping like a lamp post, you loving my touch
Crack smiles at the hoodrats, they cracking they Dutch
And it's music I for soul, that's why I'm never gonna give it up


That's right, you can't afford to give it up, cuz
Don't turn around, ain't no looking back, you know
This is the better life movement right here, you know
Ain't nothing back there for us, we gotta learn
From the things we did in our past, gotta push forward, you heard?


There just ain't no turning around, no matter what happen
Gotta push forward, knew my vision was clear ever since I first saw it
Used to carry a stacks, but now I can't afford it
It get real in my life, that's why I camcord it
Sometimes I'm down on my luck, but I always fought it
Constantly moving, I'mma keep climbing up the ladder
Locking the evil out until my pockets get fatter
Helping momma love, cuz you know that's how I do it
And when my babies call, man, you know I jump to it
And ain't no looking back, don't forget in past sentence
Stay focused, maybe I can push another Benz
Up on the radio, get a little more spins
I keep writing cuz I'm feeling like I got the wins
If I ain't home, probably next door at Trina Kim's
Thinking about investing time into our future
Still carry the torch and sing a song for Luther
And through the process, I'mma steady, keep love my neighbor
And give thanks, Jesus Christ, be my lord and savior


Uh-huh, yo, this one right here is for everybody
That thought they couldn't make it
Want to give up on their dreams, yeah
Don't even worry about it, yo, it's gon' get better
Just don't look back, man


Yo, it's no more turning around, Popa Al told me
Keep on holding the crown, I got my two feet
Posted on solid ground, I know my daughter look nice in an African gown
And for my seeds, yo, believe me, I'mma keep it popping
I told ya'll before, quit can never be my option
This one's for Bill Cosby Jr. and my man Cochran
That's why I'm putting my heart, into another doctrine
And still giving my best, that's why I'm steady rocking
Loving my people, while I'm thinkin' bout Christmas shopping
Throwing darts cuz we try'nna keep these albums dropping
I ain't selling no crack and I ain't picking cotton
Get a nine to five, what? Man, you think I'm stopping?
I'm going hard for my people, gone not forgotten


Yo, Dini? (What up)
Yo, remember you used to be chasing them cars, man
In the streets (I'm saying them days is over for me, daddy)
I hear that (remember them days, when you used to come through
To cut through the building, with the get ya on your side
With the fucking...) Mask on... yeah, son
Them days is behind me, I'm saved now
(So I guess it's safe to say, we gon' move forward with this)
Until them future songs, with a new psalm
(Trying to Cappatilize) Off of everything we doing




Yo, Ohh man, Yo
Yo you remember when your girl used to like me and you
Ahh man, It's all good though cause like yo
Man, You my best friend my dude
You know what I'm talking about, We been doing this for years
Here you can hold my gazelles yo, Word


Yo, Do you remember when we used to make zip guns, Shooting em
Playing skelly plus balls, We be routing em
Hop Scotch, High-waters, Pops gave us quarters
Rock candy, Miss Terry with the cute daughters
Spin the bottle, Catch kiss and get a little bit
I remember when we used to carry little sticks
Mad ribbons in they hair, We kept little chicks
Block parties, Roller skating up and down the block
Red Alert, Bambaataa, Plus Dr. Rock
Gucci frames, No lenses with the big box
Reebok's in every color with the slout socks
Dyed hair, Lotto sneakers plus polka dots
I remember when we never heard of crack spots
Best friends, Little straws on the bike rims
Tight Lee's, Bell bottoms with the stripe blends
Halloween, Thanksgiving, Plus Christmas
Now brothers acting like they never even heard of this


Do you remember, Do you remember, Do you rememmmbbbeer
Do you remember, Do you rememmmbbbeer
When we used to play shoot em up, Shoot em up
Bang-Bang, Bang-Bang
Do you remember, Do you rememmmbbbeer
Do you remember, Do you rememmmbbbeer


Do you remember when we used to eat beans and franks
And Momma Love used to get on us to say our thanks
Or when we used to play tag, Hiding under the couch
Trying to get in rec parties, They was kicking us out
And how about when we used to play hookie from school
And somebody else parents beat us, And mega junk food
Do you remember Kangol hats were stuffed with plastic
And bowl cuts we had were shaped like a basket
We used to be at the center squeezing a chicks butt
And everybody that was corny we called em a duck
Sometimes we beat box and we bang on tables
Graffetti was everywhere, Plus the fat gold cables


Do you remember, Do you rememmmbbbeer
Do you remember, Do you rememmmbbbeer
When we used to play shoot em up, Shoot em up
Bang-Bang, Shoot em up
Do you remember, Do you rememmmbbbeer
Do you remember, Do you rememmmbbbeer


Yeah, Yo, You know what was real funny man
Why all the time we used to have like holes in our knees
On our pants, On our jeans
We always kept holes right there for some strange reason
And remember when we used to have the sneakers
They used to like, Go out in the back
And sometimes the sock be ripped in the back
And sometimes in the front too
And then the sneaker used to wear down...




I have a dream, today...
In what will go down in history
As the greatest demonstration for freedom
In the history of our nation
I have a dream...
To make justice a reality for all of God's children

"Tell me, this is a dream" - The Delfonics sample


Of a big house, too many whips
Mad wives and kids running out, what's that all about?
Of me taking trips, overseas
Getting my stacks up, cuz baby, now I'm getting big cheese
Triple platinum sales, walking down the isle
With my cream in the background, what, I'm hearing church bells
Of getting back all of my paper
That Razor Sharp stole from me, yea, kid it's only one me
A crush and an R&B chick, she looking real thick
But she was only after my chips
A free of momma love, out of the slums
Invested all my property into my daughters and sons
Of connecting the dutch, with the haze
Feeling mad tired, from guards, I ain't slept in four days
Of hooking up with all of the top rappers
Just came home from this club called Cappa's Nappy


Tell me, this is a dream, somebody, please
Tell me, this is a dream, somebody, please
Tell me, this, is, a, dream


Of receiving awards, for the best album of the year
And oh yeah, for still having the best broads
Of doing my thing, everybody hating
But once I hit the top, they be up under my wing
Of producing these tracks, that sound phat
Starting my own label, now, nigga how you like that?
Of my baby mother's hurting theyselves
Thinking they was jerking me, but they was jerking theyself
Of all of the police that like my style
They wasn't feeling me, but now, they loving me now
Of being down on my luck, heading for the come up
Living in the hood, but yo, still it's all good
Of my brothers locked away, they came home
Don't give a shit about slot time, they carrying the curf' phone
Of my people, stop busting them slugs
Start united our people, stop fucking with drugs
What up?




Dream, this my last dream, this one is for you
Keep the mack milly by your side, don't let nobody stop you
Dream, me getting on
Me and Quazolla, gotta get that corn
Me, keeping it real
Staten Island, what, slash, Homicide Hill
Do what you do, don't forget about your people
They won't forget about you
And everything is all good
Afraid of God, man, do what you could
(I have a dream that one day
This nation will rise up
And live out the true meaning of its creed
We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal)




Ring around the rosie pocket full of tosie
Its lounging low return of the O.G
High grade smoker, .38 toaster
Building one-six-ooh wanted on the poster
Come (?) get beat down and broke up
I'm in the city where the homeless live
BC, G's beat, throw a stone don't play
Fly high cover you hood
My brother is good
Niggas who want a zigga
I wish you niggas front like (?) ain't got yall picture
Take a flick of the nozzle, I'm full throttle
(?) and get cracked in the head with a bottle
You know my motto
I'm right here standing firm
(?) I blam on him he put a hand on him
Listen to the words I speak
I could care less
If you had a vest or even work in the streets


We gon' put our feet together
We gon' ease on down the road
Ease on down, ease on down the road
We gon' put our feet together
We gon' ease on down the road
Ease on down, ease on down the road


We keep the streets jumping
Beats is pumping
Sport mad ice on
Yo New York (?)
Usher on the radio
Ne-Yo and all them
Suit you up
Your pants got tight at the ankle
Pink New York fitted, we say no thank you
Mister Rogers, radio wave
Jay-Z come through whole face shaved
50 Cent got the industry selling us crack
Yo Nas killed hip-hop, we bringing it back
Hip-hop, catch the (?) Funkmaster Flex
Come on mother fucker
Tell me what you want to do
Stop playing the same shit
Play us too
What up Clue
Peace to Doug E. and Slick Rick
Bang hard
We don't want to hear that other shit
We like M.O.P. music
Mob and Jaheem
While we crushing that pussy
Making that C.R.E.A.M
Grafitti writer (?) rhymes like that
Staten, Africa protect ya neck
Stand back
Get your hustle on
C block control the block
Everybody on the east side hold ya spot
Everybody on the west side make it hot
We don't have to sell our soul to get to the top
C'mon yo




All in the club like what? Rugged dressed up
Hair messed up, gold on my neck
Don't sweat y'all show respect Poppa on the set
Death threat, I come a long stretch you can bet
Love is love, for real for real
Feel what you feel Park Hill 1-0-3-0-4
Rock caps til you can't take no more, it's war
Prepare for darts, martial arts
Let me shine keep me and mine, Son of Song
Took too long, back throwin darts, without remorse
Dart holocaust, slang boss
Remain top hip-hop, drop you to your knees for these
Big CDs, you heard it through the grapevine
Killer Beez

 (X2)
Everything is everything, reality
I keep my mind on everything, cause everything
Ain't always everything, and everything
That you see ain't reality, they just illusions


Face to face I break bread every time
In the world I hold mine, play it
Now check it, see if you can comprehend
These crossover rappers that lost they origin
Run from the Wu this time it's more trouble
I'm comin for the wreck so y'all could never bubble
Never concerned about rabbits, after my carrots
Cherryheads, and parrots
Won't live in the barracks, we Don Ho
Buckwild with the flow, how we do
Timbo's and full boot, vocabulary pitfall
Fuck all, more clothes than the mall
Let's brawl
Wu-Tang broke radio laws, the opposite of mines
Is yours, from sea shores to bankrupt
I conduct, erupt like Holyfield
Third seal, third chamber's from the hood
Branch out, and everytime you see Don
I'm up to no good... motherfucker
Splash that




I'm all alone, I feel trouble in the street
City heats, ghetto beefs, trick or treat
Call Chief, mad beef with MC's
Entity, Killer Beez one machine
Intervene, on scene self esteem
We gleam at night, it seems like
We too hype, hop y'all like checkers
Projectors, we break laws, get yours
We break jaws reunite, we upright
It's alright, out of sight, out of mind
It take time I develop, heads swell up
Shut the hell up, add on, you been warned
Mics get torn in half, I drop math
Don't laugh, a bloodbath with this here
Rap Shakespeare, beware, Donna-mite
Brown skin with the satellite, I represent
Buckwild and Street Life like 2 Cent
For real, for real
Love is love, for real, for real *overlaps chorus*




The other killers, have already shown up
Now it'll be your turn, to die too

We're ready anytime!




Uh... the pressure...
Uh, this means war, yo...


I wear a size nine in my dress shoe
Coincidently a nine's in my vest too, come and test two
Big guns, hammer cock, go
Mustang, yellow is banana top fold
Cristine pics, six mean whips
Three chicks, mother knowing, six mean tips
Rock a nigga crew, silly, boom bye bye
Black suits filling up the room, guy die
Blunt and dry tied, getting sky high
Lakers set a black code, doom side five
Blacks back 'em up, like a stocked up single
Cops packed 'em up, in his pocked up mingle
Old school, new school, need to feel though
Show, how I throw tool, niggas peel though
Aim to cook a nine up, and get an eight spazzled
Lame niggas sign up, and get your safe crashed though
Who is that man, Mr. Gat Man
Heat holding, do a nigga through his cat scan


Flame thrower, who to blame, and your name don't show up
Throw up, I'm blowing the dutch, my guns bust
And you fucking with the wrong nigga, I blow a nigga
Strong arm nigga, Vietnam nigga for sure
Ain't no chore for the thing that I got, twin Glocks
Forty five calo' slugs in hot rocks
Fuck the cops, and anybody try'nna stop my team
I rhyme hard for the love of the cream
My sixteens, ain't nothing to doubt, gun butt, up in your mouth
Real Life, up in your house
Fuck an ounce, I need ten bricks, alotta chips
Niggas think that they can pull my suits and do the steeze
You'se a bitch, son, I'm try'nna get rich, now break your self
Before I take ya health, it's gonna take a lot shoves to stop me
And I ain't rocking or dealing with none of ya'll
So respect these bars, or I'mma catch you at the park


We gon' live, die, get by, high
Before I take this in, I'd rather a chair and fry
Why, M.C.'s, always wanna try
Homicide Hill, nigga, eye for an eye


Aiyo, I touch down, clutch crown, I brought back the New sound
I see the circuses in town, you clowns
Automatic live rounds, spit for my crown
Living adverbs and nouns, my metaphors astound
Leap over crowds, with one single bound
If you need more, this the record store where it's found
Yo, the low light, lounge, nigga, ask around
Used to talk about me, now you wanna give my ass a pound
Who select you clown, let loose the hound
Fourth down to go, hit the hole for the touchdown
Shake down to slow down, your projects to a ghost town
Three mics, three strikes, new pitcher on the mound
Rumble every round, still get beat down
Your face lift is now pararrel to the ground
Catch me on the rebound, if you can
Mr. J-U-S, fucking your girl on candid cam'


Yo, I blow styles like Nikki Bonds blowing trial
Guilty of a filthy freestyle and foul language
Perfect strangers, mark this rap scene stainless
Without a blemish, spend this from start to finish
The mad chemist, create a rhyme like Frankenstein
Then energy ever line without the lying
We fertilize letters, bring words to life
Preserve the life, to burn all you parasites back biting
You hate hiking on my style, niggas wanna dick ride?
Play the gate up, stay wearing knee high
Might terrorize tracks, with terrorist traps
Ask someone real, if I was kept sealed
And if revealed, skills explode like Oklahoma
Put the spicy niggas in comas, sniff the aroma
The sweet smell of success, farewell to your flesh
My style's so sick it was put on bed rest
God bless, if you try to test my commitee
My hood is all good, but then again it's all even
I see you live a little stable, violate and shit'll turn fatal
Meet my trigger finger friend napal
Clown, you walking on shaky grounds
The shit's violent, and niggas bust lyrical rounds




Face the problems that everyone's found
We must replace what we took out of the ground
Face the problems that everyone's found
We must replace what we took out of the ground


The echo from machine gun rounds simmers
And a fallen soldier, his weapon hangs on his shoulder, lights get dimmer
Key swingin' back and forth in the ignition
The stench was only part of the horrible condition
As he waits for the smoke to clear
All he heard was the blast from in the bombs that kept ringin' in his ear
Along with gun-bearin' troops with fatigues and wearin' boots
From miles away, whether night or day they hear 'em shoot
It's a very unforgivin' and hostile environment
The military hardware, the only requirement
A world with a decease is just a thing of the past
Every advance is more costly than the last
The president's madness is responsible for losses
Political forces, land littered with corpses
Like the youth from the streets that gambled and get scarred
Even the troops in the field bet it all for one cause


Face the problems that everyone's found
We must replace what we took out of the ground


We grew up y'all, die-hard dummies, pourin' coke and guns
Violence was near so hallways were plungy
Dirty jean, hoodie on boys, stealin' stereos to get on
I did my first crime when I was born
Young king  realize
Life'll put you in a short spot, gun cocked, we was already signed
Day to day slingin', til once, we formed an ill line
Dynamic duos, all we did was threw O's
Police chased us in buildings, different places
This is real then, do me a favor, keep it from children
We was bad guys, stressin' for money
Regulate and start a strong clique, I was that nigga, don't forget
Time to time thinkin' 'bout time, little time left
Time piece is on, new Nikes, switchin' nines
In the buildin', pourin' out rhymes, don't let the cycle happen again
You might get trapped if you rewind




Staten Africa, move through the rat holes with the hunger
All the Jakes, look Archie Bunker
Scheme on your cracks, plot, and jump yah
I can't wait to get out, released from the barracks
So I can chop more , hunt gems
My army got lion's dens
See through your technology, advanced behavior
Renewal of the street mind, I speak mine
Little kids run through your hall, addicted to spray paint
Thugs clash with the unjust, it's untrust in these hallways
But love always, all of my dudes from back in the days
We 'place hard times with better ways
On some grown man shit, gettin' that child support paid
Never call out 
Mothafuck what you heard, it's the gods in here
Never slack on that music, it's very sincere






Yeah
Just puff something man
Get my mind right
From all of these crazy hood dreams
Yo eh yo now comeon


Master of Ceremony
I hate being around fake niggas
Thats mad phoney
Chicks ride the pony
Me and amar eat veggies
Its still boney
Most of the times I step in the spot
And niggas know me
I roll blunts
And I be smoking just like a roly poly
Alakazam, sham taught me not to eat ham
Bam bam up in the hood nobody eats spam
Alot of dimes and money
Fast as I can
Tax invasion tryna stop me from cashin in
We superstars in the game
Dangerous men
Whores dont really like me
But they fuck me again
Money chaser
Hope my lawyer beat the fucking case up
Pop off
Blast at everything until we make up
In the back of the car
On the dark route
Two indian chicks that like dark cock
I keep a  on my jock
Just like my name 


I play the game by the old school rules
You can rap the microphone if you dont pay no dues
And the rhymes so simple but you so confused
Got nothing going for you but your lyrics is hook
Yo, stay garbage, no pay homage
Hip hop wasnt designed for that nonsense
We here to regulate
Come out of conflicts
Told yall realness so get yall the knowledge (cmon)
Make you rap better
Elevate the  level
Compete the guards and things
Throw some patron 
Form shit outta nothin
Im saying get cheddar
Home of 400 or more
But yall dont know better
Its a science to the study, to the t
Success is nothing but the generation they achieve
So im weaving like the shoalin monk
From woo jing

Of any other mc


I can turn a hard block into a soft one
Internet can turn a hard rock into a broadband
 turn a hard rock into live round
Enemies, birds, hard shots that flaw ya
Hennessy and herb, hard shots and 
White bentley azure
Hard top like a milestone
Im a monster like kanye and nikki
Shit get like concreate when don shae hit the city
Cause im an older dude
Im old school
I can show proof
To my young boys
How to blow through moves
Man I learned alot
Never burned a rock
Selling night
Burn the block
But never burned the pot
Burning spot 12 12s
How you burn the spot
Murder plots
12 shells at the murder spot
I never heard of op
He never earned a spot
Turn this top convertible drop
When I 


My flow is so cold like Chicago
I know it all slow
But ps never off
Always on soul
Pay attention when I check back in
Snappin neck again
Business never personal
From long island to shoalin
Bring it back to the fish in the hat
And banging tracks
When it come to globetrotting
Been there, done that
Raising the cheech and chong
Doing a 100 meters on the autobond
Once again its on
Its the hip hop overlord
Overseeing the source
Birth the hiphop act
From the land of the lost
Screaming boss
Pmd still come with the force
Transmitting through satellites
How I stay on course

Brockhead (echoes)




Turn the track up a little bit
We need to rock in here

I wanna make you happy


I'm not at all happy or elated, this category ain't my favorite
It's my story, I'mma state it, you could love it or hate it
I'm just a misfit blessed with good dick and intelligence
Hood nigga holding no grudges on petty shit
I started, why are we cold-hearted, so guarded
Scared to get hurt, trying not to love the hardest
That's garbage, remember when we loved each other
Bathtub scrubbed each other, chillin', champagne spillin'
Uh, feelin' like the shit gon' last forever
Time went so fast, we had a blast together
Laughs we had, friends we spent time with
Now I be seeing your friends out, then I'm reminded
How we all used to gather up for the holidays
Now your friends all nervous to speak, they act afraid
I was your bestie, how it get to this
As I reminisce, takin' off my MJs in my empty crib
Mary...


I wanna make you happy
But you just don't see it
I wanna be around, babe
But I'm so tired of competing
We say all the wrong things
Till we make each other cry
What are we doing?
Will it ever get better?
My heart, my soul
I gave, it's yours
I can't get back
All the things that I lost
Boy, I love you
But you're pushing me away


I gave you everything that I got
Watched my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside


Now I was hoping
We'd get through this together
You said you'd love me
Through all types of stormy weather
Wasn't it you who said
We'd be together for all time
But it keeps messing with my mind
My heart, my soul
I gave, it's yours
I can't get back
All the things that I lost
I need you here near me
But I can't make you stay




I never thought that I would have this feeling
Do you think for once that you can truly mean it
Wasting so much time disagreeing
See, I'm to the point where I don't know what I believe in




If you don't want this, I don't want this, I do my morning crunches
Play my jazz, pray to the east, and watch the sunset
Uh, but yet I was blowin' you up the other night
Could tell your girl was telling you what to write back
Tell me why it's like that


So make up your mind, boy decide
We can't go on like this, this ain't right (it ain't right)
Feeling really bad, feeling kinda low
Think it's time to go






Feelings. The emotional side of a man, woman or a child's character. A response or tendency to respond. A belief, which can be vague, illogical, but mostly, irrational


I never gave a fuck on how the next nigga felt
I rocked a heavyweight belt cause that's the way I felt
Still feel, so inspired to write a rhyme that's ultimately
No other emcee could get with me, is way I felt
Don't forget the first time you heard me rhyme the way
The first time you heard "Protect Ya Neck", the way you felt
Like no other hip hop record ever made you felt
Cards dealt, played my handle, when no matter how I felt


Every time we touch the mic, you know our lyrics is felt
Worldwide, live, polaroid shit, all my homies is
And we ride out to all of our music is
Yeah, we gets busy, teach the youth  because we know how it felt
Give em Knowledge of self expressing in a way that it's felt
So each and every person to recognize what they felt
Watch your mind state because the evil could be felt
You never know, how when I first came out, how my brothers felt
I've been going through it, plus a lot of deep pain was felt
We would last for a night, but a better tomorrow


I felt the angel of death breathe
When I felt the four fifths something told me squeeze
I felt like it was the end of a dynasty
Like I was fighting a clique of five Chinese thieves
Karate slippers with slip on's so I kept slippin'
The floor was too smooth felt like I couldn't catch a grip in
Felt like Dragonfly Jones, was Dragonfly Tone
So I kept spitting, woke up when I heard the phone


I never gave a what on how the next rapper felt
I take that rapper's belt myself, I feel how Cappa felt
I don't really need help, use a sharpie, don't need the felt
Marker, walk on water, I see how Jesus felt
No rhyme or reason, just bleeding, my every breathing's felt
This about a thesis that even paraplegics felt
These boys ain't needing, they barely breathing, believe it, seen it
Till you got cheated, you couldn't tell me how cheating felt
I'm not a failure, I couldn't tell ya how losing felt
Might not have nailed her, but I can tell ya how spooning felt
Remember when you first heard the rap and the way it felt
I burned the track with a murder rap and I know it's felt






Yeah, man, the fire is the purification
I spit... energy.. no matter what happen yo, I gotta spit
Uh oh and I'mma do it for the team, I'mma spit...


Aiyo, I spit fire at you dudes until the die I retire
I'm doing this for my family, so that we can transpire
And reach limits that exceed doubt, yeah we can do this
But we gotta get up off this murder route
I'm on the block, momma love on the couch
And the pain is unbearable, the way streets keep steering you
In the wrong direction, I'mma need more thugs around you and more protection
And you still guessing, you don't know what life is about yet
I study and work hard for the set, I'm proud to be a doc
I'm not done, my mouth's like a tech, women wit me in the stretch
And the five burns from the way a man rep
Fire that'll burn at a man chest, energy that


I spit (fire)
You know I spit (fire)


I'm sweet flowing river, mathematics be the wisdom
Compound and we elements of sound, transmitted
Through the system of engineering
Technology allows me to transform
Words to sight, light is written
In five hundred seconds, since bitten and recited
A million black men united, from Shaolin
Medina heard the warrior call, we were everywhere
Already cocked and ready, one thought blew 'em off the planet
He can't stand it, head rocking, stadium shit
You know the champion, multiple armed subjects
Revolutionary techniques, please don't disrespect the projects
This is for the babies, and I don't want to have
Get ignorant and clap you
For nothing, we suppose to be brother and I other than self
It's the best part that sparks all things
Fire is in heavy rotation, all saying

 (x2)




These are the men who lead the crime families of America
I control 26,000 men
Except for dope, we operate in all aspects of organized crime. And if there's one thing I'm sure of
It's that drugs destroy your mind and destroy your home
In the end it'll only lead our country into ruin


We eat fish, toss salads and make rap ballads
The biochemical slanglord'll throw the Arabs
In the dope fiend, vocal chords switch laser beams
My triple sevens broke the slot machines out in Queens
Grey Poupon is Revlon rap, smack pawns, swing like batons
Most my niggas smoke like Hillshire Farms
Check the gummy sole, underneath my shoe lies the tap
That attract bow-legged bitches with wide horse gaps
In steel mills Iron he'll smoke the blow on duns
You run errands, Primatene Mist is afraid of my lungs
Turn my channel, it'll blow your whole bench off the panel
Like eighty roman candles that backfired then slammed you
Every day is like a video shoot, check this shit
I take it back to Playboy, stash guns in whips
Picture afro picks, shish kabobs and dashikis
Thousands civil marched, raised their fists in early sixties


Now check this one, you must have been stupid to miss this one
Donna shogun-ing flip a ton of fashion
Destination be the cash one, I step past one
Don't make me blast one, I'm cold like Eskimo floe
Cappa villain stay chilling take shots of penicillin
Clean out and let the steam out, she fiend to blow out
But I'm equipped with mad white, Morris The Rap got nine lives
I'll take a few hundred thousand dollar dives
And then I still never go down
Until the last round I shine
When RZA do his thing motherfucker, I'mma do mine


Now, where I come from cats be carrying, marrying drug money
Fuck up your wife, get four to life
Cream we handling, Midtown niggas scrambling
Move and examine the fly shit, plus quick to buy shit
Chef, yeah, you know the whole gods astral
Fidel Castro suits plus depositing cash rule
Big time, play it like Canadian wine
RZA's divine now, the sacredness of one's true mind
Now let's get colorful like money green
High roller coaster, Sosa, million dollar nigga roaster
Yeah God, be having my whole steez laced
Now let's rap a taste, connect dots, aim Glocks, train stop
Figaro fly jeweling, tri-color Cubans
Swerving with power Germans and Suburbans
Twenty-four niggas with vests on, my own restaurant
Dons sending my sons membership forms
And still getting this paper scraper
Fake gators from Jamaica, wizzes be passing like Lakers
And it be coming from Lex Louis Rich Liberace
Fetus style and blocking goals like hockey






Yo, (Wu) one two (Tang) one two (Wu-Tang)
It's the Wu (Wu-Tang) creepin in the shadows (Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
Sir I, Excalibur  (Wu-Tang...)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
Yeah

My rap style swing like Willie Mays
My eyes Purple Haze, my solar razor burn through shades
Rhyme grenades raid the airwaves, catch this rap page
I glide like, hovercrafts on the Everglades
Born master, with the faster blade, track slasher
Manufacture poems to microphones, bones fracture
Limited edition composition spark friction
Non-fiction, the calm bomb, keep your arms distance
Zero tolerance, dominant intelligence
Wu original, true colors step from the melanin
The most high, most try, to get close by
And overthrow I, but choke, with they hopes up high
I circulate the tri-state and vibrate beyond the Richter
Fly sistas flock when they spot this live nigga
The crowd seducer black your third eye before I lose ya
Verbal high, leave styes in the eyes of Medusa
Top ten, poly like Cochran, and Sharpton
Narrow margin, of your odds to dodge the marksman
Murder rap, kill you soft like Roberta Flack
Words attack like a British Bulldog, observe the stacks

(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)


Now all pay tribute to this entity
A spark that surges through the undergrowth
Overwhelming the populace from the entry
The Wu-Tang Dynasty, has emerged
From this elite fleet I was appointed to strike the vital nerve
Mouths tend to utter and speak empty words
Observe the magnetic attraction as we breathe
Seeds of MC's at these fake ass industry niggas
Feed off, the chrome mic tend to squeeze off
And spray, an array of shots
That travel downwind, just respect my prolific pen
As I send, the minds of the weak
To rise and take power I blew tower-ing over the land
As we stand, expanding our cream
A dollar to every grain of sand
Let the mind use the physical as planned

(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)



Yo, yo, this is Beirut
Try to comprehend check out my new suit
Gods blend aim take fire pure destruction
Disappear from here, my year, drop the stupid LP's everywhere
Fallin out the sky tall sniper
Raps by Cappadonna hit the countryside
Poetry whirlpool, RZA and True collide
We produce article exception to the rule
We the black men that struck oil, the hardboiled
Cats that made that Watergate thing go spoiled
The heavy-handed, locked down stranded with Cyrus
Wu Pirates, sneak inside the club, low eyes
Low down dirty, twelve thirty, night time crawlers
Off-the-wallers, basketball gun brawlers
Smoked out throw both fists for nine-seven
Slang reverend, put the best work in

(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)

(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
Yo
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)




Yo, uh huh
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang


You think I'm kinda crazy, but I gotta few regrets
Livin like a king, with a pocket full of grits
We come from different worlds, don't you ever forget
I'm just a poor little white boy, showin my respect


Like Willie Mays
My eyes Purple Haze, my solar razor burn through shades
My grenades raid the airwaves, catch this rap page
I glide like, hovercrafts on the Everglades
Boom master, with the faster blade, track slasher
Manufacture poems to microphones, bones fracture
Limited edition composition spark friction
Non-fiction, the calm bomb keep your arm distant
Zero tolerance, dominant intelligence
Wu original, true colors step from the melanin
The most high, most try, to get close by
And overthrow I, but choke, with they hopes up high
I circulate the tri-state and vibrate beyond the Richter
Flies sense to flock when they spot this live nigga
The crowd seducer black your third eye before I lose ya
Verbal high I leave stars in the eyes of Medusa
Top ten, parley like Cochran, it's often
Narrow margin, of your odds to dodge the marksman
Murder rap, kill you soft like Roberta Flack
Words attack like a british bulldog, observe the stacks




Now all pay tribute to this entity
A spark that surges through the undergrowth
Overwhelmin the populace from the entry
The Wu-Tang Dynasty, has emerged
From this elite fleet
I was appointed to strike the vital nerve
Mouths tend to utter and speak empty words
Observe the magnetic attraction as we breathe
Seeds of MC's at these fake ass industry niggas
Feed off, the chrome mic tend to squeeze off and spray
An array of shots that travel downwind
Just respect pyrhiffic pen
As I send, the minds of the weak
To rise and take power I blew tower-ing over the land
As we stand, expanding our CREAM
A dollar to every grain of sand
Let the mind use the physical as planned




Beirut
Try to comprehend check out my new suit
Gods blend aim take fire pure destruction
Dissapear from here, my year, drop the stupid LP's everywhere
Fallin out the sky tall sniper
Raps by Cappadonna hit the countryside

We produce article exception to the rule
We the black men that struck oil, the hardboiled

First off get them in the bed
Take they shirts off
(?) the weed and thizz
Honeys love me like this
Ice wrists and deep dish
Five 25th yo my swag is the compass
Black a proud, a nigga whatever I accomplish
Mama Hills son, I carry a real gun
But when I steal something catch all of my shells
Hardbody is the case, my brain's in the cell
My heart's like a prison
Yeah my thoughts is hell
I'm out here, I see the shit when I spark my L
I'm free now
I feel like I escaped from jail
I move like a wiseman making my bail
Governments plant fear in their mail
I don't fail
My thoughts stay fresh on my niggas that don't squeal
Papi (?), freedom mean more than a bitch
I'm going to grind hard all day and get these chips


I move with them niggas who shake dog
A couple of eight balls
And know when to shake them jakes off
Its late night so I gotta get cake dog
And tell a bitch I'll beat her girlfriend (?)
Ain't nothing to (?)
We could face off
And after that dude, I'm back getting that base off
If the drought come I cake off
And get money
Double up, sit in the truck
Lay low where its nice and sunny
Hold the blam down
I started thinking of self
Like this is my man's town
I'm on the regular
B-boy city mix
You niggas live
But this is how B-Easy get
I slide through with a crew that's Su-Wu
Hundred niggas on bikes out the one-six-ooh




Aiyo, I'm all fucked up, like them niggas in the struggle be
I look good on the outside, but got dust in me
I'm vexed, I spent all my life in the projects
You could never know what's next
Even though I rap, I could still go broke
Rob and sell coke
Doing life for catching a body, ain't no joke
Fuck dope, nigga, I used to sell crack
I hate to be like that, but it's real like that
I got locked up mad times in the Hill
I been to Fishscale, Mohawk, Sing-Sing
El Mira, Shock Two
So if you feel like me fuck me, then fuck you
Yeah...




Hook off 
Yeah


Yo this is for the niggas
Thats killin theyselves
Put hits out on each other
For the fame and the wealth
Got portraits of black devils
Reveal theyself
Thats so genocide shit
I seen it from before
I seen it with my third eye
That rap took a fall
Yo my spirit got involved
Souls were turned demon
Women got infected
And burned by the semen
I seen them posted up
Drunk on 
On they forehead
Was a mark thats no good
Brothers act like taking life
More than making life
The lord had to take away
Their hearing and sight
Like come on man
Hating on don
Cause I shed light
I just war with the mic
Id like to be more effective
Brothers should respect it
Forcing rap to get rejected




Hey yo Im still alive
But you prob I dead yea
Im redline, sports bra on the red vet
Im in the money race
A honey race
Is what you dummies chase
Choppin chunks of 
Up on my brothers plate
Bookin stacks at a lovely pace
Hustle on the boulevard
Cause I trust in god
When I hustle hard
This rhyme time
Tryna bubble like hot lard
Its crime time
And we  slime
You poptart
You rock hard
Like  zero
Layin berettas
Stash boxes with  and cheddar
My plan clever
A damn terror
Like al zackowi
Like scarface
Instead im blowing pounds in cali
Like baseball
I rush you know if you foul me
Shell cases and numbers down
Try to surround me
Too much luck
Cant pick it up with the bounty
My heads above water
But they tryna to drown me




Yo! Get away from the door
Everybody get the fuck back
Staten Island, stand up


I live a street life, nothin' but hard times and strife
I be stuck on the block try'nna make things right
Sold crack for a living, now I could write
Not just for the paper, for the sacrifice
Vibe with me, the cops come ride with me
I'm all in the hood, yeah nigga, slide with me
If the feds start lookin' for Don, survive with me
Experience my ill pain, the broke windows in the rain
Crackheads goin' insane
Marlo stuck dope in his vein, lift him up
Bodies in the back of the hood, stiffen up
It get ugly and shit, why it gotta be this?
We came a long way, fuck cheaters
We don't wanna bust the Heaterz
No speakin' on the phone, we don't trust receivers (yeah)
Park Hill be the real niggas and Don' Divas (it ain't over, it just begun)


Enough of your bullshit, my niggas'll pull quick
Berettas and full quicks, guerillas and convicts
Armed and dangerous, bombs and bangers, kid
Stormin' the game with it, calm but anxious and
I'll whip yo ass for this, come with the cash or it's
On with the blast and it's, gonna get hazardous
Niggas should know by now, niggas should know my style
Shaolin, hold me down, frontin', there goes the pow!


Why it gotta be like this
Police fightin' us with night sticks, niggas carryin' ice picks
Sometimes, niggas we do crimes, I ain't gotta tell you
Niggas throwin' up signs, niggas shipped to Bellview
Son, don't let coke dog smell you
Run if you packin' something, do what I tell you
Skate, nigga, never let jake nail you
I got caught up in the grind but I fell through
Now I'm back on the spot, keep my eye on you
Make a phone call, kid, or put a spy on you..
And this is dedicated to all my niggas in the ghetto
Big dimes and C Rule, jugs of Palmetto
I'm in too deep and I just can't let go
Catchin' my pain, real niggas that respect dough




It's my world!
Fucked up... stick 'em! Ugh..
2-4, Graveyard Shift
(The names and the faces have changed
But the game, is still the same...)




I'm like the phantom of the opera, last of the lobsters
The trees from the rasta, the smoke at the Oscars
Blaze at the Emmy, yo fuck the nominees
Starving artist, nigga, who spittin' rhymes like these
Please show me, youse a nigga 'pared to Kobe
Obi-Wan Kenobi, Bevery Hills, ask a foley
Fast or slowly, I leave your shirt holy
Or push a 500 like co-d, life acapulc-ky
Now ya'll niggas playing low key
Be the fake baller, and that pussy broad owe me
Rap trophy, got it, in every fucking lobby
Hit you up, my product, and we gotta split the profit
Put a record out, and I'mma stop it
West in the bank, I got it, KJ drop
Nigga cop it, I ain't got too much more to tell you
Bring ya Rambo life to Park Hill gun play
Act gay with features, and your punch lines
You want, permanent punch time from Optimus Shine
We the guidelines, promatic, calling you back
And let the world know, who taught you how to rap, you hear that?


One, two, three-in, lump out your chair
Three, five, seven, me'll leave out your hair
It's no use, call the cops nigga, know it's loose
All I'm leaving them is pulp, playing no juice
Empty out the safe, and it's condiments
Nine caught 'em til, sun light shine through 'em
Son school 'em, I order more rounds for ya
Oreo's with a little short sound for ya
Excuse you, why you steppin' to the don, for?
Gat palm, crack longer than an encore
Free and bust, try to indict, me and Crush
Cheese cops, cuz I'm in oh-deep, got
Comcast, love the way I harm tracks
Put you out there, know we got contacts
Cap peeled, tell me how that blast feel
That steel, got 'em laying in his last meal
Bezzy, vest make me look top heavy
Don't wonder on the war, you are not ready
Listen how I abuse tune, leave a body in ya backpack
It's gotta be a boom-boom


Mr. John Machanro, pass the dough with a fast flow
Fidel Castro, with the lasso, roppin' you 'victs
It's portable, sick of the Source, I'm rip 'em off
From long range, scum stains on your corpse
Fear, now get in, where I fit in, stay fitted
Real Life means real living, Any Give Sunday
It's a gun day, one way
I'mma pay ya all back someday, dum dums spray
I can walk the walk, and talk the talk
Fifteen downs in the State of New York
Fucking ya whores, ya'll here suck on tour
I'll be waiting down south with a nine into your bulge
Rhymes pour, since alotta shit change in the game
I'mma re-arrange, mask style, things ain't
Gon' be the same, Homicide range
Real Life, nigga, respect my name


Yo, only the strong survive in this wild world of raps
Where pussy cats bunt for my rockwell raps
You can't hack this criminal style of combat
That came through, got 'em and drew on horseback
Raw hide's the way I rip guys, and then slide
Roll up and snatch yo shine, like it's mine
Yo this mine, nigga, like the thoughts from my mind
Slid your river side, like the crimson tide
You out your line of scrimmage, I'm blind to your image
Bust nuts on yo hype, all night til I'm finished
This not what we finished, I hold the world record
For knocking off eight M.C.'s in twelve seconds
You flirting with a loaded weapon, that splittling backs
Like a mack eleven, while you blastin' yo gats at heaven
I'm living like you owe me something, but really
You don't owe me nothing, I'm taking everything coming
Call me selfish, and I leave you helpless
Rotate two, and predict your pelvis
I smell shell, hit these rap niggas out there
Sniffin' in my kitchen like it's cooty in the air
You'll find nothing here but, hard rock niggas
Hard cock niggas, rob-ya-block niggas
Peel your ho niggas, steal your dough niggas
And when I blow nigga, I'm bringin' more niggas




Yeah (yeah) what we do (come on Dini) huh? (1-6-Ooh)
Yessa yessa my lord (Park Hill Productions, the mic'er son) faggots
(Uh let's do this, turn it up, yo)


If you see us on the block getting paper
Chump, you better bet we got that thing on our waist
And if you niggas don't think that it's major
Then we'd gotta shoot you right dead in your ---


Sometimes I feel like the whole world was built around me
I used to sell crack until this music shit found me
The streets remain deep, but not deep enough to drown me
New York chop it up, get it cooking like ground beef
When me and Lounge put it down, baby, it sound sweet
We worked hard for this for shit, putting in work
It didn't take long for us to put our foot in the dirt
New York City of dreams, glamorous, iced out
Fly whips with the fly crib, chicks on the couch
Skyline, city of hopes, American lifestyle
We ain't waiting for that gwop, we wanting it right now
Fuck being broke, I wanna live like a white child
My slums bust gun, base let go and white owl
Forever on the grind, suck pussy and get paper
Cell phone, two-way pager, all my niggas stay major
Like Comrad, bombing the tracks like Arabs
Money for grabs, let's get it, New York fitted
Sliding out the door with a bit-itch
Tell your wifey don't snit-itch, let's get rit-ich
Tell 'em Diggeler did it, that's how I love to spit it




You might see on the six train, riding the subby
Along some bad Puerto Rican chicks, and none of them ugly
Staten Island's Most Popular Son, do what I do
Fuck licks, I got chips and I carry a gun
I told the Don to hold me down, I got some shit to finish
And this is Blood Brothers 2, without counting the minutes
One, the take-out food, I break your dude
And have your daughter raped in school, after I ate your food
I like the pen, but I hate the grooves, hate niggas
Who talk shit, and like they wanna trace my moves
Like where I'm coppin' the hard at and how much grams cost
The mayor of my block, I've been holding the damn torch
You see he go, it's BZ Mode
With a Yes Lord, Yeah Man, easy flow
Times up, rhymes up, man, CD gold
I take it back to the Ooh and get one sixty dough






I was born and raised, in the ghetto
I was born and raised, in the ghetto
I was born and raised, in the ghetto
Listen to me, and just lay up


Park Hill Projects, one eight pound
Holding it down, that's the motto, 'lo goose and lottos
Blunts on the regular, O.G. style
I'm into old V's, swinging in cabs, slinging them OZ's
All I know is running in fiends' labs, hitting the green bags
Visualizing Chef in the green Jag's
Wait til I get on, the haters gonna hate it
In this corner, a rich young don with a crisp lab


*humming*
Brother, listen to me
Brother, listen to me
Listen to me, and just lay up
How do you make your bread in the ghetto?
How do you make your bread in the ghetto?


Hustling, hustle & flow
We make bread in the ghetto, by selling that crack
See niggas that make bread by busting the gat
Might stick a nigga up, stab him dead in his back
It's a dirty bread game, but we get through them stacks
Bread game, rather have bread than fame
Some sell pills and weed, it ain't no joke
Might sell anything as long as we not broke
So if you getting that bread, we be coming for your throat
It's crazy what a brother might do for the bread
Might violate parole til ya family is dead
We get bread in the ghetto, while we ducking the feds
I heard bread in the ghetto got a loaf on his head, come on


Brother, listen to me
Brother, listen to me
Listen to me, and just lay up
How do you get rid of rats in the ghetto?


Yo, yo, aiyo we ox 'em, duff 'em, stuff 'em in black bags
Torture them, toss 'em out the window with rift rafts
Cuz we don't take kindly to rats in the ghetto
Either your mouth stay shut or get slapped with the metal
Big fat rats get fried like porkchops for snitching
Get your ass hung like a wall clock
It's Tone Stark, Billy the Kid when the gun bark
A wire sticking out his shirt, he talking to NARC!


How do you raise your kids in the ghetto?
How do you raise your kids in the ghetto?
Feed one child and starve another
Tell me, tell me, and just lay up


We like brothers, we came from the same mothers
In the projects, under the same covers
Wore the same drawers, fucked the same whores
Rolled dice, kicked rhymes, did crimes in the same hall
Sprayed our names on the same wall
Yo, your kids knew my kids, your wiz knew my wiz
Now you caught up in music and showbiz
If that's what it is, then that's what it is
Run up in your crib, with twelve black brothers
That'll digest to live, die just to live
Some called us martyrs, some called us fathers
Run up in the club like the suicide bombers
We be the brothers, ready past lovers
Never wanna see us, blow, we not others
Somewhere in the competition, friends got lost
The money got flipped, your tables got crossed
Now you all caught up in that label talk
Brain dead in the grain of thoughts
With a name and a game that can change New York
We ate from the same fork, pop had the same thought *echo*



 I got into another fuckin fight with my nigga today
 See what I'm sayin? Niggas ain't shit
Especially them project niggas
 For real, peep those niggas right there
 What you mean?
 That nigga right there, that six foot night right there
Tossin his fuckin nines like he's the Don
 Nah, nah, nah, shorty right there


Girlfriend, what you did was wrong
Baby my love is still strong
On some King Kong ding-dong
Never celebate, never souflan
Poppi kin, poppi wardrobe king
Suck her G-spot, and you know she so hot
She said she love me a lot
Remedy, she told me she drop
Fuck her so hard, all outdoors
Pussy is mines and plus yours
Didn't mean to turnin em out, turnin em on
Stetched out in front the next girl house
BB dick out, Remedy, slash Cappadon'
Slash pardon me for turnin you on
Turnin you on


Girlfriend
BB conduct, BB conduct, BB conduct
Didn't mean to turn you on
BB conduct, BB conduct, BB conduct


Check that yo, fuck what he thinks
You know the pussy bleeds and stinks
Buy ya tranked out, blanked out, all crazy in pink
I seen the pussy kill the best of men and take down kings
Fuck material things, fuck ya phat diamonds rings
Men do lifetime bids for this, 2 lips hit the clitoris
Inconspicous, hit with Syphilis, ridiculous
One gash, came between the man and the stash
Half his cash, sucker for love ass
Souflan, no doubt, was never in the plan
Ball-and-chain, pussywhipped man can't understand
It's like the Cappadon said
MCF means you thinkin with ya head
If you thinkin with ya dick son, ya might get sick
Cuz when it comes to the piece son, ain't shit for free
Either pay for every piece of it or start a family
Now all rise and eyes on the prize of this song
And if I did I never meant the girl to turn you on


Sellin ya gold, sellin ya soul
You crossed out, and crossed over
Gold digga and Hilfiger, booster and strippa
Flip on a nigga too quicka
Projects, is what I deal wit
Cold-hearted chicks catch on fast
Twist they ass, take more cash, and more crack
Tishy on the block, like bitches never do that
I protect females that fuck me on the first night
Bitin my spray nozzel, see Goines
Turnin y'all ladies, off and on, popcorn
Freddy Kruger, thoughts of how I'm gon' do ya
Ya mind all screwed up, BB conduct
All of y'all girls are outta luck
Takin too long, givin ya shit up
BB conduct, BB conduct, BB conduct, BB conduct

Chorus to fade w/ variations


Turn you on..






Stay ya'll, atonement, this one is for you, yes sir, a-yo


A-yo, I grab flows and throw 'em wit a twist of the wrist
I throw one inside your house like a Christmas gift
I'm the reason why these MC's be changing they flow
Cause every time I spit mine, they can't get no dough
Now y'all rappers pay attention, y'all don't know what it is
You just tearing the blocks down and shooting at kids
You not a thug to me now, and yeah, I know your type
You just wild to ya self, you not wild in the club
You wit your boys all the time, like a homo thug
You ain't never wit the honeys, you don't get no love
You make music for these assholes that be on the block
I make music for the world, just to bring up my stock
Come on y'all, y'all don't really know what it do
I drop jewels in your head like it's Purell shampoo
Martin Luther King & Malcolm X, Don' and Baby U
Spit the gospel in our rap, take brothers to church
Y'all taught 'em to sell crack, but we show 'em they worth
Wu-Tang music, this is how it suppose to sound
Y'all keep picking up the hood, while you putting us down
God is is love, come on, y'all


Come on, God is love, everybody say God is love
Come on, y'all say God is love
God is love, love, God is love, love


Gotta change my ways, my mother warned me
Calmly'll speak, time to air my dirty laundry
Angels that guard my body, lord, I'm sorry
Lord, I'm sorry for the things I did
It's strange out here, we bang out here
Killas, drug dealers, they hang out there
Cold stares, we don't care, we braid our hair
Lord, they hate out there, and there's jakes out where
Got plan to escape, they fake out here
Yea, they snakes out here, full of lies and deceit
Yea, they take out here, son died on his feet
Son cried in his sleep, can't forget his past
He lost a glass ring, just to flip some cash
He cried on the visit, his daughter kissed the glass
I need your blessings, but I missed the mass
I changed my ways, gotta shift the math
I picked my path, my wrongs is right
I used to hustle to the morning light
Then I found out, son, that there's more to life
They focused, indeed, my songs is tight
And survival of the fittest, with all my might
Got my legs and my brain, and all my sight
No more grief, and my teeth is white
And I never give up, and I keep the light

 (x2)
Come on, God is love, everybody say God is love
Come on, y'all say God is love
God is love, love, God is love, love


Hurses past us, demos, cast in stained glass windows
Pubes, pools of baptism, views of black victims
I snooze, catch visions of a beautiful world
No funerals, God musical, unusual pearls
Then, after it's judgement, then after the blood rips
Off of body and soul, we like Marcus Garvey in the godliest robes
And I awake from the sound of organs
The sound of families mourning, fallen grabbing his coffin
Will he fall or carried by the Lord wings
Absorbed in all the evil, that we do as the youth
So we, teach 'em the truth, you, teach 'em to shoot
Eve, ate out my fruit, then she, ate at my loot
Now we, pitch on the stoupe, til we rich in the coupe
Then someone snitch, you're found stiff in your boots
You need lessons, brothers, while I predicted the booth
Proverbs is truth, so who you listening to?

 (x2)
Come on, God is love, everybody say God is love
Come on, y'all say God is love
God is love, love, God is love, love




Yeah, Goon Skwad, we will not be oppressed
Revolutionary rap, holla, ahhhh
Don't get it twisted, thou shall stand up
Goon Skwad hold it down, ahhhh


Goon Skwad, real niggas that represent, it's the
Goon Skwad, bitch niggas, best to repent, it's the

Goon Skwad, yeah nigga, we coming right, it's the
Goon Skwad, hand grenades, ready to fight, it's the
Goon Skwad


Don't you ever get it twisted, when we
Walk in the club with that, shiny biscuit
We come in peace, for whoever, wanna kick it
It's the Goon Skwad, peace to Ruff Ryders, they down shifting
And pop them gears, fall back on they knees, and make it
The cops be coming round trying to get my goons a ticket
It's the Goon Skwad, when we in the spot, them games be doing things
Getting my niggas, lick a shot and you might get shot
Some people be falling down, trying to get to the top
Them devils be wanting you to stop, giving you praise
Make us a lot, what you gonna do when you find yourself left on the block
Goon Skwad, it's the Goon Skwad, ahhhh




Major figure niggas don't play that shit
We back to munching, we kill and spit, we like them thongs
And them bras be on them chicks, Benzitos and them Hummers
And spoiler kits, Nikes and fitted hats, how them ballers get
Women be shaking they ass, flashing they tits
Niggas be fronting and stunting, making you ball your fists
In trouble with them Bloods and Crips, put depot niggas
And them niggas who be slinging bricks, VD up in them time
My niggas don't ever slip, fuck around and get your face whipped
Goon Skwad, hit me on the hip, ready to flip
Coming hard, it's the Goon Skwad, Goon Skwad, it's the Gooon Skwad, ahhh






Yeah, for my peoples in the struggle (what it do, yeah)
East to west, worldwide (come on, Fat Albert, the slick hat)
Yeah, we love it (hold on to my bracelet)


I gotta find a way like grandpops with six kids
Through the jungle, like them old heads, doing life bids
Cuz life is, both destiny and karma


I keep beefing with my baby momma
And foul jakes to, giving me drama
All my life, yo, it's nothing but problems


So I gotta find a way to solve 'em
Remove the stress from my brain
Cuz there's gotta be a better way
To maintain the hit on the block, pushing cocaine


Cracks and all that, I gotta find a way to fall back
My ribs is touching til my record label call back


So I work and focus hard and try to stay on track
With a bullshit security job and CDs in my backpack


Bags of dope up in my ass crack, earth is in the backroom
Broke vacuum, I smoke my moon
It's the Better Life Movement, coming soon, uh
Return of the Pillage


I love my babies, I love my ladies
What love is this, for money
Streets shot, police on blocks
Keep hot, I love money


Shit on my new kicks, dirt on my Yankee fitted
We in the cock pitted, it's broke windows, on the whip, man, the cops did it
Gotta find a way or else the block's gon' get it


The weapons on my coat smelling like weed smoke
Sippin' like Bacardi Gold like the fork in the road
Noodles in the pot on the stove, been walking these feet
With years, look at my wounds
In the gutter, still paying my dues


Return of the Pillage
Garbage cans, squeezing the box
Raccoons be at the door, they live with a fox
Incense be burning hard, for the smell of the socks
We on the rooftops, looking for cops
Half a gallon of milk and a box of Pops
What up, ock?


Ya'll don't see what I see
Sometimes you misunderstood me
The dramatic cross street blues
Let a lot, see my dues


Ain't no characteristics in this shit (baseball hat, baseball hat)
Straight bongo, my doola, it's the foundation




Knowledge is the knoalition, also too respect
Knowledge is the foundation of all things in existence
Such as the sun is the foundation of the solar system
And the Asiatic black man is the foundation of his family


It's nice to be important but it's even more important to be nice
"Got to find a way" -] some kids


That's my word, check one, check two

Donna makes one sacrifice, what?
Started to change when the days got strange
No more hand-to-hand, strictly campaigns
It's all economics, hard times and trick-knowledgy
Champagne, caviar, psychology
Practice to be me, strivin for equality
Buildin, I believe the children like Whitney and Walt Disney

"Got to find a way" -] some kids

Uh, uh, it's like that y'all and you don't quit
Shit that make you fall in love with it

Chorus 2X


In the Days of Our Lives we could all feel the pain
When all of this children trapped in the game
Playin hookie from school, just ain't the same
When the guns get bigger, I worry 'bout the kids
The knucklehead ones with the elevator, bid
Trapped in America, it's hard to escape
The Projects, life is like the Planet of the Apes
When all of these kids be buggin wild off the tapes
It's your mindstate shorty, tellin you to be late
Do your homework kid, keep your mind out the dirt
You're only eighteen and you don't know who you hurt
I love you like a little brother, here's a razor
Carry that wise son, treasure what I gave ya

Chorus 2X


Long time no so, long time suffer
As the days get tougher, rougher on Don
I wanted help but first let me help myself
Have a care of my family, black libarian lady
Run right beside me, no public assistance
Long distance, I touch man, woman and child
Diet and stretch, architect with the finesse
Chain heat, brain stained with the horror
I'm a father of two, Wu Killa Bee lethal
I worked hard for mine, intwined up inside
Energy junkie, fertilize this twice, enough spice
I teach Lo, say no to drugs, say yes to more money
I'm a Transformer when your days get sunny
I'm your number one performer, pray for the all time great
Take a toast if you love Ghost, I'll be there
Beware, take caution, often I've seen these streets are gettin mean
Less rest, put the whole world to a test
Try to survive, archive five, strangle with lies
Last days of the hive, it's the Second Coming
I'm a secretary of Wu, official article post up
More dictionaries, read heavy notes, both coasts come together
Never be blind, protect all of mankind

Chorus 4X

"Got to find a way" -] some kids (to fade)




Yeah, yeah, summertime, New York City, stand up
Staten Island, stand up, whoo, yeah, it's a beautiful thing
Gotta bring the colors out now, I got the Nikes
The new things, two bangers, shit is banging song
Ah, yo, yo, yo


I'm in the hood once again, and I'm loving the vibe
All my veteran muthafuckas, we be keeping it live
Even down on G-Street, we be sick with the highs
You niggas is growing up now, they slick with the five
This kid got shot yesterday, Tamik died
Yo, my projects is warm, but it's cold on the outside
I'm still in the building, I live like I'm homeless
Though I love my children, so we reunite once again
I'm a lifeless feeling, yo, love for my fans, bring spiritual healing
With the wisdom, to manifest the best, I feel blessed
Living in the place where I call my rest
Piss in the elevator, shit on the steps, help you appreciate your last breath
What's up next? Call me collect
Yo, Staten Island, Wu-Tang Forever and we paid our debt


As the night shine, and the people slept
I came back in the game, I paid my respect
Growth and development, bought me a check, yo, my mind is set
As I sat by the window, and I find my texts
Yo, my cab popped off, I got more assets
And I love my seeds more than I cash my checks
God save me... whoo... hook up with Don'


Dog, I'm from the same damn place where the Wu was built
Where 2 Cent, Rakio and Boo Boo was killed
Same hood where them crooked ass cops killed Kase
And the judge don't do shit but smile in your face
For the world, why should I, the only way I'mma get drafted
Is by them baskets, playing ball til I die
Temperature's, I rapped though, never had a jumpshot
Fourteen years old, pro basing for one Glock
Focus on the fortune and the fame, the glamour and the glitter
Here now, I ain't joking with you lames
The money was the first love in my life
Fell in love with law, but look at Todd G like my wife
Been a long time, I'm getting it right
In a better position, an opportunity to better my life
Freestyle, better off when I write
I'm a lyricist, you one hitter quitter
Like Whitney and Mike, the rebirth, now we getting it right
Hue Hefna, Cappadonna, Q-Dini flow
Spitting it right, yeah




Why them blind eyes think they can see, what's really happening?
Build with the O.G.'s, Dini, Donna captain
Y.G., Louie the God, swift and changable
Dance with the wolves, but yet, we still remainable
I rep peace, don't eat red meat, like beast
When the beef's all over, still the truth be speak
Put away the heat, teach on peace, move by feet
Walk across the hot desert, your style is weak
Number 7, old two step, that's what it do
It's the hood classic, like a barbeque
Misunderstood too, like the God son do
Saying whose who, stay focused, but do you
Even though I move different, I respect the Wu






Yo, Check it out yall, Yeah
And you don't quit, Yeah, I keep rocking on
Keep rocking that shit till the crowd is gone
Poppi Wardrobe King, The suits and ties
The connect down in Baltimore, Pounds and pies
Bids in the city jail, Plus the state bids
Child support wars, Crazy kids
Cab driver with the black Range, Better Life nigga
Theodore Unit, Down with Trife nigga
You might see me in the hood chilling with a white nigga
Pushing something big with a tight insignia
I'm a Wu-Tang reject, Special Ed with the pen
Tore Tokyo down, Got my yen
Disappear off albums and I fade off pictures
Always getting stuck with these stink ass bitches
Mad styles, Niggas is jealous
Jumping all on my dick like a frank with relish
I bleed pellets, Spit sperattic
Crack a nigga cabbage open, Leave you stroke'n on the mic
Darts lop sided and broken, Niggas is Hoboken
Soho, Hoiten, Skimahorns at the top of they head
I'm the last one to get that bread
Jay Bird, Bags of herb, Coke, Crack, Dust
Back of the bus, Back out of the cuffs
Back in your wifie's butt
Six-three ACG's, Valor's and stuff
Keep grinding til my head hurts, Tours is ruff
Whores never get enough of the team
You better protect that neck motherfucker when you get that CREAM


Ayo, My turban is tight like, Selassie I the first
Better yet like Sizzler Calungy
I grab the mics and then I bungy
A lot of yall niggas ain't grungy


One, Two, Yo Cap my style is crusty, Like Sicilian pie square sliced
Understanding Power God Muslim, Son I'm nice
I left my kufi in your cab, Here's your turban
This is my philosophy like I sample Weldon Irving
Rappers know that wack compared to King Solomon
Not grundy, I more grungy then an age infected dungy
All we got in common, Venus, Birth, And methodology
Giving all you dumb thugs a model for your psychology
World traveler, Cryptic script unraveler
The predictor, A Psalmist, A dead rapper embalmist
Joe Cotton, My tongue's symbolic to a dagger
Jay Bird you built a house that sheltered many of swagger
A lot of these cats they lack the pain in they voice
The fuck you been through, Yeah I was homeless, And Planetless
But never ever poemless, Or talentless
I made a compact with God to expose your cowardness






Oh shit, look at them, they running on foot
They picked the car up, they on some Flintstone shit
Oh shit... and them niggas stuck together
On some Siamese shit... yo


Yo, classic murders, slick gun material
Burnt up bodies that rock with no burial
Hammers that hardly work, go to work
Like a slave on a hot day, with no water
Blow you for props, in the cop's face, might get knocked up
Jakes that play hero, they can get popped up
Face fallin' off they cheekbone, gotta take meat
From they ass, to sow it back, I'm a beast, holmes
It's ground beef, in the streets, so we street's clone
Like fresh fruit, from a tree, so the heat's blown
Your momma missing, your boys are crying
Cut ya balls out your nutsack, the chinks are buying
Shit bags is like gift bags, you get it for free
If you master fronting, classic cutting
You keep stunting, them gem star'll rip something
Look homey, it's the bloody sweepstakes
Glove club you down in the club, how you like that, sweet cakes?


Yo, it was a minute after twelve, when the tragedy struck
Niggas emptied on son, and left 'em leaning right in Valerie's truck
The red Cherokee blood was pouring out his head heavily
The only motive for murder was wetter, either jealousy
The found him slumped over the wheel, horn blowing
Bullet holes showing, property stolen, motor still going
Driving side door, waves scoping, the window is broken
Glass back and shredded his grill, his collar was soaking
He probably knew the killas, cause they jinxed him with ease
Cops hold the perimeter, thirsty, looking for leads
Knocking on doors, questioning tenants, the lieutenant
Was the first to arrive on the scene, he knew he was finished
DeWayne Roberts knew him in college, mid-twenties
Stopped being brolic, V.A. driver's license in his wallet
The last call on his mobile phone was back to home
Sorry, Miss Amonia's son was found dead with two in his dome


This be the bird's eye view of things, look how we doing things
We stick niggas up and we take they rings
Mission Impossible, Theodore Unit, we unstoppable
Spit razors out of our mouth and start chopping you
Bank robbers, blood jakes out with the obstacle
Ropes hanging down from the roof, my parachute
Soaking water, heat smoking, we scrape and we Pillage, man
Wherever we broke in, Theodore, pulverize
Boat rides and tours, smashed 'em in the crib with they coconut straws
Dudes step off the scene, black face and four-four
The CREAM that we stack up, cake and whores


Cash in abundance, the cats that I run with
Got gats at a motel, and splashed by the hundreds
I don't ask if I want it, my attitude is running
I don't ask if I want it, my attitude is running, yup
Mega ice neck, with some fish, with some fish dishes
Rakim gems, my mind shine is what my weight misses
Anything else is uncivilized, send the kind of niggas
A tremendous spy, you can see the venom by
My nine leave a ten to buy, I don't need my men to ride
I'm in the moshing squad, beside the car that's highly energized
Been advised, before, that fucking with I, is genocide
Many men have died, from playing games from what they feel inside
Brawl with it in me, put it on my enemy
Be warned, defending me, like killing off a Kennedy
I silly song M.C.'s get sent on base
Type of nigga spit the Remy or laugh in ya face
This dig in my waste, is mastery, step out of place
Shatter that ass, like glass, and break fast like a neglige
Play with the biscuit, dick, don't even risk it
I, snatch up my misses, and dash on the interstate




Hang glide for my nigga Tical
Yo, word to God we run this whole shit Son (no doubt)
Right that's my word, guaranteed you're dealing with the invincible (no doubt)
(I'm specialized in swordsmanship)
That's my word, Persian Legacy one time, one time
That's the science of the black man
Stationary niggas, have fun on this right here
Yo Shorty cross your arms
Gonna rock niggas to sleep this year (throw your leather up)


Blade thrower, sword swinga, killa bee ringer
Rocky road roll dark greener
Cream fademas, name your God-U Kareema
Shout out Medina, federaloes Noxzema
Me, jewelery cleaner Million Man March screamers
Ray Catena, cut your joint Wolverine
The Longines, wrapped around the wrist, law seen her
How I got that yo, threw out the macker named Gina
Bust a shot, seen her, it richocheted, tapped Tina
Now I'm out, lampin in Korea with Talima
We moseyin, sweatsuit Adidas, best believe
I got the black heater little joint, probably Moschino
Yo Bobby Robby whattup, Max tried to follow me
Sadaam loungin, clean up collect, like the laundry
It's time yo swerve like the Nike line
Windbreaker Laker throw a jump shot scrape her
Statuary yo floatin that snatch-uary
Aiyyo, blow a hole in your limo, weed pass the dutch


Yo this is MC wizardry, killa bee invasion
Men of respect, blessed with wisdom of the ancients
My words are blatant, lacerate necks for statements
I launch like lead projectiles, straight out the basement
I suplex your rep, left ruined like the Aztecs
Parasites, double edge dice your larynx
My hip-hop, is quarantined locked inside the detox
Under key lock, it's like b-block and E-Glocks
You're ill, your trail ends, thoughts are frail
I strike the cypher, and let one survive to tell the tale
Of my state of grace, I raise the stakes on snakes
Knock em off like the big eights for takin up space
Never did fear em, stick em with the truth serum
Who sent em, arrest em before my charge is ended
Designated hitter flows split the transistor
Kinetic globes light when it shine, burns your retina
Urban journal, plus eternal broadcaster
Before and after, I be Self Lord And Master


I be the Ironside, get touched, with the chloride
Take walk with the Nine-Finger bandits worldwide
Shaolin hillside, full of homicides
FUCK you dissatisfied the double dyed black brown iodine


Yo, box talk sequence, powerhouse kickout
Eyes dusty, wet, butt-naked with my dick out
I'm direct, golden best, golden chest is blessed
Scarce chapter, snatch a batch of Winterfresh
It sound farfetched, mountain men that be rich
You get buckshot, dummy-clapped, mummy-wrapped and stitched
The Jeffrey Dahmer Notre Dame-r sing the song the strongest
Brute force bullethole straight through your chorus
Shank you with the think tank, harmony cake cut
A can of ass-whoopin', Flurry shake break, you fucks
Struck, love crooks, why for lyin hooks
Chef cocaine cook, a marvelous book
This deathbed doctrine, paper for the youth
What remains, a saber-toothed tiger in the booth


Last night, I took a trip down to Crown Heights
Fast life, females are trife, stay tight
I detect that parasite, satellite
RZA beat makes me wanna fight get hyped, come to do shows
My slang sound write secretary type
Backflip on the mic, I'm the poor black man
Workin hard for the grand, I understand clear
Don't fear, peep my new gear it's different from yours
My style drop like drawers, you see me on tours
Don't you wait to say peace, the kid from the street
Put my technology on the track, just then the core attack
Wu article, Cappa, five, CD attack
But my talk stage live killa beehive
Bermuda my life angle, rectangle gold fronts
Bring the gold bangle, never make me throw darts
Check out my arts, when I release my smarts
Hot like Pop Tarts, aim me at the charts




Help the Brovas

These streets is flooded with crime and criminal minds
Niggas dump on ya'll, straight take ya shines
Catch you coming out the crib, straight raid your spine
Stab you on in side, straight take ya nine
Niggas'll kill muthafuckas for a bottle of wine
So where you put the heat at, caught on the blind
Here today niggas, better have a good time
Gone tomorrow, that's how it is in the grind
So beware of the dog, and the thieves at night
Niggas'll cut you up, if the trees ain't right
All of the Gods building, the degrees is tight
Cock back my headphones, then I squeeze them right
Yo, niggas'll kill niggas for the cheese and ice
And ya ribs start touching for the peas and rice
All of my in-the-ghetto niggas want G's and bikes
That's why I need my cake, and more Cash Rule like Land-O-Lake
I ain't try'nna be the one, just linger a zoo
I wanna be out in a cruise, living good as you
Up in the Bronx, or whatever, just me and my crew
And we lounging real hard, uptown's is new
Got the jeans real baggy and the fitted is blue
Traveling across the world, like alakazoo
Alakazaam, ya muthafuckas know who I am
Throw my darts like I told you I can
Yeah baby, big Donna from the group is, Pillage for life
Click, and I lounge where the stoupe is


Yeah, it's basic dog, we all in this game to ball
I leave my mark in your hood, like I'm writing on walls
Come ride my balls and tell yo, bitch to come here
I'm hitting 'em where, from the rear, pulling they hair
Layin' the pipe, my forty-five game is tight
I'm like a weed plant, nigga, I stay in the light
On dark grounds, gun percussion hang over tracks
I lay low on street corners, while I'm handing out packs
Counting the stacks, while the feds, counting the facts
Your glitter attracts, like I ain't that, nigga get clapped
Guess whose back, Ratchet, the rap specalist
A profession is my conscience'll, leave you breathless
I drop lessons with street knowledge, hold my ground solid
Watch me own back, I'm big, black and brolic
Hitting hood with the collard green, weed from the Phillipines
Cutting competition off with the guillotine
What, the cuts in my chain is unbreakable
You're uncapable, I make 'em and take a fall
I take 'em all, leave 'em laying naked soft
Run up in the wedding halls, shoot the cake and all
Make your call, it's all street justice, dog
Even if the innocent, have to be involved
We can take it from the streets, to where you lay in the mall
I'm layin' the law, while your whore playing the four
Nine three eleven, selling those dimes for seven
I don't, aim to please, I aim to squeeze
And I'm aiming for the stars, cock sucker, say cheese, chump




Park Hill Productions... that's my word
Diggiler... yo


It's more lonely at the bottom, than it is on top
More niggas grinding it out, making it hot
It's me, I straight hustle and be cabbin' a lot
Cappadon', same brothers get stabbed and shot
I'm in the hood with ya'll, for real, ready to rock
And I hold the big shit like Big and Pac
Come on, test my spot, come on, test my spot
Come on, test my spot, come on, test my spot


Aiyo, I spun through the ghetto, took a flick of the struggle
The big boy pushing the hard youngings, getting in trouble
Told the Don that I needed a hustle, and so he told the kid
You rock tanktops and need no muscle
But I live for the block, my wife and babies
And baby moms out of town, is like 'fuck you, pay me'
Killah Hill 10304, that's what made me
I'm in the hood, so good with it, fuck 'em who hate me


Oh, I'm holding (more love and knowledge)
Yes, I'm holding (want a sound kids in college)
Oh, I'm holding (more ice and paper)
Yes, I'm holding (we gotta see where life gon' take us)
Oh, I'm holding (more love and tricks)
Yes, I'm holding (we gotta hold our head in the bricks)
Oh, I'm holding (we gotta hold our head in the bricks)
Yes, I'm holding (we gotta hold our head in the bricks)


Aiyo, we travel through the world in expensive life
Made it through the difficulty and we came out right
We be in the clubs all night, smoking and drinking
Wake up early in the morning, start working the ink pen
While the beats in our circonference, manipulating the mind
We on the blocks hustling, participating the grind
Or associating with snitches, protect our riches
Superstars in the hood, what, slums and ditches
That's straight New York shit, feds take our pictures
We live in vanglorious times and beautiful days
Of amped, from the former life, now we kings
Yo, the struggle is for real, sometime we had to rob and steal
Just the ghetto way of life, hustling, keeping it real
Respect this, if you know how it feel, uno
Longevity, we on the come up, Park Hill Productions




Uh, with Park Hill 10304
Park Hill Productions, what up B-Rock?
My brother Bizzy, what's really doo-doo, man? (suuuuu)
Young spark that booga foot
(Let's get it, 06, The Cappatilize Project)




Windshield, rappers are like gnats
They're gettin' splattered 'pon the windshield
Fallin' down like London Bridge, my blade split your onion head
Axe that like Paul Bunyan, Meth prefers the gun instead
Bong bong, put a hole inside your head


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw


How come the streets don't want me to live?
Plus my niggas keep tellin' me fibs
But the devil done poisoned my wiz
I'm doin' this for my family and kids
I'm tryna be wealthy, take my time right and stay healthy
Said it before but I don't think nobody felt me
Yo tried to understand this hand that this life dealt me
I'm on the verge of a whole new makeover
My fake friends, they can take it like a takeover
I'm ready to eat, I'm ready to grip it
Got enemies everywhere, I got chicks that's wicked
Sick shit, niggas doin' wicked ass wig shit
Bid shit, tellin' jakes that I had the biscuit
Niggas be wantin' my leftovers
I'm like a general that died and lost some of his best soldiers
I burn holsters and I kill that dirt religion
Murk that pigeon and I shoot the television


Got that trey pound on you, run down on you
Hard boiled nigga, Clan top soil
My fam straight royal, I'mma die loyal
When them shooters come for you, better throw your flag 'em
I'm pure gun oil, let 'em see that hand cannon
Foundation strong, never ride a bandwagon
Andrew Jacksons, hand-to-hand transaction
Cops jumped out, caught him with his pants saggin'
Criminal individuals up in here
Wild like the theme park ride called The Buccaneer
Weed in the Tupperware, throw you off the upper tiers
Suweeee, I got all my niggas up in here


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw


Imagine the sound of your face scrapin' up against the gate
Of a barbed wire fence, this is barbed iron fist
Heartthrob, iron dick, hoes slob the nob quick
This is odd, so throw it in your iPod quick


Lifeless activity, constant movement
Buyin' elasticity, such improvement
Sword held to where it collapses inward
Spillin' rhymes if it's Shaolin vineyards
RZA had a mixture, then he added sound to the picture
Co-author rewrote the scripture
Math worked from birth, doubled the net worth
Amplified in the time machine of early Earth
A two-way radio, simple yet complex
Receivers, transmitters, interest to contacts
The emergence of the earliest atoms
Transform to a level extremely hard to fathom
Same soup, different bowl, Wu ceramics
Same group on them large-scale dynamics
A wave triggered the burst, glass was shattered
Galactic matter served on a graphic platter


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw


Overachiever, power hungry overeater
I95, whip fly like an overseer
I'm overconfident but some might say I'm overeager
Or overzealous, especially when it's over cheeba
I got a soldier's features, I rock the coldest sneakers
My sneakers' so cold, can't wear 'em 'less you hold the heater
Can't push me over either, that go for dojas
I ain't got no love for posers neither, keep my composure
I'm focused, tryna roll the reefer, let's turn it up
Forget the cope, I'm tryna blow the speaker, that's all he wrote
One verse could turn your soul to ether
It's time you gave me my respects just like the old Aretha
Mr. Meeeth


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw






The white Russian, ain't a bitch drink
Tight percussion, plus I make these kids think
Distinct, the style is flawless
Heat, street, whatever you wanna call it
I spend most of my time in sorrow
So me and Fresh put out tracks like there's no tomorrow
'Cuz if there isn't, there isn't, through my songs I'm living
Etched in time stay alive through my vision
Can the style advance past the man?
Can the man advance past the style with a plan?
God damnit, throw cards like Gambit
Never settle for standard, not a punk like Rancid
I don't dream about diamonds on my neck
It's more important to me to have your respect
I need your word that you'll carry on my text
And then be like, "Aight Ives, whats next?"


Another day another dollar
This is it
If you fighting for your honor
Stick with it
Ivan Ives and Cappadonna
Rip that shit
If we didn't you'd be livid


Pants hangin, eyes red as apples
I'm on the block with a Snapple
Hustle all night, eat white castle
My album is past due, life got me stressed
I love my seeds to death, emcee til my last breath
Surviving the struggle never going under
I know hunger, that's how I sound when I spit
Lost everything, been through all types of shit
My riffs touch it, I ain't never gonna quit
I'm in this for life, rap off any beat
Ask anybody, Don is still street
Fancy garments, hot beats
And y'all go hard for God, even when I don't speak
Nigga I'm still plottin, somethin to get gotten
So much pain that my heart feels rotten
Between court cases, and niggas cock blockin
Guns poppin in the hood where I live, something gotta give


Another day another dollar
This is it
If you fighting for your honor
Stick with it
Ivan Ives and Cappadonna
Rip that shit
If we didn't you'd be livid


Mind skilled, I rock the beat tight
Rhymes so ill, make you want to re-write
See life, back and be life
Rap's Holy Trinity, give me three mics
(Beautiful Bastard)

I exist in the pixels
Iron fist comes down on the pitbull
Dog, your thinking's too wishful
That's how y'all get caught up in crystal

I'm on fire like Richard Pryor
Other emcees old milk, about to expire
Killing the suburbs like Michael Myers
Do so many shows I recycle flyers

Aww, look at what y'all kids thought up
A generic underground rap product
If you sevened out, that's just hard luck
Take a note from Ives and Cappadonna


Another day another dollar
This is it
If you fighting for your honor
Stick with it
Ivan Ives and Cappadonna
Rip that shit
If we didn't you'd be livid

Another day another dollar
This is it
If you fighting for your honor
Stick with it
Ivan Ives and Cappadonna
Rip that shit
If we didn't you'd be livid




I, am, hustle & flow
I do whatever I do to get that dough
Used to sell tour raps at the 1-6-Oh
Got caught wit the raps up under my coat
Feds locked me up, on the Staten Island Ferry Boat
Alot of niggas used to stuff they raps wit soap
Yo, I hustle all the time like I'm pushing the dope
Got rap like an E pill, rap ecstasy
Yo, the rap shit, kinda like sex to me
When I bust one nut on the M-I-C
Hustle for the neck nut, never hustle for free
Yo, I flow wit the hustle when I spit my G
Aiyo, I, am, hustle & flow
I'm a hustler, hustle mad rap wit GZA
We shoot you wit that shit, that make you shiver
Fiends line up, flows that attack the liver
Suffocating in your vein like dirt in the river
Nigga taught Cap rap, that broke the cow's back
You high all night like where those dudes at?
Narco's on our tail, running fast in the building trynna block our sale
We got raps coming out our ass
Hustle and flow, nigga, rap in a stash
Bring those bottles back, get that cash
Rap re-up, two get a nigga three up
Hustle all night, baseheads still be up
Staten Africa, niggas catch malaria
Raps stuffed in my sock, watch out nigga
Yeah, he's the carrier
I, am, hustle & flow
I do whatever I do to get that dough
I, am, hustle & flow
I do whatever I do to get that dough
Sell rap under the trees, in the Congo
Some Puerto Rican stashed rap in the bongo
Don Kaneesh, sell raps, take the risk
I got lawyer, track down all my shit
So just in case you wanna cop more heavy
None of ya'll rappers don't have to worry
Cuz I'm good wit the hustle and my flows is crack
Yeah, I'm talking bout rap, jeans, hoodies & Nikes
I see the pigs coming when they flash the lights
Now get dough, I am hustle & flow
I, am, hustle & flow
Aiyo, hustle everywhere, hustle rap like ki's
Anywhere I hustle my rap, I watch for D's
Dickhead niggas try to bite my steeze
Stop trying to sell your raps around my blocks
Yo, your shit sound garbage and you making it hot
You ain't hip hop, nigga, ya'll rap is pop
Yo, my flow so good, I might get me a spot
Niggas don't want me to come up, the hustle is lethal
I sell it to the kids, I love the people
My shit sound crack like cooked up blow
I told ya'll, I am hustle & flow
I, am, hustle & flow
I, am, hustle & flow
Hustle my raps, kid, everywhere I go

Do whatever I do, to get that dough, holla





'donna and Tekitha (ohhhh... ohhhhh)
Big boys hold they weight and one shotty
(Noo... noo...) Killa-professionals, word
Pirates (Ohhh...) Murder on TV or on the CD
Bless me, Killa Bees, RZA paint
Yo, I could see, I could see


I can see clear like a vision
No mystery to realize
The decision, no, no, no, no
Is no longer in me...


Yo, I could see, yo, I could see like owls in the night
Thieves' blindness no longer exist, uplift
Behold the life of a chemist, used to be a menace
But Don-Don never could form, my mind's like Anaconda
Never sore, forever see thru over the trees
Eyes like a bird, Jay Bird, best seen and best heard
W.T.C. never sold out for no body (no longer in me....)


Tryin to rush them, swing around me
Good an author, lies you told me
Now I can, now I can see...
(W.T.C., the best in the facility)
Never raise at harmony
Now I know I must simply release
That I did amd what's right
Changed my mind...
And recoginzed that only I can see me...
And you can't, can't deny it
That the things you've done effected me...
Ohh... I can see




Knowledge come first, regardless of the hardest
Some get trapped, some couldn't adapt
When the Wu-Tang Pillage came back, it's like life
Shed life, from a dart came a whole world
Clear like a vision, I'm inside of a pearl
With my whole heritage, we tight like panthers
Take chances and be the all eye seein
Donna and Tekitha, anti-easter
We 3 peice suit and tie, asiatic
See thru the bullshit, come with the static


I can see... clearly... yea...
My eyes have been opened to you now
Hey.. hey (I could see you clear like a vision)
Hey.. hey... still see clearly
I can see your ways and actions
You've shown me, I can see, I see
Your ways and actions, you've shown me
Ohh... I can see

Got them fat legs, killin' them Gucci's
Heels on, with the fat coochie
The way it's feelin' you seducin' me
Take time, create, yeah my legend is straight now
Ya inner vibe's the side of the juicy
Cheeba queen, treats on, jeans, state to state
And she got the nerve to fuck me all mean
While I rock all green, by all means
We in the mall fiendin', one more hump then I'mma scream
Boo throw me more of you, I'll take all four of you
We could flip it on the floor while I'm pourin' on you
Make me kiss it in the store on you
Cop the new drawers, the dick is all yours it's a mornin' blue
Straight mines, thats a warnin' duke
Watch me climb, that pussy looks shaped and designed
Yeah, line for line, rhyme for rhyme
That coochie is mine, I might just need it this time




Shut the fuck up and get in the car
Girl, your high beams is on, I wonder how they fit in that bra
We in the front seat, splittin' cigars
I'm on my job so you handcuffin' ho ass niggas, be on your guard
Especially on ladies night, I like it when they take a swallow
Straight out the bottle, but that ain't lady-like
I call 'em lil' pet names like Ma and Boo-Boo
So everytime I see your girlfriend, never confuse you
With the next down-ass chick, that play a part
That's cool enough to pardon my French menage a trois
Meth Man, real talk, don't mean to put you on the spot
But I know a spot to kick your heels off

But still a villain, I serve 'em Dick Dastardly
Here's a little taste of Ice Cream II (Ice Cream II)
So put some Vicky Secret on, trick, I might swing through




Yo, I love my dick-size, like I love women and shit
My head grew over these years, now I got a nice dick
Beauty mark right on my balls, girl, have a nice lick
Cute in the face, hair-do, you got some nice lips
Pussy monkeys holdin' my cock, just like it's vice grips
Part down the crack of your ass, your frame is priceless
Butter-butter caramel swirl, chocolate chip
French vanilla sundae girls, banana split
Cum drip down in your chin, right on your soft tits
Put your hand gently in mine, give me a soft kiss
What's really good? Girl, slip me your number
You blowin' up, and your lookin' Ice Cream this summer
Better than Beyonce, Halle Berry and them
Honey, you lookin' scrumptous, I ain't worried 'bout them
You my straight hood chick, girl, you more than a gym
You got that fat tight pussy like Notorious KIM
Butter-butter caramel swirl, chocolate chip
French vanilla sundae girls, banana split, uh..






Tommy Hill rocking ice niggas
Tommy Hill ice rocking niggas who fuck...
Mira, afrente
Take a one on one to this shit y'all
Get your nostrils clear
Come on, sniff your brains out
All my Al Capone, Al Pacino niggas
Who's down with drug smuggling
Cappadonna, Golden Arms


Check out the rap kingpin, the black Jesus
I know a few niggas sniff coke and caught seizures
Peace to half-moon Caesars, and all the bitches in the bleachers
Hot weather, sex on the beaches
Jewelry shopping out of the country, deluxe luxury
People saying that my chains look truck on me
But what about the Wonder Woman bracelet
Two-oh point three diamond cut engraved rubies kid, I laced it
My sweet tooth gotta nigga throbbing, ready for robbing
But first hit Maria's for a butter almond
The bionic microphone is Smack Mechanic
Move like a bunch of Mexicans with bandanas
Son it's on, so we can just max a million
I got the spot sewn so we can make a billion
The God's tropical, ladies call me black fruit punch
Rainbow flavor niggas murder niggas for lunch
Peace to the Paris Crew in the avenue, and my nigga Jay Love
Who carry switchblades on the reg, duke


Yo, the first branch, the third leaf, whoever want it got beef
I politic, show love, crush those who dare creep
Into my realm of sunshine I praise divine
Fine line between Donna dumb, deaf and blind
He ain't mine, he shook like the faggots in daytime
Crossed over grain while we was bubbling moonshine
Sipping on a Moet, laid up, Rae-Gambino
Mastermind the plan, Tony Starks, Cappachino
Developed while your head be swelling up off of the Nation
Blinded by the ice while I release the confrontation
Donna holy fat bags of weed, ravioli
Pasta, bodyguard the killa bee songs like Kevin Costner
Infra-red all inside your bumbo, rasta
Cappadonna pimp the derby like the mobster


Yeah, yeah
Eight spaghetti lame brain ass niggas
Quarters, nickels, and dimes bitch
Except for overtime nigga
Any ass money suit me fine
Cause I'm coming strong, breaking niggas backs
Keeping shit real
If you haven't noticed bitchy ass rusty, ass nigga
Let me tell you this one time
Tony Starks, Raekwon the chef
Cappachino and Golden Arms
Is coming through mad strong
From the isles of Shaolin
For all them faggot ass
Rusty chickenhead bitches too
Shup Shup baby?


Yo back in the days, bagging cracks, scraping plates, flipping cakes
Who them heavy head niggas hating Jakes
It be us, wall to wall soldiers, hanging in halls getting over
City niggas shoot for blood money rocking Rovers
Stay dipped, don't have no money in your pocket in the streets
Why these people mob money in they Jeep
Crack bums watch your back for jums
Cost me for a fake twenty dollar bill
Get 'em son, we ain't the one
Politicking, plus vicking, sick of these Dominicans
Eating good, had to shoot my way up out of Bennigans
That's life, to top it all off, beef with White
Pulling bleach out trying to throw it in my eyesight
Yo what the fuck is on your mind?




Uh, yeah..
Yo


I don't even know you!


Peep the scene, remember Cappadon' from Ice Cream
I got my nice clean, my ice beam, my nice jeans
Pillage For Life Team, we fight schemes, we bite Beans
We mic fiends, we the light means
We be ignitin' the scenes, we be enlightin' the teens
Spicin' up my mental cuisines, my blunt steams
My stunts screams, I hunt the princess and I hunt Queens
Get a Dutch and I dump my greens
No seeds in my weed, it's like tangarines
But I'm spaced out, muthafuckas, and I'm dope fiends




Yo, I'm back on the set, like me and the kid LuLu
Fuckin' with the ill hoes that eat doo-doo
Dressed up Manhattan style, walkin' the poodle
They put period blood inside noodle
On a curious tip, they drop voodoo
That's why when we see a bitch, man, we like "Yo, bitch, who you?"
You know my style, my whole crew keep a nice shoe
Original Don', slut, do you




Yo, I'm a hot piece, my top piece, they top crease
I knock beef, I drop teeth, I lock heat
I boxbeats, I rock cleats, I stop sheets
I pop a ecst', and I pop treats, my clock beeps
With the pussy, my cock meets, my block creeps
Shockin' ya peeps, my police gut is wop ya niece
We big niggas and we like broccoli's
Never let the Ox' leak, we top cheeks





(feat. U-God)

Yeah ninety six Park Hill style
Burial ground sound in it forever Dunn
Politic

Verse One: Cappadonna/Cappachino
Here we come right through your eardrum Dunn
Cherry head catch feel the draft of the aks
You catch one trying to pretend you could win
Headlock show the block kid counterattack
Don of mine stay connect 4th Disciple trife
Ain't nuthin ice cream, kid you get blown like steam
Park Hill Projects, the black Idi Amin
Ninety-six era, not the crossover lever
Chain swinger talk swing, probably wardrobe king
So what now? Industry kids'll lock it down
Only two loyal, dustin that find you there for
You wanted to enter thirty-six in the soil
My technique is speak have you knocked out weak
Forever in it, my slang dick goes so deep
Thirsty for hip-hop, Staten Isle niggas can't stop
Runnin wild like a child till we reach the top
Stapleton, New Bright, and West Brighton the harbor
Connect, me for vet, Don King and a tech
Thug cats'll get done up on black man's sun up
Cap the imperial, bring out new material
You hold me down, analyze all cherry-head
Wu is in town, catch the hand-off
Prepare for my dancehall standoff
Mercy when I come blow your mic-hand off, sorry I touched him
Here they come again through customs
Mad ways to dead the wax one way to bust him

Chorus:
If it's alright with you it's alright with me
We can take this rap game to a higher degree
We can do this Spike Lee or how you want it to be
Check it, Golden Arms plus new Cappadon

Verse Two: U-God, AKA Golden Arms
These ninety-nine powerful circling swords
Impact from all the heat dug deep and locked on
Chip off the bone, hard face and hard fists
Chop off your option, have you felt a neck twist
Cassette disc and wrist, meltdown your pistol mist
Burnt to a crisp, bombarded my pistol grip
Tongue gripped the nigga, raw tone the jawbone
Leaning Tower Pisa sounds of the Mars zone
Chef dropped that bomb, the takeout will still linger
Twenty crazy christians, to lock in hole and heat up
Who the finger rap singer with hip layers of phlegm
Caused by blunt smoke, heart disease plays the friend
I ran out emotion, my rap style's devotion
I got hosts for you Soviet peoples across the ocean
My path releases, volcanic acids
Engage in the page activity is autographics
Fraction of my busting microphones start to lust and
Words plays over power practice might bust em
The black male persuasion known to hunt you for sane
The Big Apple verbal concert, for the occasion
The vital snap, now insert my Spinal Tap
I got forty more swipes to pipe, thirty slapped
The power from the cram broke the bottom of the pan
With Earth Wind and Fire, ice water dead grams
American hustler up and coming with a vengeance
Makes no magnet charge, plug vivid my extension
One lesson motivation for my pistol profestation
Slang person nailed now we move on a motation
Location, point-blank, on point be the vessel
Politic the defecit measure, point the decibel
We're credible, renaissance, eatin off the barrel
Advanced chemo, Die Hard to my demo
Chorus




Never seen nothing like that...
She got a body like.... whatever
Might have to just, try to like slip her my number
In her pocket, like, bump into her
Like I'm trying to pick-pocket her
Diggiler, huh


Beautiful black woman, red, yellow and white women
I got the right woman, some niggas fight women
I build foundations up, and I invite women
I entice women, I love nice women
That's gentle and kind, yo, I stimulate her mind
And she stimulate mine, until she real freaky
Women that love sex get real sneaky
She had me crying when she crushed me, I should of known
When she was with that nigga Jay, and she was fucking with me
Never sold pussy to me, I was fucking her free
Taking her garbage out for her, and sucking her feet
Slobbing her down, hold her by her waistline while I'm crushing her cheeks
When I'm done, I wipe her down and massage her physique
My ghetto princess, ain't nothing sweet
She straight lied in my face, yo, this one is for keeps
Called police on me, plus she be fucking my peeps
What kinda nigga want a bitch that cheat?


If you don't stop, with the games you play
Girl, somebody's going to get played
And it might be you... and it might be you...


One day, lady love caught me, tried to extort me
For my heart and every peace of property
Yeah, she necessary, but secondary to my garden nature
She keeps her pussy like a soultaker
Sexy fly black diva, with connect like genova
Connections, my murial extensions, lights on in the Ac'
Hoop' dog, not tinted, but I'm all up in it
Sweating hard like a race for the senate
She said she love my long verse with the hook in it
To hit, marvelous, and she got hard when I spit
Realest shit, not a trick
Or your, average chick, she on her time
Nine to five school, slow grind, no money
And she never mind, she put in work for the kid
That understand how I live, never sweating for time
Plus she got her own crib, you little devious thing
That came from my rib, you even got a man at home
Laying up, in your bid, paying your bills
Cuz you all up in this here, like some whisper it's Shaton
You all up in this here, and I dare you
To spit and tell the day that I raised the dead
I bring the truth to life, girl, you like a best friend
But you somebody wife, we gotta stop
So this the last time tonight, so meet me at our spot
So we can get it on, cuz a mountain to mourn
When I hit to dawn, your boy Born

I'm the great mind bender
I can never surrender
Or sell out or sell my soul
For any league of sinner
I'm good when I exit, better when I enter
I go to war in the summer
Even the winter
I'm known everywhere, yo I'm not a pretender
You can't defeat me
I don't give about a fuck about Judge 
This is a medium mic
Fill it with adrenalin
You scared and tremblin'
I kill snakes like a gentleman
I chop they head off and I drop they head off
I pop they head off
Yo I never stop lettin' off
Can't stop lettin' my thoughts off
Attack ya'll niggas barjack ya'll niggas for bars
Yo the world is ours
Young black ghetto stars
Green wheat in the jaws
Yo we speedin' the cars
Yeah we beatin' the broads
Yeah we beatin' the odds
Fuck around
Mic nigga weave the Mars





Yo I move like stray forces
Bullet proof courses
Immaculate bosses
Disciples a pair of horses
Nemesis squeezin' a mac from a black Pegasus
The game follow my rap lines
Just like a Methodist
Rosee and holy grails
Guns are blowin' still
Lines I spread em through your mind like a virus
Through your mind I'm ill
Contagion, biochemical spills
Most real I burn in church
Slay the Pope so he won't tell
My projects is jail cells parallel to hell
Crucifixion iron nails in the bellies of whales
Deceit demons on the faces of all of they bills
The tongue of man kills and nations get divided
Over a   while your flesh rottin'
My ambience like Ponce de Leon's
With a high conscience
Holding lamas under both armpits
Screaming at your  shotgun with holy profits
I invade upon, yeah I been a don
Never sell out like Robert Johnson and Viacom
Lines of firearms help out millions of doms
Destroy and conquer
Wash niggas up, Ghengis Khan!




Yeah Rasta League rollin'
New York money let's get it goin'
Middle of the summer snowin'
Flyin' in a 747 Boein'
When the good gets goin'
The theory disown the Roman
Fly Google
Why buy 
Fried rice and spicy seafood noodles
Is nothing that I'm new to
My good niggas is with me
Blazin' 50s
Yes sir, the best word to describe it is
"Amazing" simply
This is bow tie gentleman thug shit
For real I'm like a D boy that's watching
These drugs flip
Shadow fade warrior
Pour me a shot
I'm rockin' out at you
Because I'm about to copy a yacht
Go to ww.boatsbrand.com
And purchase from the site witcha car
I'm a state cal regardless of this paper or Paypal
The son of man medallion
This is a grenade, BLAW!





Bows crunch
The reload punch
You blow lunch forever walk with a stone 
Quasimodo, the rest of them blow chunks
My logic's simple
Crack mortar out your project window
Sip plenty with a 360 kicks spindle
Smile at your bitch swindle
The bloody smock grin block block thin
Like fingers in the cotton gin
My godless spin
Goose steel cup could rot and sin
Walk with a sugar cane my plots stay boxed in
Metal name pedal slay tracks within
On train tracks the same blade
That slice the keys back
Graffiti halo horsepower unstable
Rose pedal poisonous tracks from Aesop's fable
Run with a lionheart   stable
 wheat jabs art of warrin with this table





Firearms and murders this business absurd
It's the federal service doesn't want me to write these verses
Mighty  grapple my favorite pen
Fitted choice for a 
Lighting up the end trying to warn his friends
Memory's so short can't even remember how to talk
Well enough to warn you not to seek what I sought
Populations reduced down to 15 per cent
They think that's the only way to increase common sense
People provoke how to resent
Riot, rage, revenge, the primal recompense of a man
Disrespected in front of his men
Why would you ever pretend a human life
Is worth the money you spent
No material could make a man so spiritual intent
I feel that's why Almighty was sent
Backslide, try to repent
But be careful following a life that's so bright
You walk into a pit




Down in the dungeon I be drinking and smoking
Niggas wanna judge me and fuck with my emotions
I'm too pressed to be stresses never the less
Some got the best of me, I failed a few tests
I'd rather build with you than hate you with this tec
A big OG, peace to my nigga Deck
Peace to whoever showed me love and respect
In the dungeon, yah you better protect your neck
If you know about piff the (?)
The dungeon is not (?)
Mad chicks in the dungeon, never upset
Share 'em with the whole crew right after the (?)
Lot of niggas in the dungeon with unpaid debts
Try not to live life with a bunch of regrets
In the dungeon yah you got to learn the steps
In the dungeon shh quiet as (?)

Ball and chain
(?) straight for one's mentality
One man's mentality wasn't getting a salary
He was lost in a world so big
No wife, no kids, no car, no business
Useless
No DJ, clueless
Where'd they do this
Yo that's foolish
To even fake or live life like that
You got to grab it by the nut sack
Yo in fact
You gotta take charge, make change
Switch your lane
Its not the same
Never you mind the drug game
You'll get more from the blood bank
You better think
Or just go hit a bank then
Reality sets in he's starting to think
How much time would he take in the bank
When reality sets in he's starting to think
How much time's he gonna spend in the clank?

We need a man to open our eyes
We need a man to make us hear again
We need a man to make us live again
And I'm telling you that black man is in America today




Ironfist killas..


We Othorized, The Pillage
Ironfist killas, The Pillage


We came soul conquer, Ironfist marching archer
Spark bullseye, clips for the starters
My heart robbers, cromadone flips from sex to village kids
We family drop kicks, caught in the death wish
My state as I regulate, ice cold like Bering Strait
Prepare what the genie gave, bloodbath Frank
Clean-up hitter, samurai swing, the head splitter
Talk litter, now your shiver in the Shao', kill a nigga!
Kick ass, fight tits, leave your money on these grits
Thin line between love and hate, ain't budging and ain't try calling you a snitch
But dug a ditch, what it ain't, RBs and black rose in advance
We always take the ransom, big source of racketeer
E.D.I. sing fear, got all that I ask
Came busting, I am in the struggle, Othorized F.A.M
We had to bubble, stole face hard rocks, crush it down into rubble


We Othorized, The Pillage
Ironfist killas, The Pillage
We OTF, The Pillage
Ironfist killas, The Pillage


Shall be crooked from the bricks, banned from the streets
Monkey flip niggas, tear ass with they cleats
Reach for the Ironfist Pillage, righteous fist killings
Villains, we thugs for the thrillings
(Bad habit, spilling into your lives
We taken your wives, big swords or butterfly knives
Go head and chop them, care about nothing
Straight off and rocked em, stalked through the dark and got to drop them
Jumped off, make me dumped off and checked out
Leaped from your torso, spit blood from your mouth)
We the block rockers, tearing it up from out the bang
(Inside murder) Iron Fist swang
(Kingpin call shots, we take over blocks)
And burned through the streets, and crashed like big stocks
(Give them everything, revolt like Kroatian
Zoom for the land (cuz it's ours for the taking)
Higher education, full violation
Third world niggas cause havoc through migration
(Head to head confrontation) so never think twice
(Crossing through our path, you might lose your life)


We Othorized, The Pillage
Ironfist killas, The Pillage
We OTF, The Pillage
Ironfist killas, The Pillage


Now it's the good side turning back
I play the hood like Bank and Thad
I run up in the gate and spanked the lab
Twist something, flip something, this fish shank your dad
The Mac-double-one in the stash, ready for blast
Talk is cheap, now that's why I keep it low with the heat
White boys, black boys running the street
Double guns (guns), I roll with nothing but the troubled ones
Ain't nothing sweet when you fucking with us
I play the elevator shaft with my finger ready to bust
First floor, territory turned raw
My Iron Fist out to hurt y'all, I got a crew called The Pillage
Watch how I fill it up in your skillet
It's Lounge Lo, Othorized F.A.M., we still building




The Pillage, The Pillage!
(Pillage! Pillage!)




"What you doin' on our turf punk?

Give it...

Give it!

Motherf-cker, I said give me the message!

Nigga, you been busted?

Well I ain't got no f-ckin time to play with you. Now give me the message...

No, that's out man. You know, what could we The Lords do with a punk like you?

Burn him!



Yo, Gambino niggas who swipe theirs
Deluxe rap cavaliers
Midgets who steal beers, give 'em theirs
Sit back jollyin'
My team be gaming like Three-card Molly and
Drug Somalians pollying
Mittens raps they crocheting
A-yo Iron, these niggas portraying
But haven't been paying
For real, slide on these niggas like a fresh pair
Caesar fade style, usually tuck grenade
Throw a blade, fuck getting laid
Guzzle this shit like Gatorade
Day to day Wallies half leather, half-suede
Connecting with the high stylist, dun
Light up a chalice
I run with nothing but the wildest, foulest
Come on now, long-dick style
Niggas on the hit out, ay yo Iron bite my shit out
Eventually, bust a rap gun mentally
Been doing this a century kid, just meant to be
Get on your knees and bless me with a gem in the Caribbean
Skiin' off white (?)
Snatch Canadian cream with Scandinavians
Palladium style, play it like thirty-two Arabians
The greatest lesson is don't owe, you might get stole on
When I go bury me with velour on

[They come to me, and understand, just let me get mines first. Then after I
Get mines, y'all can do what y'all wanna do. Fuck 'em up bad]


'Sho 'nuff, hit the Bank and thrust
Wu Nauticas Jamie Sommer got trained on the tour bus
We upgrade, swallow raw eggs, read the label
Hitting white-label, left the Winnebago unstable
Smooth sailing, walked in, my Earth start kneeling
Started stealing, I'm too ill, see we're grilling at the parlay
Kicked up, mack, max motion
Michael Bolton magazine quote, I'm too potent
Louisville mix pain kill rap
Fuck benadryl the violin in 'Knowledge God' sounded ill
Tremendously obnoxious, no blotches
My telephone watch'll leave bartenders topless
Dead arm the prosecutor, smack the juror
Me and my girl'll run like Luke and Laura
We sit back on Malayan islands
Sipping mixed drinks out of broke coconut bowls, we wilding


Sit back jollyin' (ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha)
Sit back jollyin' (ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha)
Sit back jollyin'
My team be gamin' like three card Rolly an'
Drug Somalians pollyin'
Sit back jollyin'
My team be gamin' like three card Rolly an'
Drug Somalians pollyin'
Sit back


Deep meditation sound orientated, war the blizzard
Rap paramedical the wizard
Cappadonna, never catering to none
My microphone and three verse weigh a ton of slaughter
You order five thousand back across the water
My laboratory story keep me flowing with the glory
Acapella or deep dirty instrumental
I could blow the sky like the stormy wind blew
One gallon of wilding, Park Hill profiling
I cut your face a Buck 50 sure why you smiling?
For violating my position
I leave you smoked like a crackhead on a mission
Two tokes of mic dope, one stroke of elegance
Rated like the movie graphic told intelligence
Person to person, it'd be hard for you to take a trophy
You better off to get somebody out to try to smoke me
Cause I'm PLO TKO every day
Dancehall General, Party Fanatic Colonel
Cappadonna son'a old school Disco Inferno
Veteran for rapping with the new set of Wu the hard rapping
Ninety-six jive, I keep the live crowd clapping
When I bow, all praises due to Staten Isle
I spark the mic and Shaolin spark the methtical
Every evening, I have a by myself meeting
Thinking who's gonna be the next to catch a beating
From my mental slanging, bitching rap twist the point of warfare
I brutalize, all competition catch hell here
Chance him, that's what they said, threw up a ransom
I jacked it, stripped the beat naked and packed it
Gimme my rewards


[The way I, the way I wanna get 'em. I want 'em gotten. I want 'em layin'
Out. I want 'em gotten. Cause niggas need to be got. He need to be
Taken off of here. That's right.]




Yo yo right here
This one is for the banana gang
Yeah
Word up
Bust them banana clip thangs
Shh
Know what Im saying
Gladiator posse (Get em)
Cmon lets go


I got a fetish for hot chicks
Hot cars, trucks, fly whips
Seventeen I got whipped
Crack, drugs, guns, all kinds of shit
I used to be in the bricks
Like a stray dog, petty crimes
Young homies with no minds carry nines
The pain made me stronger
The blocks getting longer
Police (?) type shit over (?)
New York overboard nigga
See Digga
Postcard, cant afford the sticker
What the fuck nigga
This shit is ridiculous
Get with this
Mosey with the go-getters
Hats, Nikes, and sweaters
The back of the pound pound
Straight crazy head trips
Im a fuck up, child support victim
Off my rocker, I dont know just pop you
Black out like my lost dog
Religious rap doctor, beef stopper, peace popper
Give me love, give me crazy hugs
Yeah Im better when Im down with serious thugs
Certain niggas cant be at the clubs
They be in the valley in the shadow of death
Hope niggas never lose they step
Arm or head either
This one is like ether
Im not yalls teacher
Yall like Halloween, Bush, and Easter
I just sit up in the booth and I bust the beats up
(Get em)


Uh huh
Nows the time
Now-now-nows the time
For us to come amongst this nation
This nation of rap artists
And give homage to the palmers
The Heckle and the Jeckyll
Big Don
(?)
Nigga
(?) part two
This catfish ain't allowed around here
Fucking boys
Yeah




Had enough you... Tango... when I hit three
Pull that God damn trigger... one... two... *gunshot*
And ya'll are proof, meet me back at the place
(What in the hell) It's Jones, break him off!


Theodore, Theodore, Theodore
(Muthafucka, it's the Unit
This the shit, throw your elbows to it)


All ya'll upcoming M.C.'s, follow the Don
We gon' take a little walk around Eminem's pond
To a nice beautiful place, where 50 got rich
Far far away, from the drug dealer shit
Down deep in the bricks, where the thugs kill shit
I'm gonna keep reppin' my hood, and I ain't gonna stop
Fightin' to get paper, while the pistols pop
These police hate me, and wanna close my shop
Yeah, street flavor niggas, me and my Goon Squad
Mixed with Theodore, kid, bang my tunes hard
Bang bang, be Don, be doin' my thang, thang
Especially when I go hard for God
And a special ed' bitch respect my retard




Paid us money? (Yeah, comin' in, all right?)


I'm in the 0-5 Benz, with the suicide doors
Lazy eye lights, and the apple suede floors
Mossberg jacket, Carmine's, number six
My guns out the windows, reload it like The Matrix
I'm tryin' take this back to '86
Where the chains are hollow, and silly rabbits had 'tricks'
We all pose like jail flicks (word)
And them nicks was like twenties
We ain't rock Christ heads, we had Playboy bunnies
And Jordans to, I rocked ones in '85
I'mma rap, but I rhyme, just to stay alive
No jive, we fam, like the Jackson 5
Twisting the Gerder, one leg on the wheel as I ride
No low profile, I need meat on the wheels
And the law gonna help me get a mil for reals
Big business, billion dollar funds for deals
All protein, son, I need steak for meals
Keep your scampi, pa..






Aiyyo
Here's a little story ghetto love situation
'Bout a girl I met who had many temptations
She was so fly, get high, well understood
Big-ass big brains and straight out the hood


Yo
Aiyyo, I woke up early took a stretch and a yawn
Had a 2 o'clock appointment with this girl name Dawn
She ain't the Avon lady but her beauty was strong
Right before she went to rest she had me singin this song
She must be a special lady
And a very exciting girl
I don't know
She had the high-glow's switchin
See her in the club you hear others chicks bitchin
But Dawn quit to bust a bitch ass and shit
See she did 12 months over a ratchet
Not no crab shit
Got bagged with the MAC
Taxi cab shit
Clip was hangin out her panties with no where to stash it
It was classic
Nowadays shes laid back
Helpin me perfect my rap
Only pink and smoked salmon where she feed her cat
White, furry thing
Diamond cut like johnny lex collar attached
Lickin glass bowls in her cat clothes
Cause crazy stacks
Finicky thing
Her kittin drink Polar Spring
Take naps
Near her jewerly box
She play with all the rings
And when she step out the tub its like an ill flick
Carmel skin, bath and body works leave the whole room lit
Cinnamon candles, sweet side, they on relax mode
Paint her toes on the bed slow, watchin me
Versace robe on her body, peak, sippin asti (piemonte)
She a perfect 10 in my wildest dreams DAWN


Aiyyo, she gotta be gone
Waitin on my sweet strawberry pecan rican LaShawn
Holdin my taffy down when I'm gone
Three fourths of her body always covered with clothes
Thats why I'm eatin her candy
And suckin her toes
Sweet sexy LaShawn
She got body like whats goin on
On some marvin gaye shit like lets get it onnnnn
Suuuugarrrr
Letssss getttt it onnnnn
Ayo she a diamond in the rough
Black rose in the hood
I love my queen and she treat me good
Fuck cookin for me
She stash me out when the feds come lookin for me
I'm not cheatin on her or beatin on her
I spend the weekend on her
We on the block when the bills start creepin on her
She right there when it gets sticky
She strict politic to the vicky's
And a fly aviator the color of sky
God on her side
Indian chick with cat eyes
Mad respect with the fat thighs
She busts guns for the revolution
Would straight leave her if she prostituting
Yo my girls the bomb
Intelligent mind
Sky blue louis vetton
Leg muscles, deep dimples
Body is soft she smell fresh like a new born
Pretty feet peitete ass nice shoes on
The sunshine for my quiet storm
Keepin the food warm when I'm gone
It won't be long 'til I'm back to my sweet butter pecan rican LaShawn
Hit me up baby girl, P.S. Cappadon'


Aiyyo, aiyyo I woke up in the morning still drunk off the Henn
Had a 3'oclock appointment with this girl name Jen
You know Jen from a hundred and ten, she push the Lex Coupe
Part time fashion designer she work for Jet Blue
Pretty young thing, with a body like vida
Ass off the meter, Eva Mendes look, strut like a diva
Leave her shine fine, blow minds like dimes of a cheeba
She like it from behind, slow grind, sometimes with her feet up
Ms. Bonita Applebum Bottom, thick as a Roman column
Raw dick it down, love me, even if I'm holdin condoms!
Cause she my bitch, the only cat that I lick
Throwin that ass like Ciara on the top of that whip
Latin decent, velour suit with the cameltoe print
Peppermint flared panties with the garder-belt clips
Tattoo of a small butterfly on her inner thigh
Even at my loneliest times you that Jen will ride...


Whether Jen, Dawn, or Shawn its the same situation
'Bout a girl I met who had many temptations
She was so fly, get high, well understood
Big-ass big brains and straight out the hood




I ain't trying to be no D-boy, I love music, I'm a b-boy
Are you the undercover or the decoy
I'm heavy with the D, Trouble T Roy
A pit with no muzzle about to bust your bubble like a keloid
Too much marijuana got me p-noid
I'm killing instrumentals with that All So Simple Can It Be, boy
Shout to Lil Cease, B.I.G., boy
And Funk Doctor Spock, I mean Redman that's not Leonard Nimoy
88 keys on the keyboard
I'm down to catch wreck, take them first three letters out of record
It's Meth, you heard it through the wire I could be more
Or washed up like Sonny Black's body on the seashore
That's a problem, I could be yours
A monster without the mad scientist and Igor
I've heard it before, a third of these boys
Got murder raps and never even murdered before


Keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
Keeping the streets locked
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
Keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
Run these streets out here don't need cops
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block


Codename Sensei, I live what my pen say
Game hall of fame, flow is MJ, Muy caliente
Je m'appelle Rebel, capisce, comprende?
Son I'm touching 'em up, trust I'm like
Justin Tuck how they ducking the rush
Tryna Break Bad, you catch a bad break
Like I own a bake shop how I stack cakes
Greatness was nothing, Deck the next Nike ad
Wifey bad and my life got 'em slightly mad
Cause I shine like chrome in July
Soldier I opened your eyes, notice the lies
DEA say I'm drugging 'em
I get you leaning hard, I get the fiends to nod, I mean they loving 'em
All hail your highness, terrific win
Put a so-called beast in his place, Pacific Rim


Keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
Keeping the streets locked
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
Keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
Run these streets out here don't need cops
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block


Foul ass police, crooked ass friends
I don't give a fuck yo, the drama never ends
I'm a project nigga, I don't care about the Benz
Plus I had a lot of chicks, you can have those bitches
But I murder your bloodclot if you touch my riches
Yeah crazy ass skipper, I be in the slums, nigga
Fuck where I come from I'm a quiet gangster nigga
First I get you comfortable, then I start shanking niggas
Park Hill code is don't violate the family
Brother to brother it's no snakes in the amnesty
I come through wilding on some Wu-Tang 'Can It Be'
Googly-eyed nigga, chop his face in the ministry
Never scared to do the time, fuck the penitentiary
Leave a bunch of dead niggas, don't forget to mention me
The angel of rap, the un-ordinary light
Already did what I was gonna do before you even got the mic


We left a large solar cloud distinguished by size
Interaction with the wise and civilized
The mind caused matter to fall into a center
A great deal of heat that'll radiate within ya
From out of this collision
The central cord became thick enough to trap its own light and bring vision
Each drop full of Hip Hop energy
Balanced on all sides such great symmetry
The bars unlocked the power of the stars
The mirror in the telescope pinpoint the Gods
From a distance, acting as a guiding coach
Analyze the board, universal approach
Retune the soul to a certain pitch
Changing the frequency frequently, hitting a certain switch
The love is paramount, the connect is brotherly
Respect for the intellect and broad discovery


Keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
Keeping the streets locked
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
Keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
Run these streets out here don't need cops
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block




God rules everything around us
Goons get the money, Killa Killa Hill ya'll


Yo, we grew up in the grind, ya'll
Now it's our time to shine ya'll, yo, we did our time ya'll
Now we back to collect our check, give us our respect
Debts gotta get paid off, a nigga hit the deck
My Goon Squad coming correct, handcuffs, Jakes backin' us up
We got it rough, on some guns bust
Niggas hold dust, through it all, kept our head off
Feds sped up, niggas in my hood read up
We still gully, and my whole click dead up
Clackin' them shots, right, my Goon Squad kick lead up




I'm from the Valley where the Goons stay, valors and S.K.'s
Shoot up your saloon and lay
Through a poverty side of my life, we came from
All the big niggas eat meals, real niggas kept ones
So much drugs in a box, gloves, couple Glocks
Thugs that stay on blocks, wolves that lay on cops
Dressin' like gangstas, I've been silkin' it before courvoisier and blunts with rocks
We had to eat to live, cuz only real niggas protect
Lively hood, and get Hollywood props
I ran with arm specialist who loved to shoot, wrestle, spit
Bang bitches, buy a little drizzle and box
For all that we know, I analyze the rich steelo
Milk the game, Suge Knight a few people
Then made a lot of deposits, throughout the logic
My mental came swift, that's the project




Aiyo, my team pressed up on the crime side
Them devils tried to catch us all, guarding our blind side
I cocked back the hammer, load up on my nine side
Startin' a revolution, like my Goon Squad died, poverty strucken
Right where the poor people reside, deep in the hood
Young bloods stay flippin' them pies, lookin' for easy ways out
My niggas try'nna survive, whippin' the gauge out
Strugglin', against all odds, stompin' the rage out
Duckin' down deep in them cars, whippin' the page out
Niggas stay kickin' them bars, knockin' ya fade out
Get ready for my Goon Squad stars, let the parade out






Uh-huh, yeah bitch!
Same struggles, uh, everyday
Hold this, come here girl
Hmm... give me a kiss, muaww! Heh..


I know these two fly chicks, that used to be legit
They said they don't like niggas no more, and plus they hate dick
With all due respect they wanna love and trick
And I don't know if it's a good thing, or maybe they sick
And I just can't understand, whatever happened to the plan
You used to walk like a woman and dress to the T
Now you try'nna be the man that your father used to be
Actin' like you got a cock and you love pussy
You and my baby mother did it, go 'head push me
And believe me, it's true, I know your whole style boo
You eat rats, bitch, you got worms deep inside you..


Life of a lesbo (uh, uh, uh)
Life of a lesbo (come here, I don't know you was like that)
Life of a lesbo


Even though you independant, and you makin' the big dough
Hate your own father and you used to be ho
Bitch, it's alright to cry, chick, here have a shoulder
'Member you was 13? Now you much older
Used to be a hot chick, now you much colder
You love other bitches, girl, you don't want a soldier
To all the fly honies that's livin' it well
Used to be a lesbo, but think you want dick now
Ya'll best to stop frontin', cuz you really want both
Me and my ex-wife came down Tiffany throat
I fucked both of those bitches, then I went broke




That's what's up... yeah
Yo.. you know me, 1, 2, 3 chicks, it don't matter
I did it all... I love 'em
Life of a lesbo, let's go
Uh-huh, this one right here go out to all
My homegirls up north, Bedford Hills
Albion, knawhatimsayin? Rosinger, haha, hold ya head up
That's my word, yeah, this one go out to Candy Apple
My home girl Sugar Walls, Eye Candy
Cinnamon, Passion Fruit, Melony, Water Melon
Yeah, life of a lesbo... uh... uh..
(We got eyes, but we can't see
We have ears, but we can't hear
We've got a tongue, but we can't speak
We are living men, but we are dead mentally)




Aiyo, when we writing, yo, shit is like the vice laws
Fighting everybody wet, Lex dog, vibe on biting necks
There goes the new hammer, microwave blamp, from the stove to the roads
Down in New Hampshire, brolic size, wallet guys
Frame broiled shotties, with the Ducati's, my pockets is set
Now watch what you rep, I've been buying niggas heads
Wall crawler, Captain Caveman, in the hall scrawling
Money is stacked up, better than yours
Do with the rappers, clap niggas, slap 'em, and car jack 'em
Everything niggas is serving, is crack, what, preferebly Kelloggs
You just a goldmine, yup, cereal bowls of heroin
Yup, the Don Baron, it's worth hundreds, say something
Niggas fronting while we doubling, pump 'em
And lay 'em right in front of the steps
The new Mark Cuban, Mavericks, we moving like Arabics
Faces is wrapped, crosses on like Catholics
Blend to the music, it's all in the game


Riding through life in this fast lane, fast change
Ya'll deal when the lights green, but when that light change
You gotta make a slight change, use your wipers
Cause it might rain, life's a gamble like a dice game


Aiyo, I'm when I'm writing I be thinking like Donald Goines
Posted up on the strip, fishing like bitches hoeing
Blowing like Jesse Owens, run laps around these tracks
And I stay up in the hood like, weed and cracks
Damn right, I still pack the strap, duck if I whip it out
But if I whip it out, you're people will be picking out
A coffin and a tombstone, park 'em in the graveyard
Prayers and a leap of faith, probably couldn't save ya'll
That's the path of bravhearts, clap you in the hallway
Turn two o's that soft, into three the hard way
Move the diesel all day, shut it down in night time
That's when the undercovers buy, in night time
Move to the forefront, Ratch' had the store front
First I had two goals, now I got more front
Bitch I been G'd up, put a O in front of that
Keep them bitches ski'd up, blowing off each other's back


Riding through life in this fast lane, fast change
Ya'll deal when the lights green, but when that light change
You gotta make a slight change, use your wipers
Cause it might rain, life's a gamble like a dice game


Heavy white ice, gold ornaments, hustle and life
Hustle and light, good wit the pill
Be at all the tournaments, stroll in the beach
Out in Luv Allah, we love all of ya'll
Killah Hill, Staten Africa, rap massacre
Make a phone call, have niggas get at cha
Rat ya, two double nines in the back of the Acura, it's a Don thing
Don King, Don bitches under the ring
We don't ever sing, raps get cut in the bing
Posse up, see me the Beemer or Benz truck
Reppin' that W, it's trouble for you
Knife through ya bubble goose, veterans loose, 39 on the deuce
Pick it up, stick it up, niggas is thinking to bust
Breaking these states for they cake, you know what it do
What's up, Goldie? Niggas wanna march, hanging wit Jody
Street Flavor click, roll thicker than shit
We the upmost, faggot niggas get bitched
Smacked wit the toast, crackin' the line in the coke
Niggas'll cutthroat, cutthroat, infered on top of the scope
Crack in the dial, mixed with soap, Killah Island...



  Yo, you know what I mean? Chillin within
 Word up, niggas is stupid
 Look out for the cops man, look out for the cops
 Yo it was on last year Son
 Huh? Fuck

"What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility"
 That's comin from Louis Rich
 Baggin, you know what time it is, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo


Put them cracks down you just started slanging two months ago
What up with Larry Francisco tell him to let that bitch go
Why you standing there? Posing you like Donna Karan wear
Nigga save that, the same shit you had it last year
You be running with them outsiders
That shit is fucked up yo, we never turn to dick riders
Your Mac is big, got a little grip, yo
You think that shit gon live what he did -- what this nigga said
Remember when his mans got there, the whole shit was set up
Shut up, whole fam want the science and the letter
It got back to me some niggas in Medina askin me
"You know some niggas in the gold E-Class," splash to me
Yo that shit you had in Vegas
Yo, it could have got us both sprayed up
They seen the Ac, noticed Jada
Hair salon, treating shorty like Quran
Her fam major swing kingpins you won't dare front on
Octavia with all the ice on, yo
She own a car wash now, her little Keon doing triple life
Marry a Son who got baked, it coulda been
For a half a cake, play the shank, maybe bite her
Shit is fucked up when they got us yo
She fainted at her baby wake now watch the breakdown
"..face responsibility"
She fainted at her baby wake now yo watch the breakdown

"Little ghetto boy, playing in the ghetto street"


Yo all of y'all niggas got the whole story wrong
Talk what you talk but twist the real song
When it comes down to this, not a licensed driver
Show y'all niggas whose style is more liver
This is not a act this is more actual fact
Nothing but experience placed upon track
With the true sound, not lying out the crown
When we not working we hardly be around
Yeah see the light, right now we could fight
You not a real brother you just a fake type
That get on the mic then throw your clich
Half the East coast sounding just like Rae
If you a Gambino, give credit to the flow
If you not a part of this kid act like you know
Fuck the studio, Cappaccino the great
Fly cherry head niggas like planes out of state
I ain't friends with you, only my CD hit you
If you want some then stop fronting is the issue
It's my turn, live niggas could pass
Two-faced rappers push they shit last
Straight off the edge into the rubbish
Peep my new style fuck Cristal and Moet
I drink Evian water while my darts get published

"What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"

"Little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto streets
What you gonna do when you grow up..."

"What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"

"Little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto streets
What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"



One is invulnerable, in fact
It involves strenuous breath control
Out of all techniques, it's the most difficult
The human body has a hundred and eight pressure points
Thirty-six of these can be fatal
The remainder, paralyzing




Yeah
Sure as I live I'm going to get mine
Straight up and down Pillage forever
Ayo, ayo
We sat up in the booth last night
On some ill shit
Put our minds together
Start spitting the real shit
Market these darts get a deal real quick

Living, we forced to win
Blowing on your mindstate yo of course (?)
While Lil Wayne got your brain

All over the world like rain
Reincorporate our life and mix it with street pain

And we don't waste time out here
We know what it is

Yo know the airplane flights
Gym shows in London
I hit the booth
Spit darts to attract this pumping
Spread love to the fans
Get the whole crowd jumping
And me I move well like Barack on something
Lay back on that tour bus
I caught a thought of getting money, burning piff
And yeah busting more nuts
Jokes, I laugh
Some niggas mind they own
Some talk shit, but get choked and stabbed
Listen
I'm the one who be choking the pad
From Staten Island, Park Hill who be scoping your flag
Mama love said do it baby, you go boy
Peace to Sham
You know that nigga he so 'roid
I need money like Jay-Z
A house like Lil Wayne
A Kanye beat, no T-Pain

And we don't waste time out here, we know what it is

Big jewelry and fly wardrobes
Crazy kicks, we like to be at the shows
Getting our fresh on
Breaking ballers, never faking moves
We on some late night shit, honeys is right
Dim lights, the crowds gather, the crews post up
Mad swagger, everybody comfortable
Its crazy how I bump into you
Dimes is cute (?)
Rhyme and puff roots
Get off your stoops, support truth
(?) for roots for rap
Never let the mind go back
Take our time and recline back
Live life, cherish life, cherish the mic, inherit the sight
Mi casa es su casa
Man straight up and down, do what you gots to
Give a little, take a little
Bring it in the middle and get diddled
Its no turning back
Yo this the life we live
We hustle everyday, grind hard, raise the kids
And we don't waste time out here
We know what it is
Live your life
Live your life

Wu-Tang collaboration, Cappadonna, Intrinzik Productions
New York City, Arizona, it's rock, come on, let's go
Jason Porter, yeah, it's a new era, it's rock


It's a lousy world we living in, execution, people dying
In Somalia, starving babies always crying
Governemnt tapping society is always spying
We want our retributions, plus we want our land back
Stopping these killings, giving our oil and our sand back
Still hearing voices cuz ya'll fail to understand rap
I don't give a crap if you don't understand Cap


It's a lousy world, it's


This is my Arizona, India's from out New York
My daddy left me, but these jewels held me down in court
Black and Italian, but we devils for this common cause
That's why we in these streets, wilding and we breaking laws
Both stay, hit he docks, we trading in these shaping shores
This ain't no punk rap, this that get-you-jumped rap
That go against the system, shit that'll get you punked rap
It's such a lousy world, such a lousy world




We got tsunamis, kamikazes, the modern Saddam Hussein
Buildings being targets, even the smartest can't calm us man
It's a lousy place, and the populus out the states
That we don't give a fuck, we're heading towards a lousy fate
Even God turned his back, told Mother Nature to burn this map
And wipe out whole colonies, I don't understand those policies
Race and religion, red tape and the ribbon
Of states and nations, scales of justice, drop the weights with face in




This is my California, movie stars and politics
We still got slavery, I thought that we abolished it
The war on drugs, the world split up
The fam in hunger, man in Pakistan, we blow it up
We got no allies, snatch us, allibies, we weren't there
We telling lies to our own people, man, we just don't care
The human race will lose it's space
A thousand fallices surround this lousy galaxy




Yo, unemployment, see job placement
Gotta spend money up out the basement
Porter and Intrinzik, Cappadonna
Wu-Tang Clan, we ??? em outa the biscuit
Too fucked up to watch the plot thicken
Too strung out, poverty stricken
Government lies with the chosen verbal
Twenty first century Joseph Gerbals
See George The Minister
Administering more lies with a grin that's sinister
Put the back in when your lies and problems call
Rap your style like crime, we'll solve it all
We got a war to fight just like the Holocaust
Find the White House, tall with a ???
Do escape, we crawling on the floor
Secret Service knocking at my door




I don't wanna tell you how to live your life
Your wife a vegtable, just let her die
Everytime I turn on the news at five
The media thinks care about a lie
Helpers think I can make it change
Care about war, but the rest head that way
I don't want the government deciding my fate
Or the public debate how to scandal my remains
We got wars, we got hate
We got Fox News, here's your plate
We take it in, spit it out
Shady green, water it down
I got homeless down my street
They plead and say "Sir, we got nothing to eat"
They ain't the Pope, they the ones in need
Pray every night and again for the meek




Hell on Earth, that's welcome here
Smoke and drink up your Belvedere
Lose your mind, get up your hearse
My fame a gift, but this shit hole's a curse
You wonder why kids grab the cay
They learning quicker in the world today
It's gonna get worse these passing decades
Parents won't tell us, just open the next game
Pitch in for what could be realer
Break bread with us serial killers
Here's another new bright idea
Hyde & Jackyl wild is your baby sitter
Don't think before you speak your words
Then let the tabloids misinterpret them
I am ??? and Cap will show them
Hard to see, but we letting them know

Drinking Evian Don-Don
Stay calm under pressure
Break the sound barrier
Big Wu Tang trucks roll in your area
Wallabees for life
We too hype

Paint murder like Wesley, faggots
Your war stories don't impress me, warrants
So the ratchets broke as well as the next one
Larry Davis reinacting, we puttin' them niggas
Who be talking to killas in comas
Death is so deep, you ever see a nigga eyes rolled back
On the block til I die with that medicine
I will emerge from rap, will emerge from mines
I want niggas to learn, they can't stand me
So I won't feel guilty when I'm receiving my Grammy's
Counting my blessings, hoping my old Earth
Make it all the way to the top, asking Alllah
Give me strength if the nines gots to pop
Them feds put a bullet in the head of my great dane
Poverty child, I feel momma's pain
Walking in my daddy's shoes of shame
Creases in my state greens, criminal lives
Police know as the nine millimeter team
And we don't smoke poofie, find us where niggas be climaxing


We major players, all around the board
And done bent niggas all around the board
Headliners, kill or be killed, so you better move
When it's time to move, or get filled


Pillage for life team, we fight schemes
Nigga fall back, Staten Island
We all black, carry a mack, motherfuckers Osama Island
Been wilding, from Murder Hill all the way to Jungle Nilz
Fuck ya'll niggas, we gotta pay the bills
Nigga move over, two-faced rappers, all you deep throaters
Underground niggas right here, put this in ya range rovers
Staten Island soldiers, New York City post up

I wanna thank you For helping me write this dart
And if it wasn't for you ma' would've never had a start
You taught how to read
Taught me how to take my time and never speed
Taught me how to hold my neck back when my nose bleed
I love you Mamma, espescially for the fact
That you ain't have to take my shit
While I was in the streets, whylin' out, jugglin' bricks
Hustlin', sellin' crack, catchin' 'em vicks
I love you Mamma, cuz in the Bricks
That's just how it gets

(Hook: Cappadonna)
Mamma what you said to me it really touched my heart
I wanna thank you for helping me write my dart

Mamma what you said to me it really touched my heart

(Cappadonna)
Mamma what you said to me, yeah, that's what's up

Keep it low, keep on the go
Just incase keep peepin' the Po
Mamma loco, yeah kid yeah that's my true nigga
I beat ya ass for actin' up know what to do nigga
My moms and your moms might've went to school nigga
When Pops left Moms was the disciplinary
She taught me how to love them women and pop they cherry
Take money, cut time and stab Jerry
Plus I remember what you said to me
Mamma and I don't have to worry
Dear Mamma, after work meet me at the Ferry

(Hook: Cappadonna)
Dear Mamma what you said to me it really touched my heart
I wanna thank you for helping me write my dart
I really miss you And I just wanted you to know that
Mamma what you said to me it really touched my heart

(Cappadonna)
You know I love you Mamma jJust because you my true team
You rose me as a real King somethin' for the Queen
That's why I always stay focused, keep my nose clean
Watch over my family, whoever intervene
Fuck all y'all niggas, tryin' to stop my dream
Block my cream, Mamma I'll pop my steam
Just how you taught me, Mamma bail me out
Jakes still caught me, Thank you Mamma, I'll make a lil' coffee
The things that you said to me, it hit my mind softly
You a strong woman, and Mamma won't abort me
We used to live in Brooklyn, but you SI New York'ed me

(Hook: Cappadonna *Cappadonna ad-libs too*)

Mamma I'm really missing you, I really miss you




(You my Dirty whore, you that Dirty whore)
What else you gonna do to it
But bust it, bust it though baby, bust it
Who else, who else is gonna do it
This is dedicated to all you bitches


Knew this bitch named Trash, she had a hella fine ass
Can't ask, blew my hope in the past
Niggarette gave me gonorrhoea
Pussy dick to the tippy toe like ballerina
Boy you should have seen her
She had a baby face creamer Purinas, called up talking Tina
I put my dick in her womb
She blew my head like a balloon, I had her walking on the Moon


I seen you at the five and dime wasting your time
Oh you shine, I'm looking at your ass from behind
You walked by smelling like watermelon
You might make me a felon, my eyeballs swelling
My nuts start yelling, excuse my prick
Wanna have a talk with you, I'm sick
My medicine is can I walk with you
Fantasy, after that we can cheat
Laid on the bed, handcuffed with hard meat Long stroke smacking, smack it then broke
Nothing can't stop my continuous poke
Compound, porno flick music
Daddy came with it when I wrote it


Dirt Dog be bouncing on bitches like fog
I pollute the air up like smog, bitch
I'm up my jacuzzi, peeping this smoothie
My bitch is a floozy
Dirt Dog ain't choosy, pussy move me
Pretty black dick up in the booty, I like it muddy and swampy
By now you find your ass up shitty creeky
Don't got no fucking room me and my momma in my teepee
Blackberry squeeze, bitch you a tease
Titties small, I got used to the squeeze
Fuck that shit, I'm through with this bitch
Old hen please can't get a bank of these welfare cheese
Now to blow fifty G's overseas
I'm doing the breeze, in my 850


Suicidal, she been in more hotels than bibles
Idol worshipping bitch wasn't the type to make bridle
Strung on how the bitch manoeuvred her tongue
From the top of his dick to the bottom of his ass split
I told the God to jet quick, this wicked bitch was a harlot
But had him trapped up inside the Charlotte Web
She wasn't choosy, fucked for a movie and a loose leaf cigarette
Pussy stay wet and juicy like lemons, big ass in tight denim
Had the most faithful niggas sinning against their women
And enjoyed to watch relationships get destroyed
This unemployed welfare bitch was non-void
And shameless, her attitude was blameless
Even though she had a hundred dicks on her name list
Her obsession caused niggas to get the ass cheek injection
The bitched lied, said she had Urinary Tract Infection
I tried to warn 'em and bomb 'em, but she conned em
Wanted niggas to fuck her raw dog without no condom

*woman moans* oooooh, ahahhh, ohh


You people are all trying to achieve the impossible
That's exactly what we've done
But you'll fail and you'll all die
If we die, the next generation will fight them too
And the one after them for as long as they must
And eventually we shall succeed



Black solidarity day, arrest sentence
Looking at the moon he starts his coming soon
High like my man cmon give me the fame
His flame is so bright, open up your life
Let me swim with your feelings
I love yall to death get married to my song
I prolong, nigga, my style is real strong
Plus I stay dipped like the first day of school
Blood pool kid with the low cut fade
My darts is number one, playtime is over
Black October, my debt still correct
Revised and updated from the old temple
Big Pens is Tai Chi
Head crack shit my brains is Jet Lee
Put away your weapons its Master MC
One hundred skills if you ever try to fuck me


Feet come first, sometimes not the head
Some niggas eat, some dont get fed
If you live by the sword you might die by the lead
You get what you get if you thinking with your dick
MCF mean your thinking with your head
Money comes first this time I can't dead
You get what you get if you thinking with your dick
MCF mean your thinking with your head

Warp in the projects watch out for Ted
Hearse get your first, too late, no paramed
Dark Park Hill day, cold and sour
Its only Staten Island that represent the power
God body we stand, unite, kid, right
With the excellent beam of light, so stand still
Hold your breath, the late homicide hill
Before the big gates, everything was chill
SHAOLIN, its like Hurricane Kim
SUUU, you better beware, we comin in
Original, yeah its the kid from back then
To all the pussy niggas that be tryin to pretend
MCF killa bees, son what, you gotta problem
Deja vu, 45 slug that escalates
Dont perpetrate, hip hop is mine
Find something else, words is dealt, quarterly
In a orderly fashion, thrashin, black mamma javelins
Travellin, once again dun, try to comprehend
Catch a split end



Im takin trips downtown, havin the shit go down
Fresh niggas, fresh hats, sometimes I carry gats
Low straps, baggy slacks, one forced the chain with the six gold caps
I go for dolo, hear my LP style for solo
Han Solo with his rap Star Wars goin on tours for the course
Whirlwind, record spin, walk forward, explorin
The lime livin, plus thank heads forgivin
But sue the ones that dont, Cappa's goin gold
Never sold my soul, twenty somethin years old
Try for the globe, one time tastin the wine
Teeth are dumb, deaf, and blind, have strength
To go the whole length, for my two seeds, house these
Tooth fairies, February sanctuaries, child support court
Days are too short, Im completin all my goals, stay amped up
Be alert, secure the foundation, seek more education
That money can never worth, head first, feet first, whatever the case
MCF means fuck off kid, you outta place






Back with another one, this hip hop shit ain't over
The Wu brought it back I told you
Chef shit is hard
The hip hop critics is dick heads, they'd rather see Shallah in the yard
Writing rhymes that's soft as cotton
We can never ever see that, the nigga flow grows is poppin'
First verse I'll be ready to get clowns
Catch 'em in hallways, the worst look get laid down
And yo, I rhyme for shooters and boosters
Get money churchmen, all those respect my Wu shit
Regardless if you see me on TV
In 3D and HD, I'mma stay safe in Rae beats
This time I'm a bastard swordsman
Who put in that work, real quick then I'm repping to Boston
Don't try to get in my way
Any rapper any herb I'mma blow you like herbs and lick


Fuck a cell phone plan, with a ring I get a hundred dollars
Five dubs in a whip on my way to holler
Yeah I do credits, but not the ones you get in college
My niggas can't afford Benzes, so we rip impalas
Tints on the windows, lookin' like the Ds
Got the dope boys nervous when they see me in the street
Fuck the hollering on wax, you can see me if it's beef
Hollywood will load the gat and put the BBs in his fleece
I'm a preacher with the piece
I used to sell X on the west coast, now I get it cheaper on the east
I've been around the world like Lisa Stansbury
TV with the goosenecks, goosenecks to the cranberry
Got the Clan ready with the 10 Chevy, keep my grams heavy
Slap a bitch ass, doggy style, like my hand's heavy
G up in my swag, tough talk'll get your man buried
Blow the last dragon, part two, nigga, fists of fury


I could care less if you're well know shooters
100 guns, 100 clips, but you still can't move
It's been a while since you heard a nice nigga from BK
Representin' the village, known for lettin' this heat spray
First grip we flipped took like a weekend, 3 days
Whole team runnin' 'round the Ps with AKs
9 different types of drugs, slipping 'em 5 ways
Gettin' rid of a brick in less than five days
I pop your head off, leave your brains on the sidewalk
My 40 cal, a rearrange to your sidetalk?
Where I go, my team, they gonna follow
Top Model hoes, with no game, they gonna swallow
Got a lotta foes, that's why my aim be on hollow
Die before I let you violate, nigga, live by the motto
Pimpin' through lanes, poppin' ?
At this rate, I'm gonna miss it, I might not witness tomorrow


You say you gangsta? Yeah I'm a gangsta
You pop that thang? yeah I pop that thang
Your clip on empty? My clip on empty
Your clique gon bang? Yeah my clique gon bang


Look, I hit a weed spot
Bypass niggas with broke guns and cheap shots
Outlastin' niggas with no punch, y'all eat cock
Get too cocky, the heat cock
You wanna walk a mile in my shoes, you need socks
You need not call out a G, cause he's not
They playin' with a pussy, I'ma show 'em the G spot
This dude's a Meth-head, I'll show him the detox
Look at Johnny with his old ass
I'm still schoolin' the whole class
The kids in the hall, you get no pass
Ice hit the eye like a cold flash
Niggas hopin' I don't spaz
Speak for the have-nots and don't-haves
Fuck it, I'm thorough nigga, fuck their worlds
Meth clutch the mic, bitch niggas clutch their pearls
Tonight, I ain't feelin' no ice stares
If you want it, I'm right here, Staten Island and we don't fight fair


As a young lil' homie, I used to sell crack
I used to run in the front of the building and come out the back
Lil homie on the block with the fly ass gear
Me and my crew used to shop around Union Square
Ay yo, I never knew I would become an MC
Now everybody on the block be amazed at me
Because I rock the mic most definitely
Throw darts and I get fly on you, you know my steez
Buy 25 high?, yo, I stay low key
And if I have to pop something, yo, it's not my fault
I ain't tell y'all niggas try to crack my vault
I'm the new terrorist rapper, the main assault
You ? on your back, elbow a nigga thought
Through Wu-Tang lyrical kung-fu
Death when you enter, all my nigga will hunt you
Peace to the gods
One, two, one, two


Million dollar voice box
It's your choice, Ox
The face Ox cut off
Like tank tops
My motivation is money and mass murdering
While you still provin' you nice in rap tournaments
I be all smooth with the ice and mad burners
And plottin' on takin' your life
Look how I lure them in
Get drunk, smoke ashes up out the urn again
Axe murderin' journalist for the words they writ
Mathematics crafted the beat, called Term to spit
Cause I set fire to shit like a furnace lit
I pack German clips, stash box in the whip
Four door Optimus Prime, Transformer shit
Call the coroner, caskets for half price
Bodies in the trunk, movin' through the Mass Pike
It's all now, cause in Law town
We roll with premature babies
We carry four pounds

Let us milk this cow, the best way we know how
Park Hill projects, chicka-POW
One culture, return of the track slasher
Double doser, Cappadonna broadcaster
Strivin for perfection, the only way I got
My life back was through investin, devotion
Movin my soul toward the skit, vocabulary
Comin out my ass like shit, to feed my babies
I gotta fight y'all MC's, this money
Be gettin me high just like cheese in these tracks
I milk for all my childhood, make me feel good
So I keep on writin meditatin in the ghetto
Makin love waitin for lost minds to settle
Then I speak out, because we all need the guidance
Deep down inside us where you could define science
My mother told me, when I was so stressed out
"All you gotta do is just put your best out"
And I did it, milky
Milk this cow (2X)
Milk this cow, the best way we know how
Park Hill projects, chicka-POW!


Hold your own nigga, Razor Sharp with the art
Don't gettin blown nigga, throwin darts at the charts
Danger Zone nigga, Cappadonna
You know the stee' potnah, Wu-Tang death before dishonor - what?


Yo, new Cappadonna is about to exhale kid
Hold all the phone calls, stop all the mail
Cappadonna raise hell, speak and I broke the shells
Seen brothers that fell when I slipped
I had my alibi tight that night, up in the Hill chillin
Y'all'll get shot, move away things are too hot
Look at my spot now, friends are exiled from close distance
I flow persistence, every time I step up, I rip reps up
Ku Klux, my words swing around like numchucks
This ain't for big bucks, never can quit this rap shit
It feeds my seeds, I can barely breathe
But y'all cats better believe keep off, the darts are soft
While I throw these missiles, at your skin tissue
You can't escape I absorb, gigantic crowds all aboard
Watch out for shitty fraud, my darts slam like doors
Makin it hard for you to get yours, selfish

 (x2)
Milk this cow, the best way we know how
Park Hill projects, chicka-POW!








Bad birds that fuck nerds! *inhaling*
Hah! *inhaling*
Suck a dick up til ya hiccup motherfuckers!
The swarm continues, Wu-Tang Killer Beez
Cappadonna Cappucino, the Donna-mite
Came to treat your earpiece right
Y'all better recognize and realize
Hot Nixon, playin my position, bitch!

*gunfight*




Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home


Yeah yeah they want me locked down, fryin' in jail
Before you hear that I decided to tell, I'd rather die in a cell
I was framed like a wedding flick, 2 time felon
Still a predicate, doin' time, tell 'em that's a negative
Prejudice judge, bails be a mil' in cash
Scorin' money like the meter on the Yellow Cab
Give the witness an unexpected visit
Make his story change like walls blockin' his vision
Couldn't give a clear description, fearin' the repercussions
Like, "I was on the ground, I ain't see him bustin'"
Now the DA chasin' a plea, they hatin' I'm free
The case is mistaken identity


Whoever push me like Pusha T, I push back
I push a cap, before '93, I pushed crack
I'm hood, black, you know me well, what's good, scrap?
I'm smokin' rappers, you are a L, what's good Smack?
Hold up that's Goodz rap, pardon self
I just like good rap, but when I see Goodz I give his goods back
I rap for writers that pack strap to rhymers that backpack
To 25 to lifers that jack MAC
We movin' ratchets, no Kat Stacks, it's magic
The way we flip the package before the coppers can catch it
I'm past that chapter in life, let's live it lavish
When life take a piss in your bed, you flip the mattress
Before you try and get my head, get you some Pampers
Then take a long look at my ish and get your answers
Kick in my vicinity, I'm what rappers pretend to be
Charge 'em with a penalty, mistaken identity


Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy


Fresh off of work, he jumped out the van
Two suitcases, dangle from his hands
He opened up the door, headed up the stairs
Thought he heard a noise, but no one else was there
First sight he saw, struck him by surprise
Two shots was given, between his girl's eyes
Windows blown out, no prints on the door
All he seen was blood stains, smear the damn floor
911, ambulance showed up
Blood everywhere, paramedics throwin' up
Cops cuffed him up, hit him with the charge
But he was bangin' Mrs. Prixy at the Motor Lodge
He got his alibis, gonna use 'em all
He screwfaced the judge, he might take the fall
Someone set him up, a botched robbery
Mistaken identity, yeah it gotta be


17 years old, I'm headed back to the hole
I'm mistaken identity, every way was sold
I look like a hoodlum, I rock a lot of gold
They lockin' everybody up, ship your ass up the road
I ain't have a 9 on me, they was lyin' on me
Court day with my old bird, they was spyin' on me
Tried to set me up, plantin' coke in my pocket
The beast pat me up, they won't let me off


Na-n-n-n-n-nah it wasn't me
It could never been the G-O-D, not me
You terribly mistaken, son, I ain't the one
We could never look nothin' like, whether near or far sight
What resemblance does he strike? So my mic Fahrenheit
W for my a-alike, your DNA match tight
Even if they bite us, close but not quite
They still tryna get it right, mistaken identity


Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy



Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
Wanna go home..
Wanna go home..
Wanna go home..
Wanna go home..


Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy




Walk with us... Code:Red, speak up


I'mma set it from the front of the door and let it be known
That I'm, settin' it straight and I'm comin' back home
Cuz I told ya'll, the tank top hustle a lot
But I'm a little dude and I still muscle the block


Aiyo, we comin' for the blocks, the aves and the streets
The team stay on the grind cuz the fam gotta eat
Dimes get bagged and sealed like it was work
And ain't nothin' safe get ya teflon shirt


Street life, drugs shit, money comes in bundles
Thug shit, and terratorial rumbles
Guns and in vintage, Don sweaters
We love phat whips, exotic bitches, new Code:Red leathers


Aiyo, my hood hate theyself
The bitches love Don', cuz they mate theyself
And niggas can't snake me, so they snake theyself
And they just pussy to me, they rape theyself and they take theyself


Money, cash, flows and bitches!


Aiyo, it's busy on the strip and they ain't too much rule
So how many M.C.'s must I consume?
Open up a nigga like a pussy womb
So nigga, call ya orangutang Goons and baboons


Who the fuck are you? That'll crew with me and two
Maybe more, can't come, fuck, kick down your door, son
You can have beef and not know it
Some gas in a bottle with a rag, then light it and throw it


We love, grindin' the honies and makin' the moneys
Toss it up, lovely, breakin' the twenties
And broke crews for a rap song, bakin' the sunnies
Lay back lovely, shakin' the bunnies


It's the reason why they put me here, to blast off
Cuz the rap game suck and I'm ready to crash course
With an O-1 'Rari, smoked and tinted
Who you know that shoot best when he's smoked and bented?




Yo, I'll jump in my whip, yo and run you over
Pass the weed and the Dutch to the ciga-r roller
From the Stat', with the shoulder strap holder
Fuck Beans, fuck Free, fuck The Roc and Hova


Fuck the cops and The Roc, I'mma do whatever
I come through rock a little wear, shoot who ever
It's a Struggle, that's why I told ya'll I bubble
Buck a thing, bust a thing, if you see I'm in trouble


Aiyo, I spit like a baby, a dog with the rabbies
Bowlin' hot gravy, get spilled we too ill
With the pill, emphatic slam
Crunch to the Lo, to the rap, from the Stat's who I am


Code:Red Entertainment
I'm not just a client, I'm also acquinted
Real respect real and it's all non-tainted
Handcuffed in the courtroom, bitin' the plaintiff
Run from the arraignment




Yeah, man, aiyo Slash
You tell Jay, right, that we gon' get this joint poppin' right
Lo gon' come with us in a minute, call Shockey up
And then we gon' rock it out, knawhatimean?
So, just in case, you got bucked, you make sure he got that thing
And we gon' move, let's go baby, right here, move..




Yeah, the mothafucking bookie, holding down my rights
You dig? Eyeballs on this nigga (Capp I see you)
One time for your mothafucking mind (Let's tear this shit up)
We bout to get out of order right now (What the flying fuck is goin on?)
Yo, yo, yo, yo


We gon shut this game down and move unheard
"When ya'll ready, ready, ready to rock"
We gon shut this game down and move unheard
"Rock with it if you overstand"
We gon shut this game down and move unheard
"When ya'll ready, ready, ready to rock"
We gon shut this game down and move unheard
"Stop playin mayne, bring it back now"


I Mash Out like Danze and Fame, me and my comrades snatch the game
And blast the flame, the General, that's the name
I get bills, still snatch the chain, and snatch ya dame
Where I'm from, we all act the same
I move ninja before you can flash the frame
Gangsta boogie, up jumps the boogie
With twin Glock nines and a Champion hoodie


Yo thats me in the grind, I'm always gritty
Staten Island, I represent New York City
And where I come from, son it ain't no joke
There's fires in the building, you get killed by smoke
And if you not alert, it's like Berlin, when we goin bezerk
Hustlin again, puttin in hard work
Time to bring everybody back together like it's the new church
New Mass!




Jets in the city, my rep get checks in the city
With all my connects in the city, my set get gritty
Name hold weight like I bench seven fifty, you craps better get me
We gon ride for it, do or die for it
Catch a homicide for it, never swicth sides for it
Might spit a clip in your face
We hungry, we eats the crumbs and lick plates


Now when the Europeans came, we flexed our skills
We used to be poor, but now we pay the bills
Some of ya'll vultures rob and kill just to eat
We in the streets, tryin to live our lives
Me and my hood peoples in the hills like East Berlin
Hold pens through hotels, mountain lions
Move on them like they did to the Mayans
Big irons for the sake of those thats at rest
Lebanon Don, Inspectah Deck
These niggas don't understand us, but show us respect




Joe Young, Wu-Tang, gonna bubble you hard
You weaklings, I told ya'll niggas from the start
We'll tear you apart, you know what I'm sayin?
Come through in the black Navigator, come out, spray ya
Only thugs get shook, fuck the mayor
This is meyhem, third world war shit
Ya'll niggas want competition, buy my rap kit
Peace to Banga, Danja and Deck
These are Urban Icons, nigga, show respect before I show you the tech
I'm duckin high, niggas stay low
Before I step through you niggas like the Stargate hole
Who want war? Smash ya face on the floor
Take from the rich and give to the poor
I rhyme sick, I shoot because of Sickamore
Your hoe wants dick or more
I'm on some shit, like, stick em all, kick in the door






Yo, your boy Born back, one hot track
Another masterpiece for all my hood niggas
The sting in the street, trying to survive, man
We gotta get right and take care of fam
So we hustle son, and play the block heavy
I never snitch and never ran, when the chops sweat me
I earn my stripes, listen, from the streets to prison
Niggas know me, dog, and my divine mission
I got the game now, like me and money green
On the compound, yo, this a lock down
And yea as clear as dawn and harm city Born
Reppin' B-More for life, with that heat drawn
I'm bout to take off boy, light years gone
Lightspeed on, I breeze by, like whooo
The way you going, to the top, man
I can't stop fam, can't you niggas, tell?
Look at this cartel, we moving weight now
My CD's jamming like they told vows
My flow so different, with so many styles
Plus my voice ill, you boys better chill
Cuz my fam kill, shhh, don't squeal
Wheels peel out, and the darkness appear
Like roaches when they see the lights
You better get it right, cuz we ain't come to fight, ight?


Sick with the flows, I spit for hoes
I grind everyday, fuck cheeks in they holes
Spark my yae, I'm still ghetto, with t-shirts
Jeans hard and stiff, I don't give a fuck
Shit, my Skwad is thick, we don't fall back
Fuck, we in charge of the shit, fly suit, red Havana Joe's
Muslim oil, I'm hood, nigga, what? Man, you know I'm spoiled
New York City, what, you know I'm loyal
Baltimore City, I got love for you
Popped off the first time that I ever saw you
Murdaland mixed with New York music
It's something in the cosmic, making me use this
I move slick, jump over cunts, prostitutes bitch
Get up to my hair, the grooves is a bitch
The Better Life, more papers, hoes and fishsticks
Biscuits, sneak 'em in the club, icepicks
Me and Clayborne, yo, we keep us a nice chick
The police they ain't got us in they vicegrips


Chilling in a nice whip, staying on some real shit
Look kid, we got skills to pay the bills, and eat a meal, for real
Even if a nigga gotta get killed
I'mma get mine, fuck standing in that checkline, waiting on the government
I'd rather grab the tech nine, fuck, go through hard times
All the time, it's rough on the brother
Got the d's, to stick up hoes and my baby mother
Not a lover, I gotta use the rubber with the chick
Can't trust her, child support sending me case numbers
Game is sour, streets going under
Uh, money is power, we ain't getting younger
Yo, I'm like a lion with a five day hunger
And I shine like the sun, in the middle of summer
Uh, give me a beat and I flip that
Start a record label and show you how I did that
Give me some dat, you know it cost niggas some stacks
Plus a nigga did it from scratch
Used to be pushing them cracks, when a nigga had
BBS's on the Ac', caught a flashback
Grown now, speaking on facts
Still talk slow when I rap, my nigga Cap
My nigga Born in the back
Wu-Tang, Clayway, what's fucking with that?


My gang gon' kick ya'll ass
My gang gon' kick ya'll ass
My gang gon' kick ya'll ass
And stomp ya'll niggas out


Yeah, the Better Life Movement
Masterminds Productions
Your boy DJ Fontane, Clayway Records
You know how we hold it down
Wu-South, uh

Imma twist another niggas sandwich
And get managed
Puff after puff
My star goin demand this
Reports, numbers, autographs and cameras
Im on the scanners
Murdering the crowds with good manners
Its a lot of rap bandits
Not ready to be candidates
But lets handle this
Show them how to dismantle this bitch
When I spit
 gotta submit
Prophet
Always on top of this shit
Hunger it
7 days and 7 nights
You need to settle it
When I was the coach of that dump
I used to meddle yeah
Pitbulls is everywhere
Yo my kettle is thick
 keeping the booker for real tea
You cant race me
Gotta embrace me
Im hood
Everytime I hear the beat
Up in everybody hood
Everybody know ol g
I hold the microphone
Plus I got the rosary
So when we murder my enemies
Nigga Im supposed to flee
Back in this fly
Where nobody can see
Feds got to reason with the kid
Till the pyramids
Bout to return
Will come back like jesus did
Street conquerors
Young life, young sponsorers
Bout to run up in the spot
Touch down and get bonkerers


Youre irrelevant
Getting sick informally
Until im normally
Act off and coast
And pose, you see my karma be
Vibrant, uh huh
It makes me live
When I walk up bank
And take all of your bread
Doin nuttin level
And now we got a night cover
Party like the same eyed doe is 
Just a second to go
Yo man you dealing with
Businessmen, enterprise, niggas that flow
We got king cash sense
We add cents
For many we the federal laws
My cash spent
Ma sober manner
Stealin in ma farm grammar
Clone shit to grow
Fertilize it with a banner
Watch me up worth double
I put my nut work
Rap into a huddle
Man you little tryin big niggas is big trouble


I been anointed with the holy oil
Flow the ink, lets me think clearly
Wondering minds
Fastforward not rewind
Plan to do the flashbacks
Futuristic preparations
Now I know how to react
Facing facts, not fantasy
Virtual reality
Meditate, moment of clarity
Proposing hits
Increasing my salary
Overcoming technicalities
Daddys little girl, mamas pearl
So im prepared
For the ugly beasts in this world
But now I got my arsenal ready
Keeping my strong arm steady
Goal getting, trendsetting
Captivating
So amazing
Trailblazing
Persevere through the chaos
Now Im leaving the booth blazing


Im back from the dead
Like Fred Kruger
Original head shooter
Get head on the bed
With the let in Aruba
I took drugs that Michael had
And slept for days
Came back and told Cap
I was rappin with dad
But now Im like fuck it
I keep my cool
And if you test
Imma eat your food
Yall niggas dont know my streets
Fuck boy, Im Statens most pop
You dont know my peeps
Kept it quiet for a minute
Stayed away from the beat
But I tell you one thing
I had to pay for my heat
So I lounge in the cut with shells
It aint hard to tell
I got that ill shit, sour smells
Car kill hooligan who used to wild out
Ow I wanna shoot again
Either or
You or him
A ferry boat (boat)
I buss one online
Im on 17s
You on them old times
Yeah
Uh huh






Brother, I think that necklace is causing you too much trouble


My necklace had the whole crowd on some next shit
The guest list full of real niggas that's hectic
The charm piece made my niggas move like calm beasts
Palm beats, two jostling niggas with long reach
Keep your eyes open for them strong on thieves
Out here looking for ice to put in they teeth
Chain glowing shining and I'm ready for beef
Like my nigga 2 Chainz, cappuccino from the east
From the Wu-Tang Clan, my necklace and my heat
Bang bang, different robe every day of the week
2 Angels, dinner plate, fat dollar sign
Universal flag on, nigga, I got shine




I keep my neck frozen, .45 loaded, please don't approach this
Rope is so ferocious, diamonds that shine in oceans
Keep you arm distant from my carats, silly rabbits
Make me get my barrel, spazzed out and cause havoc
Iced out Cubans, exotic stones from Africa
This the real thing, big bling, the chain swing
Try to swipe mines, that's a no no, the God's loco
Jewelry truckin' fancy spend stacks upon Delancey
Exhaust pipes coughing horse kicks
ACP's dress up the flesh, now the crime scene's gorgeous
My links is unbreakable, told y'all on the Purple Tape
40 inches hang from my neck, nigga, I'm wealthy




Why you say that?
It's real, kill a nigga for this shit
Aha, yo relax sis


Dinner plates rings, smothered in 2 pounds of dope
Eric B on the cut when it blings
Scrubbin' chain down in Colgate, double edged bangers
On they hips I wait in the jaw break
The snakes and the violators, Dracula style takers
We got a bunch of gold balls, but we ain't the Lakers
Hey bitches, stay lickin' my necklace
And I ain't even put the dumb bitch in the guest list
That's what you get when you throwin' on Cuban's
Drawers that's made from silk, a robe and a Ruger
Crack heads catchin' a sweet vix on a scooter
Catch me for my chain, it belongs on a shooter
Lucky my shit blow like a horn on a tuba
You might as well do me now cause I will do ya




God-Cipher-Love-Divine in math 79
Bright yellow and dense in its gift and shine
Still the same when exposed to air and water
Like when amongst thieves you  travellin' across the border
The brink of the metal link when in transition remains solid
The message was lost in transmission
That's often in a free elemental form
Nuggets and grains and rocks and things that's norm
Malleable ductile metal on many levels
Get you shot for a Flintstone, killed for a pebble
Lieutenants and Generals move with criminals
The pride for all in line, they hunt for mineral
The scope is on the rope, claws on the table
Brass knuckle, knees buckle, legs unstable
And it's sold by the weight
Shaped into a plate with food on it
The hungry wolves lie in wait




Tu Tin-To. So you're the tigers of Tinan, bastard, you're gonna pay for this, you'll die here. I'll use the tiger strike to kill you all. I'll show you the three different strokes. Forest Tiger! Win Tiger, Winmau Tiger!




Yeah
This where we at
That's right man
Scrape that pot
(?)
You already know what it is
This one is for the kids
Yo


I'm not trying to be bragging
But I ain't have a lot
I came up from the street
I used to live in the spot
All my homies that I know
We used to hustle and sell blow
And its like I don't even like to talk about it no more
But its my life
And its how I used to live
Now I do what I got to do to feed my kids
Make me want to jump on something, do another sting
But if I slip on that, I'm going to be in the bing
And my queen, she don't understand
I tell her to chill
But that's why Jack didn't want to be with Jill
(?) still bill, all of my dogs too
We just always want to eat better
Move around different places and sleep better
Get paper, floss lovely and spark the bubbly
Its our nature to be the best at what we create
Now lets make a wager
We got the flavor, chicks love us (That's right)
How we put it in, yah come here pudding
Everything is on point
Me and my nigga (?) roll joints
The misfits
My thoughts lose it
I make music and play stupid
Do something, never knew I'd do it
Uh


You can tell
I'm from the fast time
Just to get by, just to pass time
My momma ain't raised no fool
All of my niggas did past crimes
All of my dogs dead
Now you on your family thing
Represent no matter what
Don't throw away the ring


Stomach hurting, I'm still flirting
Being the world surgeon
For some reason yo I wasn't certain
Never gave up on my sacrifice
Just to see my squad working
I'm still net surfing
(x2)


You could feel like the vapors
Open up your jugular vein like razors
Baby
Dream make up
Skyscraper
Stop niggas in motion
Like a taser
Hi hater
Street code lay low
Connect clientele together like Lego
This muscle, with no muzzle
Super Bowl, last down no huddles
Godfather
Niggas don't believe
Till you bring the heat like lava
My poverty in HD
(?)
And we the definition of wave
Shots of action like Scorscese
Money the theme, Illuminati bar codes
Power in numbers
When you hunting for the green


Stomach hurting, I'm still flirting
Being the world surgeon
For some reason yo I wasn't certain
Never gave up on my sacrifice
Just to see my squad working
I'm still net surfing
(x2)


I remember when I used to be a little shorty
I thought I knew it all
I thought i had the answers to everything
You couldn't tell me nothing
I was one of them little smart bad little niggas
Snot nosed
Huh
Yeah I just knew I had all the answers
Huh
You think about that




CHAMBERMUSIK.Com, boy!
Peep the paralized talk, uh-huh
Peep the paralized talk, uh-huh, huh, huh, huh
Peep the paralized talk, huh
Peep the paralized talk, huh, huh, huh


Peep the paralized talk, Ranita cousin Grimes
They say he got dealings, in New York City's recent
Alphabet crimes, what's funny
Son down south in North Caroline, cracked out
Destroyed in his mind, it puzzles me sometimes
How the feds, never got the whole story
Put pretend, like every hand's in place, like the afro of Robert Horry
This old lady rose, swift on her toes
Pushing the forties, Glock nines, tray fevers
Up north niggas, check her out, when they come home
To get their first diva, Uncle Peter fix your old station wagon
But part timer'll break down and cleaning all your cannon
Uh, you can say my family, like the black Sopranos
Between the paraphernalia cycles, domestic violence channels
Seen a lot of Supreme Court panels
I ain't saying I'm scared of the people, shit
This for the people, I come across, like an animal
But'll front, and break you down and beat you deaf like an anvil
The weather's so hot, but, my family want blood
I'm standing so on top, like the A-Bomb
And want blow, bigger, nigga


I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it... fucker...
Ya'll niggas ain't ready for me, man
Stand behind that nigga, when we come gunning for him
We gonna hit your bitch ass, too


Swerve like a samurai, nigga
Tam or ride, nigga, you up on your own, nigga
You gon' have me put one all up in your bones, nigga
Stupid, what's really wrong, man?
How many times I gotta tell you I'm running this shit for real, man
I'll come through your hood, blow you out, in your hood
In front of your barbershop, in your hood
I ain't try'nna..... get down with you
Relate to you... feel me? In any way, move with you
You ass, nigga, we know already
You ain't never bust nobody, you ain't never clapped nobody
You hear, you hear, what's wrong?
What you think this is a game? These Killa Mob niggas'll
Throw the toast to your nose, plus
Bust sperm in your dame, shit
I'm real McCoy with it, street level, heroin of Roy with it
Mow 'em down, move 'em on, move 'em on, mow 'em down, nigga, it's on


Fuck, man, what's good, nigga, I'm running this man
I got my own Mob, doing my thing, nigga I move too smooth, man
Ya'll niggas try and follow, man, hehehe, ya'll niggas stupid, man, go
Head, nigga


Feds hit the mansion last week, on some King Kong
Shots tapping on the door, like it was ping pong
Shells hit the door bell, it went ding dong
I couldn't take it no more, I dropped my ring-ding
Flashbacks in my mind, visions of Sing-Sing
Cut your face...

Tell Mel Shawn to come in
Word, yo, one life to live
It's on your head
Just like my daughters
That's my word!
Polka dot
Connection
Shine just apostle


Yo, my whole body like a spoiler kid, draped in the latest hits
Both hands, two glass cutters, cops'll alter this
Cream of Wheat steez pushed back, we in a spaceship
Like the Jetsons, ashtray slide refreshments
Automatic bubble yo, straight off the Benz
Dac double Daniel unrockable fam milk the same yo
Fuck you, Duel of the Iron, Tony win a Oscar
Legendary rah, wicked Phantom of the Opera
Blow fish the movie's over, die with a slow kiss
Tongue kiss the neck and it's, mucus from a locust
Stand on fly, Mel-a-chi is on standby
The Y chormosome with the X that multiplies, yo


Word on block is that half the King Killer Beez
Rap's under seige, Guyanese guns
I got European funds, my ice don't melt
Shaolin is felt, mathematics is my rod
And my staff, I pray like this
I break mics in half, shit realism
Fuck Moet and baguettes, that get paid off
Or get laid off, I spray New York
I'm an angel, at war with the rappers
Good black women sleep over at Cappa's
I fall into it, Mr. September
Rock my long FUBU shirt in the winter
I respect my kind, plus pack a nine
Daytime outfit superb outlet
Staten Isle in effect, y'all in the manor
If you can feel Don down it Atlanta
I'm a poet, my work is never done
Law of Park Hill, my mic is stage one
Fifty-five tribes, in Psalms 30
Caution, sometimes my thoughts get dirty
Somethin precise, hold back the pressure
My unit too nice, you only got one life
To live, think twice
(Think twice think twice twice twice twice)


Yo, aiyyo we swindle, make moves, PJ out the window
Flamingo, Santa Domingo, let's Kringle
Bruce Wayne diggin graveyard rocks and swingin
Multimillions, rap pavillion stay G'in


This year, we throw darts in the air
To let y'all know this shit is severe
Ohhhhhhh Donnn-na, Ohhhhhhh Donnn-na


Dove nice Mary Jane bitches Bud Light
Co-production I spoke to Christ, shoes were light
Statueheads all up in my lab like mad
Empty bags are lyin in the yard, welfare
Dead weight yo, cables that clamp around the neck
Sucrets fast Corvettes, tecs on my rest
Sabotage, rap motor large, Mickey caught a charge
Credit card scam, when he couldn't rock the Wu skull
Fuck yeah, televise the shit on Fox
Big Ghost'll grab the jim and un-fasten your box'
You're allergic to the fungus on Earth, Killer Bee
Headquarters is work, Khadafi body in his turf
Yo, shame on, all y'all niggas on some Baywatch shit
Soundin like me, suckin my dick
Pretty Tone, long live the great Cappadon
Cappadon...


... as I get it on
I'mma take time to wait for y'all niggas to stop
It ain't enough room for y'all cats to sound chop
In a class by myself I hold the foundation
Face to face, I make my affiliation
Short and brief, I make out with the looseleaf
In the struggle, ten years after the beef
I choose to come forth then pronounce my sin
If it's not the felonies or the color of my skin
I'mma keep switchin my gear, again and again
From the trainin camp I drive past V.I.N
It be Wu-Wear for life, my team is top billin
More sacrifices, create better livin
My darts came to save the world like Blue Ribbon
Protect seeds, and protect black women
Raised in the Pillage right now we just driftin
Ferry boat niggas make a whole lotta difference
Drama, if you slackin up in the business
Godly from the Group Home always got biscuits

Ohhhhhhh, Donnn-na (repeat 4X)

"A killer should not be known, he must be discrete - understand?"



(Cappadonna)
Tell Mel Shawn to come in and lose The Game
Word, yo, one life to live
It's on your head
Just like my daughters
That's my word!
Polka dot
Connection
Shine just apostle

(Ghostface)
Yo, my whole body like a spoiler kid, draped in the latest hits
Both hands, two glass cutters, cops'll alter this
Cream of Wheat steez pushed back, we in a spaceship
Like the Jetsons, ashtray slide refreshments
Automatic bubble yo, straight off the Benz
Dac double Daniel unrockable fam milk the same yo
Fuck you, Duel of the Iron, Tony win a Oscar
Legendary rah, wicked Phantom of the Opera
Blow fish the movie's over, die with a slow kiss
Tongue kiss the neck and it's, mucus from a locust
Stand on fly, Mel-a-chi is on standby
The white Puma's go with the X I multiply yo

The precinct is crooked.  My man got grabbed up
Had cracks on him worth about a bullet
They just took it, asked him a few questions like, "Where the guns?"
They tried to G him to tell them where was Un (how they come?)
Ten deep in a red 15 Passenger
Guns out when they jumped out, pointed at us
Here comes what they call a procedure
Slammin' us against a gate, cuffin' us before they beat us


It's like they can't trust us, they wanna bust us and rush us
They sayin' "F" us.  There's no peace, no just-us
They claim to protect us, they serve and they wreck us
Never respect us, arrest us and always stress us

To see the Devil die is my purpose of 
Self-determinance is the must, I practice Kujichagulia
Yo, free your mind and yo *bitch* is sure to follow
And when freed men come to lock it down, look out for tips that's hollow


It's P.I.T. Soprano
Mix it down, dedicated to Steve Feliciano
Directed at Steve McGarrett and Danno
F' the 5-0 pronto cause I know
First head to take the white and burst lead
Never did but might have to do it
Lies, twenty-five, hollow shots in a pro-active unit
Exit 7A, NJ stop the BS movementthat's how we do it
Mobilize the people, conscious *niggas* get to it


My people unite and let's all get down
We gotta have what? Love, peace, and understandin'
One god, One love, One light
One aim, One voice, One fight


My people unite, hop up, and do it right
We gotta have what? Love, peace, and understandin'
One god, One love, One light
One aim, One voice, One fight
My people unite, hop up, and do it right
Do it right ya'll, keep it tight ya'll, do it right ya'll, just do it


Yo, forget police brutalityI work for a salary
And did time for a crime I didn't commit
They tried to beat me in my head, make a brotha submit
Hit me in the face with sticks, lockin' me down for bein' around
I still remember.  Never surrenderin' to the beast
The man, peace for Diallo
My reality is to fight back police brutality


Mr. Officer got me trapped in a dark corridor
Long hallway, they in love with the gunplay
Swing night sticks, run thicker than Bloods and Crips
Harass mad cats and it don't make sense
Roll around in dark tints, fiend to match fingerprints
Search me down everyday and you still ain't content


Oh-oh-oh-oh
Calm your nerves down, bop your heads too high
(Let 'em know, Rock) Stop wonderin' why you keep gettin' knocked
Cause you a part-time dealer, prob'ly a part-time pops
Part-time killer, but them dudes is full-time cops
Pick a hustle, stupid.  You half-*ass* black, act
Stab.  Use your head for more than a hat rack, jack*ass*
Start runnin' your life instead of runnin' the streets
Runnin' your mouth (oh yeah) and stop runnin' from peace

 (x4)
My people unite and let's all get down
We gotta have what?  Love, peace, and understandin'
One god, One love, One light
One aim, One voice, One fight




What's up, now, write a love song


The first time I saw you, it was love at first sight
No DJ, the crowds or the cordless nights
It was just me, I stood in front of you with the ice
You had rooms at the hotel, I asked you the price
You smiled at me, it was ever so bright
I got your name and your number, called you the same night
Me and this other chick, we're just having a fight
You said hit you up whenever, you can make things alright
We hit the club out in Towsden, Yellowman performing
I held your hand tight, made your feelings start pouring
Every hour's incredible, not a minute was boring
That's what I like to do when I ain't out there touring


Babe I hope you're calling me, tonight
I wanna be with you, oh yeah, hey baby
I just wanna lay with you tonight
I wanna be with you, alright, hey baby


Girl, I'm all caught up in a one night love affair
But I be acting like ya'll don't care
And no matter where you at girl, I'm always trying to be there
Creep with you, even if it's only for the weekend
Down in Baltimore, the fly spot eating
Sometimes we be together just talking that love shit
Like when I meet chicks at the club and shit
It's not the same, I crush those hoes, I ain't playing games
Cuz I don't want niggas to know that we on the low
Sex on the roof, sex at the most
Sippin' on Mo', you know you love how Original flow
We caught up in a one night love, and I can't let go




You might see me in the mall scoring
Butter Pecan Ricans, with the fly Chocolate Deluxe
Money ain't a thing, I might still spend a few bucks
But you know Don, I wanna crush til the sun come up
Breakfast on the beach, baby, the eggs all done up
Hold you by the waist, while I suck your whole tongue up
I'm caught up in a one night love, all strung up
I might run after the chicks, sometimes it just wait
Chill at the crib, and take 'em out for a date
Keep it on the hush, and whatever we do, girl
It's all between us, we got a good understanding
We don't need trust, we laugh, you tell jokes, sparking a Dutch


Oh, love be, so special, so let's make love tonight






Speak wit I'm em, I'ma watch this
Ah ah ah, Cappa, Cappa
Keep ya head to the sky
(Keep ya head to the sky)
Keep ya head up
(Some things might just change, right?
Keep ya head to the sky)
Ya hear?


Keep ya head to the sky, not for a mystery God
But times are hard, take a look around
Poor people treat ya brother as a equal
Snuffin to be found on the ground
These ain't the faces of a clown
We the meak, God bless us whenever I speak
My job is to teach, even if I drink, sex on the beach
My mind is still in reach
Never too far away from the pains of today
And I say, comin in, my brothers gotta pass away
Before we come together and pray, God is the way
One of my sisters ran astray, jail with my people is the long hallway
I see it like the eyes of Kunta Kente, we all gon' pay
Children away from judgement day
I respect Jah Selaseai, some things money can't buy
And I tell you no lie, keep ya head to the sky


Keep ya head to the sky, keep ya head to the sky
Some things money just can't buy
Keep ya head to the sky, keep ya head up
Keep ya head to the sky, keep ya head to the sky


Only the flesh die, but the soul is forever
I'm all for God, lovin the father, don't bother
If you can't follow, mind's are hollow
Never a thug, even though I sold drugs to survive
It's all over, now I'm sober, I'm not a Roc-A-Fella or Jay-Hovah
I'm just one soldier similar to P, I shed light
G-O-D to the fullest, these thoughts are like bullets
Hit you out the ordinary but don't worry
I'm like the fort singin on the ferry
The fairy Godfather from Park Hill
Trynna to rip the face off a bill
Now it's God will, like a ex-crack head said
I'm like a fed, stuck in my head be the real information
What out for Satan, waitin for you, hatin for you
You a thug or a blood, get ya mine outta The Flood
It's mine, I'ma flood, tryin to show y'all love
I'm trynna rise above, ain't no time for crime
These the bad days of time, under oath I can't lie
And if I die, rhymes will spend you on right
Be strong, keep ya head to the sky


Keep ya head to the sky, keep ya head to the sky
Keep ya head to the sky (Whoa, whoa)


Divine, I can see in ya mind
Choppin wit ya mental, praises been due
Thanks praise what I've been to, it's real
Sign by the 'Ville, dude without a deal
With God I'm survivin, it's not about drivin the Benz
I got the ends, but I still need friends, so I can share my love
Forget a club, brother push come to shove
I'mma cry for my mother in the Hill, helped me to build
On times are to ill, only she could make the black man chill
Even not to steal, drivin through Park Hill
Most of the time I was high, wildin for a small piece of the pie
Me and Ghost sat down and ask ourselves why
Did time in jail, when everythin else seemed to fail
Most started the bail, it was hard to get the mail
And separated from my seeds, now I'm tellin the tale
Cuz in the fire I preceeded to burn
Then my father bless me wit another turn
He taught me to be more concerned
Like a grandmother makin me learn
At one sixty, that's how it it is
It's not about show biz
We deal in the orphanage, keep ya head to the sky


It's a privelage, keep ya head to the sky
Keep ya head to the sky (Buck buck buck buck, whoa)
Keep ya head to the sky (Why? Keep ya head to the sky)
Keep ya head up (Whoa) Keep ya head to the sky
(What? Buck buck buck buck buck)
Jah Selaseai (Buck, you will make it)
Keep ya head to the sky (You know you been
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you been partyin
You been eatin pork, keep ya head to the sky
What? Whoa) Blood to see, we out
(Whoa, whoa, whoa) Gods who respect
(Whoa, you, whoa) Check it out
(Buck buck buck buck) You know
No hatred, no hatred, go head
(You made it) Just keep ya head to the sky
Keep ya head to the sky, keep ya head to the sky
(Buck buck, whoa, whoa, whoa
You know you made it, whoa
Whoa, keep ya head up, whoa
Keep ya head up high) Yo




Our House is a very very very fine house
With two cats in the yard, life used to be so hard
Now that everything is easy cuz of you


From the crack sales and the cocaine scales
From Mickey D to sales, the block done shifted
Let's realize, we was all born young and gifted
Sippin' wine in the Christenings, after church Sunday dinners (uh-huh)
Lies in the magazines, on how rap music gon' let us live good
Please believe, I'ma always live in the hood (yeah)
How could you point in fault when some of us know nothin' but the hood?
Adapted from the past, Kani they got your pictures on the benefit cars
No more givin' you foodstamps from Nana's cornbeef hash (uh-huh)
To the backyard boogie grass (come on, come on)




Eh yo yo we gon' bounce wit it, wit it and come around wit it
Park Hill, Body Brighton, yeah we come in town wit it
Staten Island, Lounge get it, watch how the pound, grip it
Smoke Jones, come with the toast and plus an ounce wit it
Y'all niggas stupid dog, what you not feelin' kid?
Heard you got a grudge with the bee as if I killed ya kid
Goon Squad enter the garden, ya best protect ya wig
And it's Beezy, Beezy, stay easy
My Far Rock cats in the back they stay greezy
And O.T.F. niggas, yeah they still B.B
Crunch Lo, Molly and Wigz, and Mr. C./me
Ain't nothin' changed, y'all been here for a minute
Win in it, bitch




Eh yo Our House used to be infested with roaches
See 'em in our cereal, poppin' up out of our toasters
We shared the same clothes, pickin' our dirty nose
Socks smellin' like shit, dirt between our toes
We had it fucked up but that's how we was rose
Stealin' cakes and candy from outta C-Town
Takin' a stankin' ass yellow piss with our seat down
Mamma smoked coke, should could pop a dope
My sister fuckin' bitches, come on Teresa cope
My hood is filled with butchers, crack and dope pushers
S-stash it in they ass or in the front bushes
Life is still hard, fuck a used to be
Suck my fuckin' dick, cuz you ain't used to me
Get in a Benz van like everything is easy
I keep it gully though because my hood need me
And I don't give a shit if y'all don't wanna feed me
I put the nine on you, Goon Squad motherfuckers might grind on you
Fuck a pitbull, I sic a lion on you
Two cats in my yard, that's my Goon Squad
I'm from special ed., call me a retard
Dirt bomb niggas, you know my street card
Straight garbage picker and dog food eater
Dingy dungerees, holes in my new sneakers
Shit in my elevator, shit in my drawers too
If you was hangin' wit me you'd shit in your's too
You'd shit in your's too..






Pain is love, that's what this nigga told me
I keep washin' my face with blunts and O.E
Mix coke with dust, still can hold me
What made ya muthafuckas think you control me?


Staten Island been wildin', so Osama's nothing
And my niggas out in Brooklyn said Saddam was frontin'
Gotta squad, what you think, it ain't no guns or something?
Picture Me Rollin', holdin' less than a one or somethin'
You fake faggots, yeah we got that big automatic
Like, Bruce Willis and the Jackal type, yeah, right
You wanna see it? Then get on my nerves
Oh you live, and I'm gettin' money spit on my curb
In the hood where it get no harder, only tougher
Crack fiends suffer, baby moms, baby brother
Hustlin', still forty off a hundred packs
I'd rather lounge in the back of the bar
Me and my dog throw crack in the jar
Listen to this rap star, while I sit back in the car
And I told ya'll niggas how the Staten rock
We don't, trick on chicks, yo we clap them shots
You get caught if you ask a lot, like you don't know
And where you at, then ya ass is got




We bringin' back the Twin Towers, 20-0-3, crack game electronic
Conceived with slow jams by The Delfonics
At a level that you should of been years ago
Responsible usually for coke traffic, usually for broken bone tragic
Rest in peace, to Mayor Guliani's term
They say I'm wrong, shit
I'm try'nna see 26, with my daughters at the Emmy Awards
All around the ball glowin', they got the weed flow droughted
Or maybe niggas in the hood just ain't 'bout it
Talkin' Hercules, and ain't nothin' but dog food
Staten Island, New York City drools
Crazy glue on my fingerprints
Name on the concrete of my hood, what's really good?
Vendetta's with these rap stars
Frontin' like this crime and the pet is they cars
Believe I was God in my last life
What if it was your knife? What if they was your gloves, nigga..




Aiyo, I came into this game on some real love shit
And ya'll bitch ass niggas, ya'll wanted me to quit
Because the way I dress ill and the way that I spit
But I ain't never gon' stop, droppin' these joints
And ya'll fake ass niggas, ya'll ain't gettin' no points
Don't try to sabotage me, cuz you just can't do it
You had me in the Square, last year, but you blew it
Big Donna from the group home, that's my word
Splash shots at your whip, splash shots at your bird
Leave your brains and your Gucci boots up on the curb
Pillage for life, Allah's will be the most superb
Smoke weed with the cannon, smoke the herb
So bow down, all you crab ass clowns you can't live
My gun's on empty, but it's more shots to give
I pop you like a slave cop, run in your crib
Throw darts at your wife, throw darts at your kid
Leave your house flooded with hits like O.J. did
Escapin' the crime scene and you love how I slid






Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yeah, yo, yeah, yo


Catch me on yo' brochure with beachballs, at least three whores
Head wop Queens know how to work they jaws
They skintone is coffee and milk, mixed up
Ass as big as my boss' wife, stomach ripped up
Spitting liquor in they mouth, cold Moet
Captain Morgan, taking flicks, posing, holding my tech
With cowboy hats and coach bags, they party like rockstars
Bo Gary watches, just chill, they down in the shark bars
And me, gunslinger, clips, cock D
My fashion on, I'm rocking 'em new Rasheeds
I'mma finish ya, go in brother like Mr. Cee
You could find me fucked up like the mice in cheese
Life's a B, Bentley and big bills
Bottles, biscuits, bitches, blunts, bad boys bodying pit bulls
Karate, black belt and I bring booze
To big bar brawls, ball games blasting, fuck 'til my balls blue


We like the black Yankees, old vets who sit in the rest
Thankful, counting up currency and move when it rain, pour
From every bitch that we bless, we hit up, automatic love
The Cuban Link niggas is the realest
My wallet walk, speak to niggas, cops, judges
We put it down, Columbian style, with three killas
Based on money, dummies'll die
It ain't funny, trying to front on mine, we get in ya mommy
Keep cool, nigga, read him the rules, before he bleeding in pools
And fuck my shit up, and I'mma just lose
Paid a lot of paper to live here
American Gangster status, Big Brother, lemme get in ya ear
You know what time it is, crime it is
No matter what rhyme it is
We gon' stay fly, hit lye, rock diamond shits (no question)
Based on a general's fist of fury
Neck, arm, money, all of that's crispy jewelry


Let me show you how I g ride, nina on both sides
Nobody riding shotgun but the four-five
Nigga, if you won't try, I'll give ya something to regret
Throw that mothafucking semi to ya neck
Throw the other black Jimmy to ya chest
If you budge, you get stretched, nothing more, nothing less
Pay respect, I'm a element of Homicide Housing
In other words, bitch, I'm the resident from Homicide Housing
Known for drug dealing, stack thousands
Four hundred grand in the couches, two hundred grand on the houses
At any time I could move up out this
And go and cop some shit up in the moutains


Aiyo, aiyo, you know ya boy stay fresher than produce
Timberland snow boots, collecting more CREAM than a toll booth
I grind daily, Patriotic like Tom Brady
I'm the bomb baby, cuz what I write is beyond crazy
I'm the Don with the teflon armor, good karma, mac palmer
Call me Arab Diesel cuz I'm a track bomber
Roger that, my niggas ain't got it cracked
All we do is dollar stack, get twisted like bottlecaps
While you on the block getting indicted
We island hopping, globe trotting through the friendly skies flying United
There's a party over here and everybody's invited
The headliners is Theodore and everybody's excited


Fuck that, 'bout time we took it back to the block
The task force coming, I got crack in my sock
White Rock on the dinner plate, get cash, shit is hot
Smash whips on the Interstate, we dash on the cops
It's them dudes, drug slingers, 1-6-Ooh
Crime figure, rhyme spitter, his gun spit too
Call 'em Sex Pistols, ravishing, nigga, I'm Rick Rude
And ain't many mothafuckas could fit up in Rick's shoes
Man, listen, ice glisten, they love the life we living
That's a given, like football players love white women
White linen, a tight denim, that ass look right in 'em
Shit, I'm riding 'em, cool as Kahlua's with ice in 'em, shit...

 + (Cappadonna)
Aiyo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo I pass the mic to Cap (Nah, I pass it back)
Never, son, hold that, you the master of the rap attack
So knick knack patty wack (This is how we do it black)
(Slap you with the almanac) Where actual facts is sold as facts


We on our grown man shit like Quincy Jones
Travelling across the world while we smoking the bone
We grinding, y'all niggas know what we do
We get it in with the Murderland, Chi-town too
Hit you up, something nice 'til the death of Yakub
Swagger stuck on ya face like a New Jack tool
Right back at you, yeah me and my dude Toney
We don't fuck with fake contracts and niggas that's phony
Trying to get this money, right homey
And lay back in the Riverside, just chill, relax the domepiece
Link up with a fly dime, brick and a chrome piece
Coming for that gwop, yeah nigga, you got beef







Yeah

Gold teeth! That's real talk, my nigga, yo!


I started off 'cited, rhyme radic and it's evident
Hip hop ain't going nowhere while the Almighty is present
A nickel for your thoughts, 100,000 for these facets
All my comrades in the force
Strictly moving about your business
Never a question, fuck the tension, mind your ps and qs
Some used to dropping dimes 
Some used to copping pleas 
Cock back aim and squeeze let loose like what it do?
Now who you? Killa Beez swarm, guess who back home
With the gold chain military brandishing arms
Like word is bong
Can-I-Bus, what up? Let's get it on
Standing in the middle of the King of the Dot
Like fuck 'em all, we the greatest
Track record proven through song
What's beef? Medium well filet mignon
With a side of crock fried rice and sweet cream corn
They u'ed-a puttin' out a fucking album out trying to challenge the Gods
Chopping your swords

Almighty fundraiser, the "redrum" undertaker
2013, this another summer shaker
Earthquakes hit Yukadis, cicadas breathing poisonous vapors
Alien races descended from spaceships
Dangerous homostasis married to the matrices
Your soul is naked in the Synagogue of Sad
And his Satan is filled with hatred
Clint Eastwood gotta get a background check to buy ammo cases
Accidental racists in the eggshell White House
Signing Executive Orders to put your lights out
They don't care what your life is about
If you got something to say
The slavemaster gonna bite you in the mouth
Hip Hop war via active Chief Information Officer
Agent So-and-So wanna talk to ya
A robot brain is at the top of the food chain
The Anti-Christ is a pimp, technology is king! King!

Hold the mic like this is magic
You don't wanna fight me
Killa Beez on the swarm

More gold,  more ice
More swords, more vice

Who want what can get what and what not
Buckshot spackle your face right at the bus stop
Shots from 100,000 autos

Ya'll muthafuckas know who this be
It's Theodore, yo, let me hear somethin' my nigga
Let me hear something


We the champion, we spit like, top of the line
Hold weight while you still push nickel and dime
And my shine hold my stones than your local jeweler
More ice than a picnic cooler, Slick Wigs the Ruler
Round the raincoat, stash my gat in the car wash
How I got such a smooth flow, but I spit too harsh
Butter nut squash leather, big face cheddar
Don't fuck with no groupie, hid in a high school sweater
We rope rats, roll money stuffed in stacks
Rock show after show, and don't claim no tax
Got custom deep pockets and my pimpin' slacks
And my tephlon shirt, in case they got gats


Yo Wigs, this is Theodore, you know how we rock it


Trife Da God, show these niggas why they ain't poppin'


I'm not enthused, by these rap dudes
All in they videos, posin' half nude, with all of them tattoos
Til I blacken they eyes and have them lookin' like raccoon
Now they stuck tail, stuffed in they ass like a baboon
I do you dirty like a table chop, and the blocks on fire
These niggas be rockin' more wires than a cable box
Hit you with a fatal shot, lay you to rest
Get your cradle rocked, by two Glocks aimed to your chest
They say it's deep, and never lose his stripes
Well put his ass in a cage with this iron, bet he lose his life
I'm a beast like Priest Holmes, keep spittin' them weak poems
And I'mma wreck you and straight disconnect you like cheap phones
You can ride for you team and die with the marines
For tryin' to intervene, while I'mma tryin' to get this CREAM


Aiyo, knick knack patty wack, light up, twist a fatty jack
Four shotties, and playin' them lobbies where those cracks be at
Stay foul, break vows, niggas sniff gun pow-der
Check my caliber, make sure it register
Bring forth your head and stuff, don't wanna huff, puff
Or cuss, get stuffed in little bags, like angel dust
Check out the bangle cuts, double rocks, tangled up
And couples got bubbles, in the tub, lightin' the double Dutch
Hey, hey, hey, Ghostface and Donna Jay
Trife Dies', Killa Bamz, Wigs, Kryme got the yay'
All day, all up in your hood like court dates
Concealed heat, like a sheep dog or a NorthFace
Small space, more bass, polly like shore bait
Molly got four trays, and pinned dog with raw haze
Just like the old days, Willie Mays, with a low cut fade
Duster play the Giant, when I'm on stage


Pretty Tone, yeah I see you in the cockpit


Donna Jay, put his face in the dirt like an ostrich


Nah, I don't really have to spit nothin' to complex
I just rep for my hood, and it sound correct
It's mic checka, Juan Don, in the place to be
And I be playin' on these tracks, like one, two, three
One some Theodore shit, like it once was me
With the laid back shit, like the country be
Bone the hoes, all the time, smoke blunts with G
Goon Squad Hooligans, got fronts in Jeeps
Why you jealous muthafuckas gotta jump my beats
Trife Diesel and Ghostface dump they heats
In your face, real hard, straight lump they meats
Won't sell cracks to you, but I pump the streets
And tear pussy out the frame, while you hump the sheets
And I know ya'll niggas hate, and can't wait til I'm gone
That's why I keep drivin' on by, tootin' my horn
Da-da-da-de-da-duhhhh




Uh, yeah, Park Hill Productions
The belt, aiyo Peace God (Peace God)


Yo, I just came back from uptown, got a dozen of coats
Two ki's of Nikes and a platinum rope
Chrome with the microscope


What you wanna do?
I got a truckload of shit, everything is brand new
I got a rock that I caught from Tiffany's, fifty g's
And ten hot Bentley's from overseas
The color of leaf


Yo, Born, watch out for the thieves
Keep your third eye open, watch out for the thieves
Keep that gun by the knife, then we out in the breeze


Out in the breeze, larger than life
We got stacks over there, we'd rather snatch tonight
Make sure that paper right, while we breaking the ice


Breaking the ice, laying track, chasing the mice
Loading the trunk, you got five jet planes, we'll explode in the front
We don't hang around rats, waste money on stunts
We like Marriott Hotels, laying in cartel
Cream like Carvel, yo, my team got bars and shells


Bra-a-at.. that was it?
Uh-huh, this one is like a fresh pair of shoes
With some new tags...




Red dog ebonies, half Gotti and Lebanese
You see me posted, lifted like my tape to text
Poverty projects son, and I ain't scared to talk
Newport, five percent of New York, spray darts
Where you walk, cocoahead peers, throwin Shaolin spears
Floatin through the Village, trapped in, designed to shine
Pillage, war between the thug and the con
As for the father reborn, castle in the mind
Mind blind and captive, warfare be interactive
Bamz is savage hard to substitute
Smoke the hydro root, in a casual suit
I'm tryin to walk these dogs but I'mma dog myself
Get my wealth for delf, hard rock crews is so-low
Stagnate, thoughts of payin dues
Gotta prop the holes in my shoes, bare foot style
Is Shaolin Isle, spend Valentine in the cooler
Get the CREAM dula, figures and dollars
Stuck I make a thug holla, swarmin the bees who rock the Walla
Po-Po lookin for collars, peep the whole scene
Make it happen, Shaolin, dart clappin
Prepared for this war we assassins, but now I'mma chill
For a minute, smoke bones of hydronetic and get pathetic
Sources is similar to Voltron when we swarm
Rock my red cape like Spawn
Shaolin breathin in a hailstorm, teachers of Allah
Know it's best to quote the topics
Shaolin trees from prophets, representin Shaolin
We gonna die for this, so don't you never fail
Like crews who soul miss, temple doors open
And your death wish, peepin analyst
Bamz who got the mad new shit


The pillage, the pillage, the pillage
Oceanwide, Donna on the outside
Cyanide, killa bee hive, homicide
His side is gone, it's on, my uniform is Uno
Acapella was take two, respect due
No commercial I teach though, I reach those
Higher heights, mic to death, words of wisdom
Words of a architect strike, hype is the crowd
Down low is me, Bamz sugar free
Check we radical dub, nightclub punish the club
Attack hate runnin with love, better grub
Dick em down easy, past sound, pass out
Pass it around, grew up in The Tunnel
Tracks against Wu rap debut, top article
Spin it again, sign of the time rhyme
Top of the line, bottom of the Pyramids
Stretched in the alphabet, wet dust Moet, poet threat
Evil cassette wreck shows, rip any set
Direct approach coach a emcee, toast a emcee
Don't provoke me, toast to me W-T-C
Fade is still bushy, spot the best pussy
Keep my gears flashin, ready for the action
Fatal rap attraction, mic that rock the cradle
Razor Sharp label, ferryboat
Park Hill Gallo and the Sable
Martin Luther King Islam Rodney King
Two to four work release time in the bing
Big guns lawyers dirty cops naked in the box
Puerto Ricans, Africans, one Ox
Bowl of rice Trump, poor people
Plus meat that tastes lethal, we all not treated equal
The bible, the thirty-six tribal
Trials and tribulations, survival
Drugs as my retardation, masturbation
False identification, one nation
Blood, mud, water, togetherness
Terrorist, peace to all thug, Hennesey in the jug
Box cutter under the rug, that'll cut your whole mug
You bugged, kid, fuck off




I was born on a sunny day, Birds chirping
The doctors putting they work in
I arrived during hard times most certain
Grateful never hateful, I don't have to debate with you
I brought this to get you back in the groove
This one is for the Arabics and the Jews
Listen to my song, Slang Terra-Don
Show em how to be strong, Never stay in the wrong
A doctrine to hold your towel tight
I speak light, Never speak white, I'm from the project
If you don't live there you don't know what it's like
Where I come from these streets don't give a fuck about you
Stay low, Get your own paper, Absorb the elements
Remain calm and intelligent, Come on God, That shit is irrelevant
My mind build escalators inside of your head like television
Hella vision, I could feed you with the street shit
Our niggas get hit with the heat quick, The beef is thick
He got hit with the police sticks, Reach for the splif
Before he went down he peeped on his kicks


We write lyrics (that the streets like)

"Cause yall niggas thinking it's right."


Life's a struggle, To me it's like ohh God
And I'm tryna live in a place we know it's so hard
I reminisce on birthdays and old cars
And tell Momma I love her whenever I go far
I set my kids like, Daddy be back soon
And if it go well then the stacks'll be back soon
Spread love to fam cause your friends won't do it
Gotta go, Stay on your roll, Go out and pursue it
You damn right I wanna see Alvin do it
And sugar-booger-daddy watching you so you better get to it
And realize what we're living for, And the stakes is high
Your young, But we all need cake to get by
So listen up to what your Momma say, But make your own facts
Go and tell your brothers Daddy did a song with Uncle Cap
Rocky and Kim, Lama I love yall
And nothing till the day I die is ever above yall


I done got money with some of the richest niggas
But the feds turn killas into bitch ass niggas
You know, Sit up on the stand, Star witness niggas
Run off at the lips, Sam the Bull ass niggas
It was all good just a week my niggas
I remember the days we clapped heat my niggas
And to think, I even took a bid for niggas
Loaded forty Glock, Half a brick for niggas
First time felon for the clique for niggas
And this the thanks I get, Bullshit my niggas
I did it all, I would've even died for niggas
It hurts my heart, Sometimes I wanna cry my niggas
With these words, We might even spread apart
But this dart, I'm pouring out my motherfucking heart
At the end of the day, I truly love you my nigga
But today, Mega Don, I'm no longer a nigga


Leave me alone, Yall niggas don't know me
I'ma kill yall niggas, I do my dirt upon my lonely
Slim, Skinny, And boney, One with the Stonies
Paid my dues so yall niggas own me
School kicked out for pissing in the staircase
School of hard knocks got caught for selling hard base
Who you think helped them wash their money
They left their man behind enemy lines, All hungry
The winter war was for sure, I live next door
Bullets spit, Hit the bricks, Ricocheted, We laid on the floor
I could've sworn my deal was gonna feed the hood
And me and my baby Mommas was gone be good
Antwon my baby boby, Ason my pride and joy
Coshy Moshy you my Heavens to Merca Troy
Don Kinish, Mr. Brick, I will murk your boy
Cause these starving artists the hardest, I stay unemployed





Fourth quarter time


Clarks is lighty scuffed, need a new pair
Jacob Javits Center, Wu and Snoop there
D-Block pull up, olive green drops
The interior suede, cuz thats boss crock
Air fresheners hang, the joint is sold out
To capacity, this young bitch keep asking me
Can I suck your dick?, Not now, shorty
Maybe after the show, just hold fast for me
Ferocious bangles, birds on both arms
Im jew-eled out like a box of Lucky Charms
On stage, two treadmills, a pull-up bar
Involved with the lights to give it that red feel
Feeling like Bruce Wayne, making up for never making the prom
Ma, you chilling? The belt glow in the dark
Where my aunt stays, batteries gone
Thats when I pull a forty out for Ason


Wu-Block, Im from a gun play habitat
Let me run into Nicki, Im smashing that
What you know about the ratchet in your mother mouth
Killah banging the neck, with two rubbers out


(Man, thats murder, you fuck with Wu-Block, now thats murder)
Shout out to Ason (yeah)
Aiyo, Ghost, Im going in, family (go head, get em)
Feel me, son (yeah)


Sheek and Ghost Deini, aiyo, Cap, pour that bitch a martini
Loosen her up, fuck it, pour Goose in her cup
Tell her chill, cuz the Gods is here
Big money in this place, Im balling when Im leaving out of Chase
Red diamonds on a Freddy Kruger face
I dont get pat down, you know whats on the waist
I dont mean jazz when I say I count base
Fly Louis sneakers, Purple Tape coming out the speakers
Bumped into my high school teachers
They said I wouldnt be nothing, sitting on the bleachers
Now Im sitting in the Phantom, trynna figure out the features
Im a big fish now, I watch for the leeches




Aiyo, I jump on stage with my dick in my hand
Im a Park Hill nigga, straight from Shaolin
New York is the borough where I pump my rocks at
Bitch ass niggas where I dump my Glocks at
I dont have to get dip, Im known and flossy
Im known everywhere like Remedy Rossy
Never say shit, Im hard and cocky
Too hot for these tracks, wash this summer
Go hard for the hood from Allentown to Sumner
Yeah, nigga, what, Im just one of us
For all my jail niggas, that feel wondrous
Fuck a fat bitch, with a thunder butt
Mad groupie love, too caliente
Mahogany, polly with Sin Jay
My nigga Ghost Rider, King Sheek Louch
Im in the fly spotlight with that Papoose






Yeah, nigga!
Aiyo, what up man? This is all BB right here
Word, yo, we just slid in from the back door
It's Code:Red, nigga, level four, ya'll know what it is, man
I told ya'll, huh? I didn't? Watch this one, though (Goon Squad!)


Aiyo, I know niggas that get dusted and wild out
They foul out, talk to the cops and play they style out
Me? I'm real hood, and them niggas that was fakin' before
I take they jaws, cuz Lord, I wish they would
Yes, Lord, it's all good, you know I hustle
In the tanktop with no muscle, all in the hood
And roll dice by the elevator, and post up
And wait there, if he comin' in, dog, gotta wait til later
I squeeze off, ease off from the nine milly
And my niggas be like, "Watch how he whine, Billy!"
And for the record, these niggas gotta come kill me
Where I'm at, in the Hill, by the Ooh, silly
Danger, danger, ain't nothin' change but space
Ask Space and Daxe, in how they manage
And how I do damage, fuck takin' flicks for cameras
You know them bandanas, run with them clip bananas
I'm on the hunt for the big dough to stick Santana
Plus these labels exec's come in a calm manner
N.S.Beezy, I stay easy
Fuck what ya'll niggas is talkin', I'm off the heezy


In the hood, you get fake hugs and cold stares
Heat holdin' niggas with the apple colored wears
Try'nna get them greens, premature niggas get knocked out and dope fiend
Niggas stand up, Staten Island, rip you and ya mans up
Hands up, yeah, kid, it's the real
Rough necks on this side, cats makin' a deal
Coke in the bill, weapons appeal, do what ya feel
From Park Hill to Jungle Nillz
So much that we gotta pay the bills
Give us the cream or get killed....

Goon Squad!


Aiyo, my jewels so chunky, I got a brass monkey
With a, rock in his ear, two chips in his tooth
No cuff', I throw the ol' joint off the roof
It's a new year, I'm layin' new words in the booth
Fuck "The Truth", I'm "The Reason" why rap needs to +change+
The same four quarters in +the game+, I got change
Nickles and dimes, rhymes, styles of Beneen
See, Cash Rules Everything, lord, I need C.R.E.A.M
Gotta team that could elbow out the meat cooler
I'm a hustler, I could sell a brick to a jeweler
Off your front porch, g off ya back deck
This me, Lounge and the team, we dishin' up the projects


We killas as sharp as knives
Work for hire, special key be the paralyzer
Got my own killa slang and dancers
Certain hammers for certain circumstances
These the roads of Allah's deed, knawhatimean?
I took the advances and bulletproofed the Suburbans
No handouts, stay earnin' mine
The hood hate to see a nigga shine and now I know
That a ho gon' always be a ho
And 23's can't fit on a '98 Tahoe
And ain't no superstars comin' off Apollo
The chicks around the way frontin' with tongue rings, don't swallow
My mind was raped as a child, Rocky could of never beat Apollo
The feds could of never caught 'Cino
P. Diddy would of never fell for a bird like J.Lo, power to the peso, nigga!




The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man


Yo, pa, I got a lady, I'm 'bout to make her my baby
Might even make a baby, the thesis makin' her crazy
She know my style wavy, I'm circlin' her Mercedes
Father, father was a preacher, I'm almost certain he hates me
But he ain't gotta date me and look, his baby is grown
And she decides on her own who resides on the throne
I'm her king, she my queen, we keep it right in the zone
And she understands the fact that I'm even right when I'm wrong
When she was prayin' in church, I was playin' in dirt
That's 100, I admit that we both was playin' at first
When opposites attract, I ain't always sayin' it works
I'm just sayin' ain't no use in me strayin', that make it worse
It's Wu-Tang, baby, my crew bang
And she's the preacher's daughter, I just call her my boo thang
And we tighter than shoestrings, or 10 grand in rubber bands
Man, sometimes I tell your parents just don't understand


No. yo, you mean Pastor Brown's daughter?
The preacher, the rich slave-maker of the poorer?
I used to see her Sundays comin' from church
We used to kick it at her window when her pops at work
Yo, her parents didn't play
She couldn't even come out to play on a school day
Thought she was gonna give me some on April Fool's day
(But no, no way) nah, (no, no-no, no-no, no-no way)


The preacher's daughter, she an illegitimate child
She know the word, but she be runnin' in them streets foul
She married to a man, but she's crushin' his brother now
See her in the market place loud and boisterous
With tight spandex on, chokin' her oysters
She a seductress in the form of a goddess
Never virtuous or modest, poison the part is
Breakin' the vessel, turn brother against brother
Man, that's how she molest you
That's why the preacher man prolly a mess too
Cause the fruit that she devourin' is evil
Never sin around righteous people
Black widow, preacher's daughter comin' to eat you


The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man


I met her on the bus stop with black eyes
That's why she said she don't fuck with black guys
I cleaned her up, fed her all my wisdom
Her father spit the gospel but she never caught the vision
Brutal ass whoopins, always facin' these evictions
So she only fuck with thugs that'll wind up in the system
Them greasy bastards quick to squeeze a ratchet
Never knew the science of virtue, Ecclesiastes
Like, a time for peace, a time for war
A time to laugh though, she never felt God before
Eternal love that'll pop like a kernel, this is grown folk talk
Between me and her, it don't concern you


The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man




Yeah

Fuck everybody


Cracks in my pocket

Cant wait till im older
So I can do independent things
Well first ill have money
Then I got bad diet
Thought out high school
Imma fuck up that
Pray that god dont judge me
For all of my wrongs
So I forgive all of yall niggas
And I put it in a song, cmon
If you fucked up the way that I did
Then you more than just a baby
You a project kid
You probably shitted on yourself
And you proud of where you come from
Most niggas in the hood see no good
Why you think people hear shots and they dont run
Stuck with this loaf of bread
A couple stale slices
Eat with tea cause got it wrapped in ice chips
Look at the black guy
He got 30 white chicks
Yeah we fight hard
And we spark purple night sticks
Urkel type witch
With classy ass chicks
That love me for me
Cause I master that bitch
Stuntin african nigga
Yea
It aint nothing for us to get dirty
Always keep a big scrape on our knees since big wheels
Fresh for you
Its hot in the pjs
I think you smell good, you look good, you feel good
 you can make it tryna fake it
Come on man be yourself
I know how you feel
Michael jackson said it starts with the man in the mirror
Michael jackson shit


Sometime it get cold up in my zone man
Two to the head just staring at the microphone
Like yo
I can just see starting to blow
And get some money real quick
Cause everybody making dough
Maybe ill simplify my rhyme a little sumin
I talk a lot of shit
And never say nuttin
Reduce the realness
Ill amplify the front
Make it seem like im dumb as fuck
And I dont know nuttin
Id like that life (i bet you would)
The world train nigga
Glorified kill in the zone
To get some fame nigga
Flav used to live in the house
With the same niggas
Passengers bought in crib
Got them plane tickets
Send his monkey ass on tour
Make sure he say what hes supposed to say
Nuttin more
God forbid these niggas start making sense
God forbid real players got a ball from bench
You dig
Are you sure
Thats who you are
Are you the person
You wanna be
And do you wake up nights and find
You got an unclear conscience
You got an unclear mind]


I was raised on welfare
With no health care
But now Im a man
And I dont need no help yea
Cause now im on the block
Building up my welfare
Cause to me now
The pictures more clear
You dont understand
What it takes to be a man
Cause now I got the world in my hands
So I plan
To get more money in my hand
So motherfuck you if you dont understand
Every woman, every man
We all need a plan
So its my duty to do all that I can
To formulate and stand
But now you want us dead
So cap said run
So I ran, damn


 But when one of your brothers is down
Thats when you supposed to stand up
You know what im sayin
And be strong
And be their clutch
So that.]
Are you sure
Thats who you are
Are you the person
You wanna be
And do you wake up nights and find
You got an unclear conscience
You got an unclear mind]
All them white people
I forgot my shit
Hold up
Blahhhhhblablah




Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to welcome to you
All the way from the slums of Shaolin
Special uninvited guests
Came in through the back door
Ladies and gentlemen, it's them!


Dance with the mantis, note the slim chances
Chant this anthem, swing like Pete Sampras
Taking it straight to Big Man On Campus
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Scandalous, made the metro panic
Cause static with or without the automatic
And while I'm at it, yo, you got cash, pass it
It's drastic, gotta send half to Dirty Bastard


Waves is spinning, blades is spinning
Slay em in the eighth inning
Stay truck, god stay playing linen
Kill rap, observe the uptowns, ho, feel that
Mink jeans on, seen where the real at
2000 Zitos, moving with a ill ego
For real, for real, ill lines, ill people
Yo, bring it back, 9 more civilians
Pollying deals, monopoly and bills, y'all niggas lying
Caught 300, lab look royal wit a mean stomach
Go broke, all seen, done it
Words from the heavy set, if I don't eat, then we already met
Fly ass bro, liver than coke


Now what Clan you know with lines this ill?
Bust shots at Big Ben like we got time to kill
Niggas can't gel or I'm just too high to tell
Put on my gasoline boots and walk through Hell
With 9 generals, 9 ninjas in your video
9 milli blow, semi-auto with no serial
Man metaphysical, I speak for criminals
Who don't pay they bills on time and fuck with digital
Never seen, smoke a bag of evergreen
My sword got a Jones, more heads for the severing
Johnny in the dungeon, taking all bets, throw ya ones in
Scared money don't make money, throw ya guns in


That's word to Damo, San Juan, Puerto Rico
Blowin hydro on a beach wit Tamiko
My gun bullet hollow for you to swallow
Blowin' the nozzle, hear it whistle
One in the head, this is code red, man for dead
X amount of lead spray from the barrel
Heat clear the street like Connor O'Carroll
Fully equipped, rifles, banana clip shit
To make my niggas from East New York flip


Yo, you may catch me in a pair of Polo Skipperys, matching cap
Razor blades in my gums (BOBBY!)
You may catch me in yellow Havana Joe's goose jumper
And my phaser off stun (BOBBY!)
Y'all might just catch me in the park playin' chess, studyin' math
Signin 7 and a sun (BOBBY!)
But you won't catch me without the ratchet, in the joint
Smoked out, dead broke or off point (BOBBY!)


Wallo's comfortable, chocolate frosting
Your socks hangin' out, yours is talkin'
Rock so steadily, son, I'm still crazy
Sport my old Force MD furs from the 80's
Nat Turners wit burners, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Taught y'all niggas how to rap, reimburse me
Rothsdale's, ruby red sales, Bloomingdale's, blocks
Ox tails chopped up in Caribbean spots
I'm nice, maxed out, creepin' wit the ax out
Murder these bikini bitches, switchin with they backs out


Niggas wanna pop shit, I pop clips
Bitch, I'll put my dick on ya lips
Alabama split, hammer slay quick
That David Banner gamma ray shit
Shells in the mouth, jailhouse snitch
My powder voice, Snow White sniff
Verbal killas, gorilla grip
God body shit, puff Marley spliffs


You might see me in a 6, that's not my style
You might see me wit a bitch, that's not my child
I be in the benzo, keep a low profile
Dead serious, take flicks and don't smile
Tryin' to get money, y'all cats is wild
I pose for the clothes, make a song like wild
I'm a chip off the board game, got sword game
Live life to the fullest, still want more fame
Darts on layaway, beats on standby
Outfits pressed up, ready for airtime


Run on the track like Jesse Owens
Broke the record flowin', without any knowin'
That my wordplay run the 400 meter relay
It's on once I grab the baton from the DJ
A athlete wit his iron cleat in the ground
Wireless nigga who sprint off the gun sound
The best time yet still 7.0
Swift flow made the cameramen clothes blow




Uhh, yeah, what, uhh, yeah
Darts of armored warfare, Deep the rhyme Caprice
Deep in levels, alibi havin rebel could play
This competition for pounds in the state of permission
Conversation bout this kid Killa Bamz
You want defense, man to man, location Shaolin New York
It ain't nuthin to talk or walk
Get dark son, economic times to fault
Style is mangohead stagnated from soft
What the fuck you thought, we was given support?
Live from Beatdown, Shaolin success, bypass the rest
Move sixty deep, Dutch with the charm
One hundred, twenty arms, designed to unleash bombs
Holdin dart guns in palms
One hundred divine cyphers, Killa Bamz
I pack the dart gun hate to see another death in the fam
Uhh, yeah, what

Pump up your fist (3X) if you love this shit
Pump up your fist (3X) if you love this shit


Y'all confused and amusing, transfusion I'm bruising
Meth-Tical illusions, salutin my blade
Tongue blade of fury, nurse the wound leary weary
Teary fear me, clearly, the pearl drop
Time stop, holdin shop, shockwave be brave
Ghetto came style is maim out to lunch
Out to crunch munch rhyme foods, my life reflect the jewel
My life control the cruise, ten deadly touches too
Grip the Dutches move, swing rough to cut ya
Is the one to seek philosophy in crutches
You disbelieve, in the T
Truth Equal King Islam Truth Heard Alive, TEKITHA
Bust the cypher on the Gods, bust the cypher on the Gods

Pump up your fist (3X) if you love this shit
Pump up your fist (3X) if you love this shit


Vanglorious darts, brown skinned with the pen
Pioneer shift from the beginning to the end
Whatever I do, y'all imitate -- try to come close
But can't come straight; I branch out
Terrorize scenes, split tracks, split hats
Bare facts, guns, crazy funds, a thousand sons
That'll rain on your gang, you're too plain
My dope is uncut, high level high like a plane
Bigger bite bigger mic underground beneath these streets
W-T-C, leaky leak
Time meet, Chi meet, ain't nuttin sweet
Pakistan, Iran clan is like Christ
Word to Poltergeist, smash every tape
Deep thoughter, out of order, off
Seven thirty, bugged like psycho from the Bronx
Wild like fat pen child to be the rap Lawrence Martin
Eyes like lills, mescaline pills
Three bills worth of darts, pump the heart
Bottom of the chart, slug art closin you in once again
It's the all time great, demonstrate, vocabulary execution
Executive approachin, Tang a demonstration
Pillage Incorporated, first place
A thai clean like a plant, eight time writer champ
Lamp on the beatbreak, camp on verses
Cheat on producers, men go working
Rhymes make a mill-in, born Park Hill'n
Internal lyrics, expose the profane
Vote for Cappadonna and your whole life'll change

Pump up your fist (3X) if you love this shit
Pump up your fist (3X) if you love this shit
Pump up your fist (3X) if you love this shit




Hood Life Nigga (yeah)

Blunt side with Diesel
Always got stink on it
Concrete babies
Pampers dont fit em
Whoever dont belong here

I be in the projects, slums and the alleys
15 silk shirts, Jones and Balleys
125th Street rappin at rallys
But then its silk view so full of knowledge
Young n the restless
Never on the guest list
Scared we going come in the spot
And straight wreck shit
Child support getting paid
Before they accept it
But my pressure going buss
If Im feeling rejected
Rap extremely good
And feel like im breathless
I do it for my family
And thats why im blessed with it
Chicks keep hatin
Cause they see my success with it
Pass it to my man
Cause he never fuckin mess with it


Vibrant lights
Silent moon
Watching over
As we step into the room
Stars applaud
They in support of what we do
It's only gods involved
Feel it when we come through
Thunder in the drum
A bolt of lightning out the tongue
Imma hit the  of every function
We admit, immaculate spread
Hammer suckers submit
And even now the niggas game
Me some shit so righteous
Used to gettin loaded in cyphers
Mads getting  its the survival of crisis
Hold up the format and nobody like this
Wont catch us in your average cyphers
We writers professionally
Came to knock you off your pedestal
All that rap criminal shit
Yall rappers beat aint true
To rhyme like a vehicle
Move to forward tell the industry
Real niggas backin them up


Yo hip hop lingers on
My man Angel Lue
Im still rhyming direct
From the 1s and 2s
Im in the hallway
Im in the doorway
I still keep a skip by the steps
Man, all day
Im a yes man
Fuck best man
Yall know the niggas Im fuckin with
Yes the Klan
Capadon, Raekwon, Chef, Method Man
And I remember the first every Summer Jam

Hip hop frontin


You kill then you shot
Malcolm X in the frame
Damn man
These killas gon murder to the game
Apply heat to beef
Like a burger to the flame
Murder the game
Brah heard you can do the same
Im Hussein on the script
But Im like Lou Kane when I flip
Brains what I hit
You lames gon be sick
Like dysenteriae
4-4 to bury you
The more, the merrier
Lets build a wall
Im daring ya
Rest in Big Pun
You aint killed a monkey
Youre a gorilla
He aint building shade tho
Lettin em chains blow
Sometimes I wear hard
Yeah sometimes I halo
A death sentence
In the form of a union
I suggest 
Cause we normally shooting
Leave your chest 
For more recruiting
Like the label advance
Sink your ship like a naval advance






God body represent this shit without a shotty
That's my word, youknowhatI'msayin
Verbal intercourse, youknowI'msayin


Chorus:
Hot rock slang, reversable talk
Sound check, architect, mega talks yo
Alphabet kings politic quick
We on some real live thug shit


Beatdowns galore, kids walk away holding they jaws
Wishin they had yours, tours posters plus sneaker stores
Balls be gettin licked kid on whatever airline
Restroom style courtesy from stewardess, the bitch washed mine
Shellbox nines never been popped, Knowledge Bill shots
Israelis be hittin me, Ting's death made the store hot
Jewels gleam, niggas beam, whole team labelled wally king
Goldie bought a pair, Chinese man dot him with the green
World's greatest, Las Vegas payed us, rap crusaders
Casino champs, Gods sport the latest
Today's math, fuck nothing but ass, take Cristal baths
Go half on this robbery, we run up on Johnny Cash
Kid's invicible, back to back screws, Wu's suspenseful
You get lynched, Starks will play it cool like a mint
Like a night out, whitey's callin me like a double date
Alkies get the shanks, yo it's swine inside Hostess cakes
Yo my man, check the moral or get deaded
You bust a shot and that big bullet was unleaded
Word up, yeah, bounty killer


Yo I'm elected by a landslide, well known, heaven sent element
That shit you talk's irrelevant, got power like the president
My dialogue's benevolent, no question I'm connected got a
Gift for stick-up and late night coke pick ups
Money talk gets my dick up, especially drug related
Money boss contemplated, Bronx blocks complicated
New York by us so don't try us
Mad corrupted minds for mad corrupted times
Thank God I had rhymes
I be the rapper who be hustlin, black entrepreneur
Openin doors for the poor though it's against the law
Livin the climate for a killin, smack the law and fuck your order
Some others watch your daughters, it's a slaughter
In the world of scramblers and gamblers, dicks and dykes
Long cars and caviar, you know the project stars
I give a penny for your thoughts, pay a nickle for tush
So stop beatin round the bush and give it to me
The way you look is goin through me
Sue me, takin everything I got and
Plottin animosity for my property
Got me and locked me away from the world
I'm wonderin who's puttin use to my money and my girl


Chorus (2x)


Check it, yo
Thoughts collaborate with gun talk, shatter weak force
My strategy, stalk for casualities walk
They tragically caught a cavity in they anatomy
Assault and battery for havin me
Believin that they bad, in actuality they cavalry's butter soft
Niggas runnin off with the gun and talk
Loose lips, slip the fucker two clips to shut him off (blaow)
So sweet dreams to your weak team, my heat feeds ya ass to rest
See who pass the test of guns that blast the best
You never win against Killa Sin, you're similar to Gilligan
We're fillin his ass, not worth the mentionin
Like snatchin pocketbooks and claimin bodies that you didn't catch
Aimin empty Glocks at niggas' necks without intent to wet
You just a wannabe, gonna be dead nigga
In front of me with no abundancy amongst your currency
Flat broke, sellin lady powder maybe even flour
Last thing I heard a fiend that flips over a baby shower


Yo I remember gettin ganked, staggerin on the plank
Dwellin on the edge, full fledged, grabbin for bank
Auto pounds touchin clowns, DT's clock rounds
For slick was in the SL, forty shells hit the ground
55 on the Belt, fifty grand in my belt
Then I swerve to New Jers, that's where Iceberg melt
It was a ruthless type of homicide, this is the drama side
Porcelin nine milli slugs tear up your insides
Venomous vocabulary, mad niggas heard it
Got annointed like the Juice, two minutes before the verdict
Who make a claim, who movin caine on trains
Slick lines is open, out of state kids give me the lane
Def flip the track, cut the rhyme like quanines
Stampin undertaker, the slums is mine nigga


Chorus (2x)


Real Live up in this piece, the remix
Word up, Wu-Gambino representin
Tony Starks, yeah yeah
Cappadon doin his thing
Killa Sin, hit em, hit em kid
Yeah, Lord Tariq, you nice duke
Uh, K-Def, knowImean, keep bustin em dunn



Gyg




Fuck ya'll niggas is talkin' bout? (clack clack-cla-clack clack)
Crunchy chump motherfuckas, ya'll niggas is all pussy
That's my word, ya'll know how the realest niggas is
Don't let me tell ya'll again, bitch, straight up
I put all this right there, on niggas in H.T.M.'s son
Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo


All magazines lit, fly life we live
The lingo is to let, ya'll niggas know, how niggas rep
I'm set, lightin' the purple in a new jet
Triflin' work, let's murder everything that move on the set


Goin' back to basics, shit you catch case with
Style laced with, arsonic, before you taste it
Rap matrix, gemini's is two faced it, I heard Rob Based it
"Bad boys" retire out the game just like Mase did
Dish it out and take it
To where I'm bout to go and everybody ain't gon' make it


Blow shipments out the rap shit, clap shit
Most of us attack shit, mean Benz, ballin' wit the bad chick
Take over, quick fast, violate, slap shit
And every borough, state, town, prison, map shit
Makeover hoes that blow, they attract dick
Shine on my jims, glow, on the low, slap dick
To every mean queen clean, keep it black chick
My motto, CREAM, green bottle of the phat shit




"Brothers respect mine!" - Raekwon
(Uh, uh, what, for real nigga, step the fuck off?)


Aiyo, Ice Cream, real niggas in whips
Fur coats, Gucci boots and shit, fly honey dip
Streets and clips is what we live for, rub on the floor
Ox in the jaw, rockin' the four, rugged and raw
Righteous and more, we the gliders, the outsiders
Killa Bee hivers, the big boy drivers
The conivers, the four fivers, survivors
We the livest and carry the heaters, coke is in the meters
Six to eight seaters, circle the mind readers
Pumas, Nikes, and Adidas, hip hop achievers
Love hood rats and love divas, love money, love sex
Love vets, love weed and love wrecks


All in together now, follow me the Method
Raw individual, the enemy you slept with
No love here, no tender, love and care
But M.C.'s, I'm starvin', niggas best before
For consumption, for wack assumption
You can catch a bad one or somethin'
From shotgun, you know I'm pza-pza-pumpin'
Jumpin', thumpin', get crunk and
Drunk inside the function
+Uncontrolled+ with the +Substance+
+Beneath the Surface+ there's +Redemption+
For Bobby Digital +Supreme Clientele+ convention, +Nigga Please+
+Immobilarity+ they can't breath til they +Blackout!+
I used to write and smoke L's in the crackhouse
Pull your wig like a potato then I mash out
Check your ego at the door
Better wipe your feet before you step me, or it's yourz!





If it's possible I'll step in your obstacles


Oh shit you better watch out for this
Revenge so sweet that you might wanna flip
Ride on your enemies, bust they shit
Throw away the pistols throw away the clips


Big grits, big ox snatch ice at Woodstock
Remember those kids that hold cries they runnin fast
Crack spillin out they sides
It's the Hill brothers that kill
And raps on a blue trap water bugs nothin but thugs
Cops circlin, two cuts on shorty mugged
Streets turn by the flyest of bug
It's switch the e-shit fucker
I take rhymes like a piss
Eat the beats like tuna fish
Stay focussed, your camp is dead meat and drop worms
Wu-Tang is up on it too big to back down
Defeat never heard of I came with the crowd merger
The super friends seek that revenge
Bout to fuck out, you kiss girls on the mouth
Over here all of my niggas is bout bout




Call me straight up oak y'all niggas just plain panel
Guns from my Ceridoor ask mic ammo
Cross fire, bullets racashe horizontal
Brooklyn bridge pharazano niggas know the motto
Follow the path, knowledge the craft
Swallow a whole bottle of math
Since biology class
Grand achery, bow and arrow split your grand largely
Afro in ya heads, robin hoods drop goods in these wild lands
A desert eagle in a child's hands
Your style's planned, my styles blend earth, wind, fire, water
You never know my son might fuck Mariah's daughter
Ill visions of victory without a battle
Breathes through tracks like cold winds towards Seattle
Sound travels through fiber optics under gravel
Combinating six sixty and they try to handle
Niggas try to handle




Yo we always had a eight on us
Cold hands slingin niggas gotta pay on us
Co-froze our whole shit so you can skate on us
Niggas don't freeze long, start to rain on us
I'm the type tah hold the mac with one hand
Squeez that shit till the gun jam
Flow sickly rhyme swettin I'm too ill
Get blown quickly for two mills
Ice pick ain't too real sing your nice six swing to kill
Who runnin with the kid that brang me the pill?
Who runnin with the kid I'm like stainless steel
Frail nigga on some high and might, break your grill
Showtime there's a joke time I poll on the box
Poke lots of little holes in you like four little dots
Become my doja and baloon swallow them rocks
Shit out my profit hole by tommorrow you drop




There's a place out there where the enemies lurk
In the woods try to burn down mamma's church
No love, they came to spread hate
The angels floried inside the pearl gates
The world got dark, a earthquake
Trembled the underneath of the feet of pedestrians
Rain, drops fire and snowflakes
Destroy homes that contain the mad evil
All of God's children ran towards the ???
For all of those who did wrong to the ???
Their souls were cast out into the deep
Bodies of the unholy covered the street
And all of God's creatures ate them like meat
Oh father have mercy on the weak
The ones that can't see and the ones that can't speak
The ones in the projects smokin that leaf
Who lived through slavery, families got beat
Bit by the dogs, shot by the police
Screaming for justice, screaming for peace
Brothers behind bars fighting with the beast
Third world countries plus the Mid East
We all gon die if the battles don't cease

 X4




Homicide Hill, S.I., New York City
Slow your roll, it's my word
Slap all ya niggas, I hate ya'll
Aiyo, aiyo


These streets got the best of me, my lifestyle's corrupt
It's jakes lookin' for Don, and I don't give a fuck
Cuz my niggas be on the block, ready to rock
We got big bags of ready on us, one Glock
Feds makin' it hot, so I dipped off
I smoke the ill idiot shit like Malakoff
Me and my thug niggas, too chipped off
Staten Island be the land of the lost
You can't front, you can't floss
S.I. New York City, the burnt out apartments, the hallways that's gritty
It's a pity we livin' this shit, cracks under my dick
Feel my pain, if you know about this shit
Dope in the toilet, money in the mattress
We keep ratchets, and like niggas up north, we fuck a fat bitch
We eat octopus too, and we love the catfish


The building of the most powerful dynasty
We not just any stars, whether you be a murderer
Or maybe the world just never heard of you
Go 'head and play it out, this the role of ya lifetime


Shoot 'em up shit, nigga, shoot 'em up shit, nigga
(Yeah bitch), yeah all up in your voicebox nigga


Yo, all ya'll bitch ass muthafuckas, ya'll ain't shit
You actin' like you can't happen til I pop the clip
Have your girl suckin' my dick, run in your crib and take chips
You don't know me, I don't fuck around with ya'll, homie
You can't hold me, fake ass niggas owe me
Big Don from the group home
Sittin' on the front stoop smokin' a bone
All ya'll hatin' ass niggas, get one in your dome
Or I'm up in the studio, playin' the phone
I put hits on your fam, dog, now you alone
So why you just not popular yet, I grab my tech
And run around the blocks and demand respect
It's the who? Nigga, Jay Bird, that's my word
I leave your body in the dollar van, your brains on the curb
Staten Island niggas be the most superb
Laid back in the joint, just be smokin' the herb








Huh, after all these years, what you said was true
The Shaolin and the Wu-Tang is very dangerous

Hahahahahah


It's the ODB kid, once again coming through your area
And I'm going to tell you one time, you gon' love this


I had to get the money, said it wasn't a choice
Die Hard's on the bars, Ladies lovin' the voice
Morphine flow, numbing your joints
Bomb a nigga like he number 81 from Detroit
Zombie life, World War Z
Antidote to your virus, your highness, the world on me
Capital G, cool as the dude from Dos Equis
So deadly, I don't make it rain, I snow heavy
Sick lane, Nic Cage how I ride with fire
Forever with bars, sort of like a lifer
With the son of anarchy, I be breaking bad
Walking dead, day dreaming of making a band
Dancing with the stars, Americans idol me
The mentalist with the Big Bang Theory


Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


The most duplicated, anticipated, validated
Urban legends in the books with the ones who made it
Highly celebrated, everything was work related
Current top 40 got the Wu deep in all their business
20 years Killa Bees, yeah, we hold the pennant
Monumental stance on the cover with my co-defendants
Drop her sentence, in remembrance
Construct these jewels so they can live through my descendants


Youngun, I can see your draws, pull your pants up
Can't even call yourself a man until you man up
And if you call yourself a fan you need to stand up
This ain't a party, it's a jux, keep your hands up
And I don't care who runs the city when the summer come
Your summer's done, Wu forever, and we're still number one


Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


Picture a nigga on the strip getting rich off the drug shit
Putting other niggas on, teaching em thug shit
Then they want stick 'em up, then they get slugs quick
Hood-type niggas always living that crime life
Jealous-ass grimy niggas seeing the limelight
Slimy old nigga like fucking your mans wife
Fool shouldn't use the word brother, he man dyke


Yo, I spin my web all across New York
Get it out in all types of ice, there's a sport
One chain, two chain, three chain, four
Niggas mouth's drop like the leaves in the fall
Tone got that WBC
I take off heavy in air balloons and land in the Fiji's
That's my bird and that's my word
You faggots keep fucking around and get curbed
(I came to town)


Forms circles like the rings of Saturn
Dust rocks and ice in a particular pattern
Then this fascinating picture has emerged from surface
A wonder of the young world with an urgent purpose
A wild fire engulfing every home
It's history chiseled and carved in every stone
A workshop where skills are learned
Handcrafted and drafted, written works the main concern
Urban center provided with a social structure
And a curious culture full of superconductors
Each stain is part of a scene with
Intricate geometric raps on a larger screen
Spell bounding, marvelous and it's surrounding
Viewpoints remain the same, it's all astounding
A place where the forgotten art is so powerful
A striking image is something that's so valuable


This one's the blackout! Three-fifty-seven to your mouth!


GZA, this is called Ruckus In B Minor
Rae, all those bad times is behind us
Ghost, put that mask on to remind us
Method Man, let 'em know who's New York's finest


Youngun, I can see your draws, pull your pants up
Can't even call yourself a man until you man up
And if you call yourself a fan you need to stand up
This ain't a party, it's a jux, keep your hands up
And I don't care who runs the city when the summer come
Your summer's done, Wu forever, and we're still number one


Still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


Now I'mma let all you motherfuckers know
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga
I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker!


My lines is like Peruvian coke, go ahead and try one
My recipe is A1 remarkable with my mixture
Rainman mathematician, this city slicker
The finest threads cover my frame, the cloths of royalty
Strive with an army of winners and no pretenders
(*One*) We live free and achieve more
But first we gotta win with no stalemate
The all eye seeing is victorious biz to the sound man


Armored trucks, tanks are bulletproof, been the truth
Loot the track, clear the booth, my thought ready, aim, shoot
My knowledge one twenty proof, let's tear the roof off
Let's spray, M-A-S-T-A
King I Love-Love club, pack stadium rock
I hold the mic snug, split a slug
Black ninja, mask and gloves


Still number one, still number one




"Where you going? Aren't you scared we'll get you?"
"Look for me all you want - you're not gonna find me though."


Crack backs heavy on the cash all night
At the drug site we hung tight
Three o'clock in the night ounces of blow dirty kicks
Money gets low in the street yo
Tough times nickles that's bigger than dimes
You know the flavor
Roughneck city; ain't nuttin sweet kid ain't nothin pretty
New York be poppin the cork on crime look at the nine
Summertime in the courthouse, aw shit it wasn't mine
Two to four, three to nine, Benetton'd it what
We all ran, fuck grams, you outta luck
Young bucks carrying gats, stay strapped for what
We all safe from the po-lig, nobody bust
FREEZE! We in the breeze with the blunts
Nobody drop the trees or they fronts
Meet up on the roof, look off the front, play low
Watch out for po'-po', that's how it go, three in the whip
We not that legit though, run for the gusto
Peep Marcel and Brown comin around dippin the logo
RUN if you ever got somethin on you son
You best to run, be off the set
Jet, bounce from the projects, season of the vick
Weed in your piss and parole gots ta have it
Slide like a rabbit move quick this is it
Hang jump from the fire escape, I made it
Drop the clip fingerprints all on it
Aw fuck those bullets, I'm losin my pants
I advance my speed, succeed in my travel
Dance on 'em, in a fucked up whip
Make my heart skip, caught up in the drug traffic
I absconded, surrounded by the outfit
120th tried to knock my whole clique
RUN~! These black boys that take none
Don't cop out to shit, take the three to six
And you add that shit - RUN
If you ever pack a nice sized gun - RUN
If you sell drugs to your dunn  - RUN
Be the fuck out! Word to God, run hard


Between two cars we park, pepper got sparked
In the dark heads scramble at the six-ooh
Spies lookin at you one two oh lookin too
How you roll what you stole let me see you go nah fuck you
If you wasn't a cop I might bust you, I don't trust you
Coppers lust over my crew, forget a curfew
We gather in the plaza to jerk through
360 with the crime wave, modern day slave
Reversal on appeal, it's not real, plant that
As a matter of fact we crackin down, us against brown
Run fast like you ran track
Never look back push the Ac' on the sidewalk
Crash, toss the heat and tear ass
Zig zag 'til you reach your stash - RUN
If you sell drugs to your dunn - RUN
Be the fuck out! Word to God, run hard

Me and the God back to back one eight-five with the four-five
Survive that shit, you took case, even though I remember your face
Even though we seen you rollin near Bowling and Greene kid
This cream'll get you robbed, knocked if you don't run
Don't grab my jacket dunn, get the fuck off, break North or go to jail
Word life is trife, on the block it's too hot
You got my man shot nigga RUN
We whylin on Staten Island, it's one thing bein in the bing
And not smilin on the gate, it's too late
Fate held you over, Jakes runnin for snakes
The white rover with the plates burn down Gee street
Comin from outta state, see me in the driver's seat
Coolin without the ID, it's not me
That belongs to the god, D-I-V-I-N-E; RUN
If you sell drugs to they dunn- RUN
If you ever pack a nice sized gun - RUN
If you wanna still have fun - RUN
Be the fuck out! Word to God, run hard... motherfucker


Run motherfucker, run




Niggas are lovers, Are lovers, Are lovers
Niggas loved to hear Malcolm X
But they didn't love Malcolm
Niggas love everything but themselves
But I'm a lover too, Yep, I'm a lover too
I love niggas, I love niggas, I love niggas
Because niggas are me, And I should only love that which is me
I love to see niggas go through changes
Love to see niggas act
Love to see niggas make them plays and shoot the shit
But there is one thing about niggas I do not love
Niggas are scared of loving themselves


Let's go, Yeah, That's what I'm talking about
Everybody put your blunt in the air like this
Yeah, Uhh huh, Uhh huh, Yeah New York in the building
Throw it up for all my dogs in there
Murderland in the building, Let's go, Come on


I emerge from the womb then I snatch the globe
Throw darts for a living, Never sold my soul
These rhymes that I'm making is the top of the line
I seek knowledge, Study the ways of mankind
I scope clubs out see what a savage's like
Then I come back, I'm living in a savage life
To animals my words be the words of Christ
The unordinary life, Sensational with it
In the hood with yall for real you know how I did it
Drop bread on your bird head, Illegal wips
Eat four legged beast, Take illegal trips
And I can't quit now son you must be silly
I ain't stunt'n on hoes but they wet my willy
Yeah, Creep with me my nigga
Tie your joint on, For real conceal your face an all that


You wanna see what a savage like
But we're living in a savage life
They just wanna stomp your life
Niggas wanna stomp your eyes


Yo, I live a life on the street like stray dogs and mutts
Nigga's face filled up with stitches and cuts
But I love my hood though even the crack head's fiend
We doing a bid here, My projects is mean
Black Buddha shop or a big fat Doreen
Twenty-six mob'n, Black fist tossing the green
Heard my nigga L came deep in the feds
Keep the Mazda tight, Hold your heads
Solomon Childs my dun-breed, Love spread through my hood-ohh
Twelve for the pound kid, Three for the id-ohl
Pop the trunk of the Pinto, He been slow
Came back with the hid-i-dro
Snatch pocket books, Hustle for dough
Big Don from Dirty Island
Scrape you off the ground something violent
Don't even dream of Don being in the mainstream
Go savage in the hood for CREAM




We got the hustle game on lock, Let's go get dough
In the ghetto it's mad blow and crime going on
We don't mow lawns, Might take it nice
Where I come from be the slums of Shaolin
Mothers are crying, Young brothers dying
Some of yall people relying on religion
I'm in the hood like a pigeon, Christ has risen
I sold drugs for a living, I was locked down for Thanksgiving
Times are still hard, Dogs in the junkyard
Alcoholics, Butchers, Crack heads, Fuck TNT, Fuck the feds
I'd rather die with my gat, Fucking a bitch and getting high
Far all the times that I couldn't cry
All I wanted was a picture of me lounging in the Vibe
Two cribs, Two chicks, Big brick on my side
A nigga get savage when he gotta survive






Whateva, whateva man
I'm here to represent G-O-D to the fullest
I got a message man, and the message is straighten up
Or get eatin up


All mighty God is with us (2X)


Save the children, these streets is like a villain
Life is like a chop shop inside of the buildin
Save the children, these streets is like a villain
Save the children, let the blood stop spillin


Roses are red, violets are blue, this life is about me and you
Not the red, white and the untrue, together we stand
Divided we stand tall, final call, God save us all from the gates of Hell
Where my young family dwell, it was a tall well
While we still suffer, days are gettin tougher
Jake on the prowl, treatin people on the street foul
Some of them mean well, but they all live behind the shell
Kick my door down, without ringin my bell
Claim I'm sellin crack, but I ain't doin that
All I do is rap, I'm a real MC, trynna get my life back
Devils'll make it difficult, there it glow within the cult
Can't wait to cut my throat, cuz of how I speak
Too black for Hot 97, last year they put me on hold
But I still went gold, where the joy go?
What happened to the +Black Boy+ video?
Bring +Run+ back, y'all scared of Cap
Sleepwalkers can't roll wit the blacks




See the man dem him, he went from nice to true drunko
Now me speak the truth and a man just a den dead
Wit the children, when I told you I be on the outside
I can't trust with him, not pity on the outside
I'm hung it with him, tell him that I carry
Tell dem save the children
You sold your bread, I sold my bread
So ya meet my new friend, Mr. Up-On-The-Ten
Then are ready to bust, let me load again
And the play gon sting, just like stealth bomber
Refuel the jet, because me loose me venom
Jewels we do, and refuse not to sin
And when I come hotter, don't work for Jah
Hittin though we gettin, well that's the word is dark
Brother gettin children, some lovin the hard




A mighty God is with us


Intelligent minds, encounters of the third kind
Trapped behind enemy lines, youth life on the line
Devils keepin us blind if it wasn't for Divine
Contracts wouldn't be signed, save the children
It's like a chop shop inside the buildin
No second guessin, I'm confessin
In the club females are undressin
Little ones with the sexual affection need correction too
For too many years, shippin us upstate
Plantin drugs on us, the children ain't safe
Broke down our families, then they build gates
Sow holes in our brain like life is an earthquake
Stole our language so we couldn't meditate
Even in the schools where the teachers taught hate
Falsify history, everythin is fake
Use your third eye when you dealin with snakes
Let freedom ring, Born Love Allah, see the king
Save the children is the song I sing
While I'm layin in the struggle absorbin the sun rays
Holdin the children in the last days
We're livin like slaves, modern day style
Save the children, make em cry for me now
Save the children, make em cry for me now


Cry for me now, no sight killin
Yagga yaw, them try kill me now
Yagga yaw, dem cry for me now
Save the children, Dem cry for me now
Ya all pigs, you nah
You ya, yea yea, God is with us
Bad man nah know, cry for me now, blaow!


Yo, man, I ain't got nothin to say to ya niggas, man
Word up, just get the album or get the fuck lost
(Be like, fuck it I'm done)
Yeah, (God bless, good night)




Season of Da' Vick...


Aiyo, Tim and 'em, yeah Tim from Down South

So yo, stop all the ego trippin'
Tim put the clip inside the automatic, four-fifth it
The analog rapper start riftin'
Tim maneuvered up closer like Scott Pippen
Look at the analog rappers eyes, water start drippin'
Two cherry head niggas on the side bitchin'
Three chicks walked across the street switchin'
You heard the crank of a car key in the ignition
Don' came around the block with the deep dish in
This kid ran right in front of my whip, I stop dippin'
Runnin' fast like in a flick, he start slippin'
I ducked down slowly cuz I heard shorts rippin' (bong bong)
Big Tim and 'em from Down South was flippin'


Yo, yo, what the fuck is goin' on?
Season of Da' Vick, season of Da' Vick...

Bump this shit in ya chromed out vehicular
Me and my force, we gettin' nothin' but redicular
Fuck Beans, none of ya'll niggas can get with us

Lounge Lo, respect the Lo, respect the bang
See me in the street with the heat, respect my pain
Park Hill cats in the back, respect my gang
And I was brought up to, respect my elders
Respect Miss Martha and respect Miss Felder
A little kid, Mr. Big, respect the gig
Respect my moms and respect my kids
Cuz if you don't, then I got to disrespect ya crib
And have me doin' hect', come and tech ya wig
Now when I touchdown and bust down that dutch to smoke
'Cross the street in the two-seat with platinum spokes
Bandana on my wrists, but I ain't claimin' no set
Got mad sets to lay without goin' for broke
I bust the heat, travel on the bust when I creep
Cop that yae shit and come down, I'm back on the street
Feelin' the vibe, fuckin' with Lounge, I'll kill for five
And if you'se a bad boy, I'm killin' ya pride
Two in the five, push like eight in ya side
Stuff ya body in the truck and take ya ass for a ride, nigga


Yo, yo, fuck is goin' on?
Season of Da' Vick, season of Da' Vick...
Season of Da' Vick, season of Da' Vick...
Yeah, muthafucka...

This is only my sophmore project, man
But I still feel like a freshman
You know, so I got anger
I'm comin in, I'm comin in like one of the new jacks
Just comin in Elmira, wit the D-suit on and whatever
All wrinkled up, niggas throwin piss down
From the eight galleries or whatever
You know, but that's me right there
So what, I'm just comin to represent




"I've seen 357s
I've seen 12-gauge shotguns
I've seen 12-gauge, um, pumps, eight-shooters
I've seen um, .45, um, military special with clip on the street
I've seen hand grenades
I've seen beer-can bazookas made
Damn things hit you, it's just as getting hit with a gun"



I spit it like eight AKs
Murder verse spray first
Birds circle when they say they names

Announce 'em dead, count the heads
Write raps with an ounce of lead
Hid all the master bread
Making sure the hounds are fed
I'm the pterodactyl striking fear in so many

 I'm the ace of kings, toasts up
 Raise your Henny now


Salute to the finest
You in the company of royalty
Sir I, your highness
I can tell you about stackin' a grip
Out in Paris with the baddest bitch
Sittin' at a fashion event
Went from street life to neon lights
Don P on ice

 Fee's tight
Never free on mics
 Got third-world niggas screaming "Deck's the truth"
 And they co-sign E-S when he steps in to bless the booth
 I-N-S never rest, see true
 Czarface
 For the head we shoot
Wuuuuu


I've seen all this
You'd be surprised man
Pretty soon they're gonna steal the damn atom bomb



(Esoteric) Indiana Jones, fuck these snakes to tame
It's like the NBA, too many fakes in the game
Now why is that Deck?


The cake's to blame
In the end I would play it the same
To be for real that's the day it changed
They hate it from the day I came

(Esoteric)
So lame, Jealous One's Envy then they fold like paper planes
I aim and deliver to their, brain and their liver
And I bang out that literature, ain't no one sicker than I
Or us, we're fly we're wise you ride the bus
We're diamonds in the rough, industry we don't trust
We rally troops, rock mics and get loose


And for ya'll didn't bless the youth

(Esoteric)
That's the truth


Cap...


Cappadonna mind twist flows and mega-charm
Hong Kong style that'll break ya man's arm
I'm good with this mic, that's word is bond
You a sucka MC, I'm gonna have to sound this alarm
Punks lust over my queen and it's hard to get it
Yo you snitched on Don, told the world I did it
Yeah your arms is too short to box with God
Compared to the king you just another retard
My style come in threes like tic-tac-toe
And every time you see me I'm gettin' that dough
And I know a hundred rappers that want to be like me
I hate all y'all niggas so I sent my wifey
It's the angel of rap, yeah straight from heaven
I fly cherry-head niggas like 9-11
If I don't bust you, yeah nigga my man's gonna touch you
What you gonna do with a Don like this?


Islam righteous, the god on his deem
Move d motherfucker d Radio Raheem
Idi Amin, I kill needy for the cream
See I'm pristine, needy for the team
The most powerful piece in chess is the queen
The most powerful peace in death is the dream
I don't want to say that I'm the best but I'm king
I don't want to leave a fucking mess at the scene
Put holes in your body like the flesh of a fiend
Gold Maserati and my neck full of gleam
The first half ill and the rest is obscene
A herb stand still when I'm vexed when I'm mean
My mom's crib stocked with the best gudagine
The four-fifth cocked, it's a Glock with a beam
Upper echelon rhyme, rock to a fiend
Cut your fuckin' spine on the dime, nahmean
Stupid! Hahahahaha

Yeah, Boxcutter Pazi, yeah
Czarface
Philly to Boston
Then back down to New York
Staten Island, Beantown, South Philly
Rebel I, Esoteric, 7L, Paziena
Fuckin' cherry-head rapper

Yeah...
Boxcutter Pazi!


"I've seen .22 zip guns, I've seen .38 zip guns
I've seen, I'll tell you things about things you think you'd never see on the street
I've seen dynamite on the street"

Aiyo, I went uptown in the middle of May
I seen a young lady, she was coming my way
I tipped my hat, I said "How do you do?
You looking mighty good in that white and blue"
She said "Damn, Cap, you looking good yourself
I wouldn't wanna be with nobody else"
She had a, nice smile, pretty complexion
But all she needed was a little affection
So I grabbed her hand and said "come home with me
We could go to my house, and watch some TV"
But when we got to my house, we slouched on the couch
Next thing you know, I had my tongue in her mouth
Hold up, hold up, hold up... hold up, hold up...
Now... now... hold up...
We had sex, right, all due respect
She sent me to the store to buy some Kotex
Hold up... I said, "Hey, baby girl, what would you have?
Stay Fresh and Freee or just Maxi Pads"
Get 'em...

When I'm locked down I use Timbs as my shower slippers
I'm in the background mingling with the powder flippers
In the basement, hard-body power lifters
I crush sour in the sifter, see how I lift her
Universal God I stay scientific
The kid with the Golden Arms, Iron Fisted
Stay Asiatic, so cinematic
Noise in the attic, bang out with them automatics
It's hood politics that bring the hunger back
I'm straight chopping wood, call me the lumberjack
Check the catalog put out a hundred packs
Watch for drug sniffing dogs they coming from the back
I'm straight thunder clap the funky drummer's back
It's pure Dopium, give em a heart attack
I stay stacking plaques like ancient artifacts
Joe Namath in the game I'm the quarterback


Eight balls of coke, blunt to the greenery
Pounds in the trunk get you a concrete scenery
Handmade ox'll get you dumped in the mess hall
Snitch niggas run to C.O.s to confess all
This is street knowledge, knowledge I school college
Like a speech from the GZA, sharp like the RZA
Don't run with a scissor, nigga the truth is the
Truth, now I'mma drop a few jewels in the booth
Used to boot crack, stuff em inside a tennis ball
Ans throw it when they rushing the block, trust no cops
Driving around with two mitts in my socks
Cooked coke gon' get you in more trouble than money
Don't crawl through dust juice the pigs is hungry
You think they ain't watching
They watching while you uptown copping
Back home while you're cooking and chopping
They scheming on the block waiting to get it popping


He had a sword and an axe with cuts
Under a road that was woven from silver and gold, waxed it up
His army was so great in quantity
His crops and livestock boost the economy
Many would travel by boat to see him
His image adorned most schools and coliseums
A merchant, hustle those silk and velvets
Portrait illuminated when the torch was well-lit
Picture so beautifully painted that
One thought it would breathe or move cause it would leave a mood
Or energy, you see his wife practiced Yoga
Made herbal enhancers that had saved the soldiers
Guard the treasures in the chambers, halls and vaults
Well-prepared for all assaults
Heavy guarded village
Armed with the sharpest weapons designed to pierce and cause blood spillage


From a young teen, a murder team, inspired by crime
See Allah Just granted permission for my position
Sit down, write rhymes, escaping this repetitive cycle
Slinging dimes, losing time, doing hard time
Teaching y'all mathematically, come see
The epitomy of what you wanna be - emcee
My semi-auto gun mandatory at the sound clash
The mic touched, dance mashed up, pounds of the best
Green glass bottles of don, I sip the liquor slow
Flow so devastating when I go solo
Even when I'm dolo, pretty gun I'm holding
Head swollen off the solid gold soul
Iron Mic pole beat your face like you stole something, trust me
Living life royalty, all wise and healthy
Welcome to the best of me, from knowledge to infinity
Never stopping my projectory, I'm galactic


Yo, peace to all of the gods and all of the earths
We been building like this ever since the first day of birth
The more I start to build, the better I feel
Keep ignorant niggas from me, use dummies for shield
You're not Godbody son, you're just garbage and real snotty
Cherry head gaylord still stuck in the lobby
This the first Now Born, son I'm blessed with mad lessons
Conquered crazy devils, my mind is a weapon
You can't fast with me and avoid the swine
You degenerate emcee, I'm the best of mankind
Allahu Akbar straight jewels and real stars
I'm down with the RZA, got help for the Widow's Son
Pop off on you, you ain't nothing to me - DUN DUN
Original Tyzeem, Holy water, Visine
Designated wordplay, God respect my deen
Shine on little stars and respect the Queen


New York Giant, call me Deck Umenyiora
Fresh with the water connect, two and a quarter
Deal with the dealer, don't trust the transporter
My job is done once I get it to the border
Perico, coke game is kilos of cocaine
Hypodermic needle to the groove, I dose veins
Overdoser, you know the product is raw right
Lines take you there like I wrote it with off-white
Got him bent up, hands looking like a tin cup
Sorry no consignment, get your ends up
Move from the gate now, he on his way straight to Jake now
I'm on the hush with my weight loud
Got the shakes now, how they want it bad
Five or six heads chipping in for a bag
I got the works like a burger deluxe
Get your fix while I'm serving it up, word to us




- Well now, you always seemed so brave before what happened to you, eh?
- You lousy bastards, you smashed our homes and you killed 28 of our family
- Eh huh, huh, huh ha, ha, ha!!!


Thats how I be likin my mic
You gotta know how to adjust that shit


I came to the fork in the road and went straight
Right out the crack vial to the Golden Gate
See the silver spoon in my mouth, it had cake
My rap birth date, debut song was ice bait
Read it like a novel, Donna Cappa Goines
Striving my duns need dollars and coins
Whether in New York or Compton Californs
I come correct, twenty two outfits and a mic check
One derby, Cappachino the great
Sitting at the table where the Gambinos ate

- Lets have a bit of fun then eh
- Right
- Hold it
- What, you want a piece of this too?
- Were professionals. Weve killed a lot of people as a means of getting money. But this time weve killed for a small dowry almost nothing. We killed this young fellow almost for fun. He was hardly a man even. Just a young kid and now then you want to rape a girl?
- We do what we want here killing or raping, right



Thats how I be likin my mic

To send him, I hit 'em when I'mma getter
The fat rhyme spitter, heavy with the flow

Caught up in the ponder rosa, chrome toaster
Five broker, face poker
African rice, fish head, a little ocra

Honor Management, live your dream
Somebody got to go - get that steam
Clear the block off, run fast, hold your bean
Raw scene, our life's like a movie screen
Rated R, hood superstars, great green in jars
The streets is ours, we beating the odds
Roll out, heat in da cars, from deep in the garage
Put beef in the broadz, put skeet in they bras
Me and my man, yo, we just cheating the laws






Nothing like a home cooked meal
Yes my word is my bond
Feels so good to be back in the hood
Its a place that I can never forget


Everything dip in my heart
My brains is numb
Computers taking over
They controlling the young
Out here grinding
Hard like it never even profit
Still theyre not stoppin me
Im doing the monopoly
Yeah I move privately
Stacking for my Cs
Never sloppily, yeah
I hope theyre not watching me
Familiar faces
Fandom or fortune
Travelling more often
Hating ass, grab ass niggas
Want me to fall off the wall
Take one, put me in a coffin
Six million dollar man, steven austin
Yeah nigaa tell your story walkin
Before I put two in your foreskin
Backin atown now im in low in the 
Switched my gear round
Now im back in new york again
State recording, only stay for a short rate
Speeding through the  mistakes yeah
Im going in so I can stop all of the aches
Stress and related injuries
Its hard for me to fuck with you
Fast track seeing young rappers
Using bars moves to attacks
Babes that drunk similac
A lotta shit
I cant remember that
All young with the gold fronts
Selling it for munchies
Yes niggas is thirsty
Yeah is  wid da blunt
Yeah its power in the punch
Yeah its sour in the cunt
Sex made housing free lunch
No deal though
Used to always spittin hood before
I caught a dope deal
I rinse  to arena
Toes to 
Seen the motown lp saturday morning clean up
Mama in the kitchen
Papa watched sports yall
Respect the elderly
Respect everything they taught yall
Whip his ass for that report card
Daddys up  to have their sons sports cars
Forget what  promise to God


Niggas is mad I give em buts and excuses
This exclusive
Old school, cool new kid
Uhh, its like we verbally abusive
But dont blame me blame the producing
I guess its a blast from the past
Take a pocket full of cash
Make you  from the path
And aint a damn thing changed
Niggas still chasing dames with Dwayne Wayne frames
We used to play Connect 4
Now fast forward, we be connects for
My flows still up to date
My niggas still moving weight
Put more power in your plate
Than carnival funnelcakes
And I keep it on the up and up
The hood cowboy
All i do is buck and fuck
My life aint picture perfect
Just a nigga tryna make it out the 


Im down for the get down
Pound for the pitdown
Im the  thats what they call it for the sitdown
Gaming, Im selling by the pit now
I got a chain gang and we all get down
Frontin the cash
You know well spit rounds
My dudes will touch you with
Clear hold strip rounds
Im a lone ranger
Of the Stone rangers
Thats why shit stretch about 4 acres
Used to doubt me
Until you all caught the vapors
Then you on my dick
Everybody wants Raymond
One taking em
Honin them and clonin the greatest
You outdated
Im upgraded
I am the Matrix
Saved to mainframes and databases
Tryna hit me with a virus called playerhating
I got that hardware
Every shine devastated
Brooklyn, lime green, every  levitated







Rzarector in the shadow
True Master in the shadow
Golden Arms in the shadow
12 O'clock in the shadow


Crushed off the bag of dope, I felt pity
My cold thoughts revolve around New York City
Evidence are, in the tunnel where the train enter
Be the gat from the old time, '86 crime
Opposites attract, my electrical shine
OK Polly see me downtown with 2 peacocks with Rollie Fingers
We the Razor Sharp Wu-Tang singers, hum dingers
Try to connect with pros
Drug slingers keep heat under they clothes, everybody in the project knows my rap shot's hot
But suppose you get caught up in the mix
A non fix of convicts, conflict the prejudice, unrealistic
Politics, economics, chicks, counterfeit
2 faced cliques be getting rubbed like Vicks
Right off the dirty water, south of the border
Reporters and Cotton ball heads paid they quarters
To see the spectator perform, cameras are litting
The return of the swarm, the night time storm
Little kids got bit by the rap exorcist
My chainsaw mouth split tracks for the fuck of it
Travel wit the rich, politic
Put your money on my dick
Baby, Wu-Tang is Navy, Park Hill, Staten Island seal
Rock the Reel to Reel, we high hills deep
Creep, sweep beats off they feet
Teach in the cracks of the street
My family ain't complete unless the Abbot in the seat
South of the border


Shaolin in the shadow
Medina in the shadow
The Emerald City in the shadow


Mysteries revolve around my unorthodox sound
Splash you, I'm still the best in town
Striving for perfection wit my new rap investment
My testament, my own apartment, on a confy pay rent
More time is spent wise
Chambers of the Orient franchise, we fat like thighs
Too much French fries, not enough shake
RZA blow orchestra earthquake
No set date
Me and Bobby Steels got a cabin in Crystal Lake
Industries bug out hit Madison Square house
Roll the red rug out
I'm loyal to the Clan, dedicated to the South
South of the Border




Aiyo, spark that dutch, cuz my life is fucked up
Even my hustle game is nothing but tough luck
I stay in the street life, hoe took my truck
Scrambling for increase, so my kids can eat
I went savage when I felt the heat, you think something's sweet
Yeah, muthafucka, til the beast get in you
Go vampire on 'em, let the feast continue
For real, lord have mercy when I beat the venue
Rhyme sound so nice, you can eat the menu
G-O, spark that dutch, cuz your life is so ill
Shit on the line, and you might have to kill
Ribs is touching, what you know about street production
How you feel about living where the heats is busting
It's the same old shit when I release the button
Yo, spark that dutch, blow the sheets or something
(You know how we do...)


Yo, spark that dutch if you don't give up
Spark that dutch, nigga, cuz the streets is rough
Spark that dutch, nigga, for the hoes that fuck
Spark that dutch, nigga, til the stacks is up


Spark that dutch, get lifted on the back of the bus
Make a kid do a bid, ain't, nothing to tough
That we can't handle, get it like the watergate scandal
And scramble til the cakes done, and blow out your candle
Roll up a muscle, can't do nothing but hustle
And I'm broke, and I can't buy, nothing but trouble
I don't cuddle, but I hustle til the sun eclipse
And that's a long time coming, nigga, run your shit
I ain't done til I hawk and spit, on the track
Park and pump yac' in any hood on the map
It ain't where you from, it's, where you're strapped
And how you react, when the, pressue is on
Read it in reverse, like the, Holy Qu'ran
Through my sons I live on, my soul lurking through ya'll
And I advise ya, sky high, cuz it's curtains for ya'll...






Hold me down yall
Smitty, Yo that Smitty right there
Ohh shit they murked Smitty, Yo, Get up
Ohh shit, Yo, Niggas murked Smitty
Staten Africa, Put your hands up


The wrath of God through a deadly mic, I bring life
Touch the blind and bring sight to em
Killa Bees on the swarm I get Devils to fight through em
Staten Africa, It's no turning back, It's a massacre
Fire and Brim Stone, Ja Rule
Thirty-six chambers of bangers unite for the fight
Get your mind right, The armor of God crush your phasod
Allah Ho Akbar, Hit you real hard, Snow flakes the size of ice balls
Graffiti on the walls like hieroglyphics, Time ticks
Nobody know the hour, God Cipher Divine, Fetal through the lines
Knowledge of signs, Chaos of the world, Famine and pestilence
Burn an incense, It's intense, We found the evidence
And finger prints on the army tents, U.F.O.'s in the conference
To guard my circumference, Spear forcefully
Watch out, Spies in your house, Yo you best get out


Come on, Uhh, This one is like a fresh salad
(Shaolin shadow boxing, If what you say is true
The Shaolin could be dangerous) To all of my dun-duns


I don't like to bend my knees, I spit metaphors and similes
Against wars, Rims, And Bentley's, And although they do tempt me
Still I practice self and represent what is left
Of the truest E-M-C-E-E
I don't look down my nose, I never mug, Frown, Or pose
I just take control of the dispersed black soul
Then cock back let it go, Didn't re-cop at a store
Just let it bang, Spit the slang, Never let these niggas know
In a freeze I go face, Even when the World got me dazed I show face
And never would I ask for your praise, I'm too humble and soo shy
But never take my kindness for weakness
I'm still rep'n South Side til I die
Cross my heart and swear to live, I gotta do it for the kids
And the greatest of all time and don't know what time it is
I use thirty-six chambers to wake em up
Labody and Cappadonna slap you with nunchucks like pssshhhh




Riddim me a culture yall


Where my homeboys and homegirls?
You already know


You dont have to be at the studio
Just to let the verse out
That spiritual love in your heart
Just let it burst out
Spiritual love let the mice in the church out
Its the feeling that you get
When you grow up on the right route
For the trials is what you know
Life is all about
Forgiveness overcomes sins
And hell will hold town
Thats why imma hold it down
For all the people that are still loving
Come around
Wishing the best for em
Never want them on the ground
Staten island, worldwide
Put aside your pride
Killing hate shit
No more black on black crime
Focus on the present
And leave the past behind
Dig deep inside yourself
And youre sure to find
Find your spiritual love
Self and mankind


Look how long weve been striving and growing
Look at life compared to what you knowing
We see the facts son
We the chosen
Children of the most high god
Who could oppose him
Which emotion here
Could ever elevate
To the critical control
A nigga separate
This is spiritual love
That we reciprocate
One god, one life, one truth
Eliminate confusion
Its what the devil like to do
See im a soldier in the army of god
I rebuke him with the power thats invested
We manifest it
We couldnt stop it even if you could arrest it
Ma niggas poppin on the corner light refreshments
Get back into the crib and  for their assessments, huh
Could be the best shit a nigga ever cop
And ain't no violence in the verse
And so we make them buss a shot 




Seh well the most high will guide and protect them
Deliver weee
They try a ting but no quiver or shiver
Reverse situation
Damn near the damnation
Being hurt in my bases
Cant leave the plantation
You see
Blatantly fragrantly
Outdo your agents
Disgusting, you must think my people are vagrant
Empty you tempt me
Relentless for centuries
Repentance, my vengeance
Is promised to  zeen
I read your messages
Make your
Spit with diversity
None of that before rap
Cold rap assume that
Spiritually healing
Catch those feelings
Exposing the dealings
Pride for the biblical
Flows criticals
Spit fire
Brought you to my burp
Umbilical
Bun captivity
Baptism lyrical
True salvation is spiritual
Amaniyea






Uh-huh, ye-yeah, it's like this
If you got big dollars, Spit That G
KnowwhatImean? If you got mad honies, Spit That G
If you gettin dough or whatever
Whips, phats cars, new kicks, Spit That G

More sex and money make the world go round
Dumb Diddy snatch ya chick up, hit the floor now


Want money? I need bodyguards, as big as stiff worker, R.C
Me mega-poverty, New York City, dollar signs prevail
Five place love, exclusive, nine millimeters
My voice box run through tracks like wild cheetahs
Champagne and catfish at the club, Geda's
Janet Jackson figures, I'm on now
Gucci sweaters for all of my niggas
Calm braided, chrome rims
Ghetto birds with pink Timb's
A box of shells for the Cola for Kim's
Sponsored by the Clan, see
Pop more vanilla cherry than Luke Perry
Now tell me this ain't the thug life


Talkin bout the good life
Livin in da ghetto, wild


What happened to the fist fights, the MC battles, nigga?
Slingin newspapers on the Verrazano Narrow
Gettin off the fifth train on Carol to get wet
Summertime sweat got me rockin short sets
From the loaf tops, no socks, Hawaiian suits
Tied nicely with the wooden spoon for the scoop
Young girls playin double Dutch and hoola-hoops
Cap'n Crunch and Fruit Loops, camels and goose boots
It was the FUBU, the stripped Lee's, the Hoopty's
Five dollar bag of weed's a real bag of weed
A ki was at twenty g's, hurled one at dope fiends
O.D., niggas throwin bricks at my click
Now Giulianni got the state N.Y. locked like cuff
Black Bad Boys gettin rich like Puff
The Excursion truck need two spots on the parkin lot
A stash box for the top, the lock


Brook-nam, grace and charm, remain calm with chron's of Lebanon
Black man author, green Leprechaun from Lexington
P. Sunn, I crack ya face with the gun
Smack the taste outta ya dunn, ya fam's on the run
Now y'all respect Sunn, shine all type direction
Hype discretion with the right connection, recitin lessons
But my wea-pon reign automatic projection
Blow out ya reception, hose through ya reflection
Old gold complexion, Sunn I'll swoll to perfection
Did a fifteen, me and my team, supreme legends
Twenty-one-two, I get that money with the Wu
Up in the Cayman Islands, bitches sweeter than honey dew




Eh-yo, let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
Eh-yo, we be about it, be about it
Yo, we be about it (Killa Beez)
We all about it, yo we all about it
We all about it, we be about it
Killa Beez, yo we all about it


Yo I slap money for the love of rap money
Rock gully, high cop that bag of bomb
This grown man talk, I could bag ya mom
Watch and learn, block got lots of germ
Straight like that, bake cake, ate like that
Love to kill, I just hate like that
Yo these guns yap bodies on it, ain't nobody want it
Wide body six-hundred, brand new papers on it
Front roast up, corner thugs roast up
Mix the black with green, watch me mack the scene
As a matter of fact, them caps gon' bang
Brook-lawn pack those things, crack/cocaine







I know a lot of brothers that think that they can flow
But when I come through, it's like everybody's slow
One kid told me he used to be a pro
Until he bump heads with new Cappachino
You might of seen my face in the old school arena
Dipped like a fresh kid sipping on Pina
I'm a felony, y'all cats a misdemeanor
Eyeballing, all on my dick like Gina
Smiling, you're not really ready for the Whylin'
Came up strong but you scared of Staten Island
All on my chest, oh the big fat medallion
What you don't really want this here rut
Rhyme prostitute, rhyme slut
Battle wit dancehall king, you get struck by the lightning
I tear mics up, y'all need to quit
The name of this rhyme is I splashed the shit
Some of y'all sing like never before
I sleep all day while y'all trying to score
Then I wake up like Alien 3
Coming at y'all niggas that stole the rhymes from me
Bitch, this is how the poor got rich
Lay on the track then insert the hit
Nine months later, the rap world is pregnant
Wu babies blow kid, beware the segment
Rumor has it, Donna darts create magic
Nobody in my team have it
You've seen my face on a $20 dollar bill
Then you hear my voice on an Iron Man reel
It's all tragic, rule not the bull shit-atrics
Your rap is swine, mines is like catfish
Birthday rap style, come on make a wish




New York City stand up, Staten Island stand up
New York City stand up (don't you bother me, don't you bother me)
New York City stand up (old school style g.)


You nothin' but fallen stars, I see it on ya'll
Appear bizarre, Ol' Dirty boulevard
I've known global law, take his head Ceasar
Got babies like caviar, growin' evening star
God bless the dead, 2Pac Shakur
You can't divide war, this slim galore
Arabian flow, at nine a gigolo
With a bad hot ho, only cocaine up the nose
Incognito, defeat me, how so?
Rap K'd O, money green playin', go
Long ago, Protect Ya Neck video
Made me blow, on rap radio (Wu, Wu)


Staten Island stand up, New York City stand up
New York City stand up, New York City stand up


"For the ladies who know me, tell me how the fuck I be" ODB
"Dirty..." - Kelis


Brooooklyyyyyyyyyyn Zu, came through with the baby blue

We hustle in the street, niggas ain't fuckin' with Wu, so roll deep
Born God Body with the vest of heat
When the Bee Sting hit, niggas move they feet
Yo, we banned from the club, you best to not sleep
Keep somethin' on the waves, thug passion with the Alize's
Smack 85 percenters, right in they face
On some black pimpin' shit, like my dun-dun Huey
God Squad in the building, big bags of ooey
Push the phat shit like Dutch Tsasui
RZA bring all the shit, fuck these clowns
Ason Unique, yeah baby, hold me down
Original tag team, S.I. City
Ain't nothin' sweet kid, ain't nothin' pretty
Wu-Tang Forever, kid, keep it gritty




Call me Osirus, lyrical virus
Ol' school fire, straight from lockdown

O.D.B., now with Roc now




Oh baby, dedicated to all the pretty girls
All the pretty girls in the world, and the ugly girls too
Cuz to me you pretty anyway, baby




Yo Digem, (Yo, YO) Yo, Thanks for recording this joint man
(No problem my dude) Cause no matter what
We gotta stay shining, Through it all man, My heart is broke
It been broke for years, But I'm gonna keep on pulling through yo


Without the suffer and the pain and the hurt and the sorrow
How will we appreciate tomorrow
Without the tough times, Heartaches, Bumps and the bruises
How would we still love the music
Without the ups and the downs, And the ins and the out yall
How would we kill all without yall
Follow your dreams keep glowing, Let the love start flowing
Keep shining, It's God's perfect timing
Young ladies in the ghetto keep climbing
Young brothers in the hood stay grinding
Wipe my eyes cause I'm crying, Why these Devils keep lying
Why these Devils keep lying, Why these Devils keep lying
Why these Devils keep lying, Wipe my eyes cause I'm crying
Keep shining


I got a cross on my back, And my hands is pierced
I'm down with a hard team and my mans is fierce
Got a cable with a crown, Lord prepare my table
In the presence of the enemy, I never pretend to be
More then I am, I'm the truth in the way
I keep throwing love at you, Til my hairs is grey
Allah holds me, Brought me up out of affliction
Keep me safe from the heartache and crazy addiction
From the streets where the shorties be killing each other
Yo they wild like savages, Don't respect they Mother
They be selling crack for babies and cheating each other
Dumb, Deaf, And blind ass thugs, They still my brother
Wake up little homie get your mind out the gutter
What you know about grinding for that bread and butter
You's a stupid motherfucker, You don't know what it is
Now you think you thugged out cause you shooting at kids
Got them cracks in your ass like your ready to bid
Yo you living in them streets cause you can't get a crib
Let that teach your ass a lesson and shape you up
Before them Po-Po come around here and scrape you up
I think that crack gone kill yall before that dust
I came to shed a little light but your mind is stuck
All you talk about now is your nine and truck
Little homie, Keep shining




Hey little homie, Little momma
No matter what you do,You be yourself
(And keep shining) Digem Track Productions
Cappadonna, Peace to the Middle East
We out yall




Little Mike with the big head, He used to come around
Rob niggas on the block like he wasn't getting feed
He wore them all red outfits, His color was red
Tear drop in the corner of his eye like Lil' Wayne
Nose always running cause he sniffed cocaine
He used to come around with JoJo in this little white truck
On some South Shore shit, Like they ain't give a fuck
Now I ain't supposed to tell yall they sell guns round here
That cripple made dudes, And some got diarrhea
Jugs on every block but we live out here
And Staten Island be my nigga, Ben, Lilz, And Pop
Beating niggas up on the ave and take they rocks
Slim kid with the glass eye that know how to box
Staten Island's popular son got cut with the ox
See us racing down the terrace avoiding the cops
Cracks be in they asshole make they asshole hot
Run, If you ever pack a nice size gun
Or get caught with that shit then you fucked up son


Ayo, This one right here goes out for my Gee Street clique
My G's from Gee Street, Stack G's on some G shit
Narcs are circling sharks, Them Gee Street dicks
Five bucks fills the Dutch, Them Gee Street Knicks
Why my peoples had to go down for them Gee Street hits
Yo, I smells a, Someone a Gee Street snitch
Son slandered my name on that Gee Street strip
Yo, Heard that Dread ran him off the Gee Street clique
Picture hard to scale, It's heavy white, It's very hype
But every night the block smell like chicken on the grill
You ain't chef'n hard for real, You had ten grams B.C
Before cooked, You wound up getting seven on your scale
You shook, Stuck like the elevator doors
Stoned like Scram, Leathafase and Kawz, What


Yeah, Yo you's a lame bitch
Claiming you thing, You sang snitch
Meanwhile meet with the Marshall pointing at named pics
Your street credibility's shaky now
You better relocate before them hood dudes eat your face
But it seems you ready to meet your fate
So I'ma guess that you ready to die, On some Carlito's Way
So now you back on the ave, Two-five in the stash
Looking for someone to blast, So you can see your grave
Can't make no money now, Everybody's acting foul
It's all cause you didn't have no money for trial
We're not done yet, You see your way
And yet you got gagged and hog tied, Corn chip
You a Frito Lay, You better move out quick yo
Leave those trays, And get snitching out your life son
True G's don't stray




Subliminal thug-ism
Rap mysticism
For all my niggas locked with life in state prison
We combinate, like dime piece and sperm jizm
Queens niggas going to trial, just sit and listen
Fake crooks come in all types of categories
Beat you in the head with lies and war stories
Claiming that they name ring bells in territories
With Fat Cat, Al Capone, Scarface
Meanwhile they going to trial for rape case
You weak, I punch you in face, cut your face
You halfway, wanna-be thug, stay snitchin'
Latin King, surgery-type with face stichin'
The house game? missile style? play in the kitchen
Allow me a god for real, Sallah position
Performers, weak convicts you shouldn't fool wit
They foul, snitchin' on the niggas they went to school wit
But now, you catch them in the club on some smooth shit
Shuh-poww!! blow'em out the frame on some prove shit
I'm not the type of cat you wanna fool wit
It's strange fruit, yo



The world plant seeds in my mind, strange fruit
Survivalist, basing my life on rap loot, it's the truth


The world plant seeds in my mind, strange fruit
Survivalist, basing my life on rap loot, it's the truth


The world plant seeds in my mind, strange fruit
Survivalist, basing my life on rap loot, it's the truth


The world plant seeds in my mind, strange fruit
Survivalist, basing my life on rap loot, it's the truth


Aiyo, the world plant seeds in my mind, then it's dart time
They used to be crime, scary hours, robberies, and big chrome nines
In Park Hill, when the cameras don't never be off
I live inside the TV, these words is hot sauce
Put your mind back together, Killa Bees of course
Church in the studio life you can't abort
Pete Rock and Don make the world pay child support
You under arrest for giving out stress, I'm not settling for less
Each bags? Midtown, in the wild, wild west
Representin' some deep impact
Aluminum Wu bat, I got it like dat, slang combat
I plant two seeds in your head, kid stand back
What? What? What?




Nigga you know better
I blow three thru ya 'Lo sweater
Fuck what you think
I'm bustin' you blink
Nigga see me in the club, start ducking and tucking they link
Like I resorted to robbing niggas for table scraps
In the hood we do away with cats
And in the river threw away the gats
Everywhere I go turn crime scene
Knowhatimean?!?
Don't make me trip, make me flip
Be so much bloodshed, you think I'm a Crip
Even before I signed the contract, I always was respected
Couldn't give a fuck if I never sold another record
I ain't in it for the cream
As wild as it seem
Battle me and win? hahahah! In your dreams!
I'm still a young nigga
Straight up dumb nigga
For no apparent reason, pull out the gun nigga
It's not the drugs nigga
I just a thug nigga
So whatcha wanna swallow
Your pride or blood nigga?!?






Uh-huh (yeah) uh-huh (my fuckin' Street Flavor)
Fuckin' ping-pong head (Ratchet Rush)
Street Flavor (fifty-one, thirty-six) Street Flavor
Ya new neighbor, nigga (give it to ya niggas one time)
Betcha jump up on my dick now, shit is bonkers...
You fucking idiot


Wicker man, trigger man, post on top of the hill
Get a Gram', flip a grand, try and hop through a mill
If I blew the steele, concealed at the top of my sweats
I pop you for real, aim for the top of your chest
Fuck the respect, power's all I need today
In that LC Lex so I can speed away, you know?
I don't think so, I didn't expect you to
You got powers, plus cops posted next to you
Listen to the cash flow, rap flow like Fidel
Castro, asshole, dude you get in the shell
Oooh, we sippin' the L, cee-lo, blowin' sticky-sticky
Navigator posted, sittin' high on them mickey-mickeys
Watch 'em drop fifty in yo city, from that icky-icky
Calico, strip 'em shells through your whole residential
See only presidents be blowin' spliffy like a rasta wit me
That chopper with me, pop a copper just for actin' iffy
Leave 'em stank and pissy, Cali pearl handle murder murder
Burn by my sermon, I'mma hurt 'em when I turn it on 'em
Steady serving on 'em, swervin' 'on 'em in that fishy-fishy
V12, Lex drop, blow ya top, tippy-tippy


I destroy mics quick, leave parties crippled
Get down on the track, just sweat and ripple
Start commotion when I rap, my steeze'll get you
Only if you hood for real, my steeze hit you
Butterfly fuck niggas, bees'll sting you
Niggas that sling dope, I hope the d's don't get you
Stay on the low, kid, breeze with the pistol
For all my real niggas get g's with the pistol
Hold your hood down, nigga, cheese is the issue
Raise your guns up, nigga, squeeze and let loose


Ready quickly niggas know I gets busy
Made 'em lifty-lifty off the ground
When the pound hit, at a miscy muffler's rap
It ain't no sound bitch, now remy marty, marty crown
With the light Bacardi, now I wanna fight somebody
Nigga, pass the shotty-shotty, twizzy twelve gauge
Mossberg with the stocks off, shoot ya block off
With the mack when I pop off, fuck the drop off
Take the paper straight to papi papi
I've been cookin' cutter that's pitching on your blocky blocky
Snitches try to stop me, sending word to the copy copy
But I'm never sloppy, so I beat it, nigga watch me, watch me
Like a big screen, fifty inches in the living room
Just consider moves, that I make, type forbidden dude
Niggas tend to do, what they see, like a baby baby
Sonny acting shady with three eighties on they lady lady
Maybe they won't play from a distance, lizzy long range
This is strong game, like Gotti tephlon frame
You stepped on chains, just respected to the Pocono's
Cappa smoking bones, of that sticky-icky malibu
Bizzy green as a moon, no, we gon' throw it up
Put it in the air, Don pizzy P, Mo' it up


Yeah, nigga, Street Flavor
4-4-3-3-0-6-9-7-6-2, nigga, we do what we gotta do
Ratchet Rush, nigga Don Don, what's up
Goon Squad Hooligan...



"Street Rhymer in superposition" - 4X


But I can't go easy on 'em man
I can't go easy on 'em, hahahah

I might've went lighter but they all biters
I'm a freestyler and a writer, they neither
They can't face this tiger, I'm nicer
Brighter, tiger, these cats hiding out like al-Qaeda
I got these clubs locked down like Elmira
You rap minors are whiners, you rap like vaginas
I take it back to sixty-niners
Black low-top with three stripes on the side sir
I'm the truth for these liars
They try to downplay my legacy like Public Enemy
But I'm a Street Rhymer in superposition
There's like ten of me and all of 'em dissing
In the past, present and future position
You need to listen, when Kris is in you getting christened
I'm on a mission to preserve what I'm spitting
I was written and if I'm freestyling, wires hidden
Stop fishing for beef, you all chicken
You turkeys need a tomato so let us start spitting

"Street Rhymer in superposition" - 4X


Tribe of Shabazz, cocoa and hash, persian Don' Don'
Lean back and we chilling with jag
Baby what's up? Boots Gore-Tex, jeans munched up
Good with the six-pack, stomach is crunched up
Hula hoop New York, swing around, take loot
Niggas got guns but they scared to shoot
Cops chase 'em in the building, they run to the roof
We in the projects, put the window down, park the coupe
Ring around the Rosie, spark the snoot
Eyes all red like you was hiding truth
True Master swing beats, sword cut your roots off
Hit y'all with lectures, y'all mind was too soft
Villains for life, New York, Stat' and Africa
Walk slow, yo the Feds always after ya
Keep a cellphone that's able to take flicks
Just in case the po'-po' hit you with they sticks

"Street Rhymer in superposition" - 4X




(... it's like I'm back in the guts, the worlds
The streets, the projects, it's always a struggle
No matter what you do)
Struggle with this, come on ya'll, struggle with this
Struggle with this, come on ya'll, struggle with this
Struggle with this, come on ya'll, struggle with this


All ya'll fake ass niggas, what you know about this?
Album after album, like I don't give a shit
And you still writin', you ain't flippin' no bricks
And you got a big mouth, but you ain't go no hits
You just a squirrel in the path, about to get ran over
Your talk game is good, but where your Land Rover?
You never had a whip, you never had no chips
You was lookin' for Don', while I was takin' long trips
Came back to Park Hill and I flexed my kits
Smoke greens with ya'll niggas, come on, get a grip
Stop frontin' like you can't see.. (what?)
Deep down inside you wanna be like me
And get a little more fame and a little more pussy
But you so jealous of me, plus you kick dirt
That's the reason why ya'll niggas can't work..
Yo, yo, come on, ya'll, struggle with this


We up early in the morning, and all night
We keep the armor of Allah on, ready to fight
Come on, ya'll, struggle with this, keep it tight
Because I, am, thee, un-, ordinary life!


Yeah, come on ya'll, struggle with this
Come on ya'll, struggle with this
Come on ya'll, struggle with this
(Aiyo, Cap, one of those round math')


I'm rarely seen, cuz I'm out, chasin' my dreams
Microphone fiend, way before I was a teen
Mitch Green niggas all get punched in they eye
Challengin' the champ, like I won't take their pride
Or kick they hide, from here to the Westside
Tell you rest in the flesh, even the best done tried
Comply, or you'll be assassinated
I'm dated and faded, download it and save it
I made it, easier for the media
So you could understand me, without the slang Enclyopedia
Stay weeded up, like the kettel gettin' headed up
Talkin' bout the kid, but I already beat it up
In the cut, like peroxide, or iodine
Optimus shine, here to decline your slot time
Rock rhymes on point like a porcupine
And if my ass get left back, I'mma catch up/Ketchup like Heines
And define definition of an M.C
Tempt me, I ain't got a lot to give, I got plenty
Since you went from 103 to 104
Them dumb ass broads talkin' 'bout them more and more
From shore to shore, I laid down my law
And walk my Adidas on Colleseum floors
Score like Fugee, Rhyme & Reason first movie
I ain't gon' rest til I see Flex black a tooly
One bad mooly, who lost his cool-io
With this Julie ho, gettin' brains in the studio
Figadoh! Return of the phantom of the opera
Pop a collar, pop it for Mr. Popular
I could see through binoculars that you've been watchin' us
Your best bet is to get your money set and start coppin' us
Before the deeds knock us, and push petal charges
And fall off the face of the earth like slaughtered Sergeant

[Interlude: King Just (Cappadonna)
Come on ya'll, struggle with this (yeah, do it, right)
Come on ya'll, struggle with this (Staten Island, stand up)
K.J. all day, Donnamite (get fucked up)
Come on ya'll, struggle with this




Yeah, Hollyhood, come on, ya'll struggle with this


I've been strugglin' a few years, now I'm back
All ya'll stupid muthafuckas best to learn how to act
I ain't here to rap with you or here to clap with you
Cappadon', I'm just back on the map with you
Plus I'm gettin' it hot, ya'll hatin' ass niggas not gettin' a lot
Scheming like a fiend and when the joint in the block
Know you can't get down, nigga, what you got?
Big Don' beyond plot, stay low in the block
With the Glock, told them niggas in Crimestock
Hold ya head, it's gonna pop
Keep comin' home, we gonna rise to the top
Like one in the dome, nigga, we refuse to stop
Don't get it twisted, the Bees gon' drop
But the heat's still rising and ya'll gonna get it
It's me, Big Cappadon' with the fitted
And my goretex shit with the FUBU knitted
And I'm coming back for all ya'll niggas that shitted
Kid back off, my thoughts make you wanna clap off
Run from Don, I tear the wax off
Osama Island, nigga we been wildin'
Struggle with this, come on ya'll, fuck talent!


Struggle with this, put that work in
Come on ya'll, struggle with this
Homicide Hill, come on ya'll, grizzly
Struggle with this...

Golden Arms, yo
Meth-Tical, John John do your thing thing
What? Check it


The all eye seein, heavenly divine
The truth brings out, the temper in my spine
A Hill sound again, feelin symptoms that bit me
I feel for you victims, with everything up in me (uh-huh)
A head ringa, stuffed in sidewalls of frenzy
Back the fuck up, cause I'm stimmi off the Remi
A semi bloodshot eye, donkey dick of nuts
Every cut, I split and try and felt the guts (what?)
Nigga what, earthquakin speech, woofer hissin
The razor faced victims, WHEW, that's what kissed em
Appropriate precaution, surroundin, certain it curtains
I'm dumbfounded, I'm poundin, the pavement
For mental enslavement, I'm cravin, a misbehavin savior
America the grave for gun wavers (what?)
The wave runners, what the blood seed again
Make you wonder, about the thunder underneath the skin (hmm)
The sapphire rhymes slap fire out your minds
With right timin, bite with vampire rhymes


Hmm, I spy, with my crooked eye
Full metal street soldiers, born to die
Put em up yeah fuck yeah, when it's Hammertime
Niggas can't be touched here, the true and livin
Night vision unseen, like Gene
When I hack men The Unforgiven, left in prison
In the Wu-Tang dirty dungeon, now you succumbin
To my twelve part dirty dozens, flabbergasted
By tracks that be True Mastered, opposites attract
Beef plus they ass backwards, stick yourself
Til I'm felt, this ass whoopin, is bein dealt
Like hot beans-and-butter nigga, I got the belt
What the deal huh? Swing low, sweet chariot
I walk the Underground Railroad, with Harriett
Just a slave to the rhythm - victims I'm like alien
About to put that shit up in em, I Can't Live
Without My Radio, a 100 Miles and Runnin
T2 Judgment day comin, nobody's safe
When I reminisce about Case, still hit the staircase
When the coppers give chase, I give em finger
The only hip-hop singer, to tell America
To kiss his Killer Bee stinger, nothin can save ya
From this major misbehavior, heavy hands
Layin corners in the elevator, guard your grill


I speculate, get my darts straight, don't exaggerate
Dictate, do it with the Papermate, set the plate
Set the bait, checkmate, fuckin with cha mental state
Double take, meditate, earthquake, VGL contemplate
Big boys integrate; catch you at the sess skate
Army tank, high rank, got the bank
Got the shank talk the talk walk the walk from New York
To Up North to downstate to L.A., to all day
To cliches to instant replays, to all the DJ's
To BJ's in the PJ's, equality days
With money like legs I plant eggs, Pele roundhead
The dog bred, snakes runnin from red, catch dead
Raekwon is on, take your uniform, we perform
Shit like gangs in Now Born, check for new Don
Fuck a Yukon, you been warned, we the realest
We never were conned, duffed out and knowledge born

Verse 1: Cappadonna

She a super model
33 - 33 throttle
Love the way her body shaped
Shaped like a bottle
Save it till tomorrow
I'm like Zorro
CC leaving marks on your tee-tees
Love you in your Nikes
The sweet sea breeze
Make me fall to my knees
If it's possible
Can I get a set of keys
I swallow your tasty's
BBC's they come in all varieties
Hire me
Hire CC
I'm a liar
But gimme, gimme
My middle leg get you skimmy
Take this shit like a shot of Remy
Bend over let me introduce you to Rover
Until it's over
Now you sober
Put your leg back on my shoulder
I'm a scrub like you
And plus one piece of ass'll just can never do
My new 75 wives's coming through
One female that live near the Bronx zoo
Had to be home no later than 2
And the 2 twins with the hour curfew
The light-skinned females one's you call Boo
THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT YOU!



She a super model
33 - 33 throttle
Love the way her body shaped
Shaped like a bottle
Save it till tomorrow
I'm like Zorro
Starsky leaving marks on your tee-tees



Chocolate milk you look good in your silk
Put your body on tilt
Take me for 2 G's
Even though we not married
I make love to you
You can call me Larry
Call me anything
Don't trap me with the ring
I'm a one night fling
On the road trying to sing
Yeah you a queen but C-Donna ain't your king
My dress code switch it make you wanna swing
A little episode
I would have done it before but now you look old
Sex on the first night thats how I roll
Fronting on a crust being assed in the cold
Try to play live what?
Lady on a stroll
Rack my Versace but can't pay the toll
All Cappuchino women y'all got to go
The love that I feel for women is untold
Sweet or sour ladies if you got babies
If you wanted to hit a nigga off in the eighties
Jump in the Mercedes girl it's all true
THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT YOU!

Hook

Verse 3:Cappadonna

Knew a girl named Cindy
Her sister named Don
They used to come around with Shallah Raekwon
A couple of years before the Wu was even on
They love the way I dress captivated by my charm
If you see me in the cut I'm just steadily calm
It's a regular females be under my arm
Ever since I got paid to start dropping the bombs
I could take 2 women my nickname is LONG
Crushing is involved I'm doing the James Bond
Grant you a fantasy then I be gone
That's under the hat the way I made you come back
From the shoes to the hat
All of my shit match
I'm like a book of matches
I'm always on strike
I'm double-jointed I can do it how you like
Come to Keisha house
Yeah it's only right
We can get together for a glass of ice
And if the kids here something we can tell em it's a fight
I love my 2 seeds more than my own life
It's hard to escape punani appitite
I see a pretty face I start falling in lust
No matter what baby girl I just can't get enough
Because THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT YOU!

Outro:Ghostface Killah(Cappadonna)

Word





Yeah things wanna hop out cabs and shit, yo check it out...
Yeah I was chillin' in my cab
Picked up these four niggas
I could tell by the look on they face that they was trickin'
So I took them to they rest stop
They pulled out the thicket
Said they was going to kill me
Then they took the weapon
So I bust off my clothes, I started to skip
I got to my man blue house I feel like shit
 We plan no attack
And two weeks later we got the wind back
Dumb niggas out here wanna rob and steal
And hit them banks motherfucker that's keepin it real
And ain't nobody gonna squeal
Cut that bread out
Everybody get a mil
'Sno turning back now
Hope nobody don't lose it
This is just what the fuck you gotta do for the music
Hip hop!



Yeah, yeah, yeah
The picture's on the corner
By the bank waitin to make the ins
I take a step to the curb
Heard a person yell "Take his bread!"
Searchin' for the problem
I got him right when he made a left
On the street in a Jeep
Seen him tryin' to break his neck
Passin' off and pack to the back of the cab
Cappadonna's drivin'
I feel these stupid motherfuckers eyein'
We pack stilettos and black metal
Plant one in your chest
Watch your back open and bloom like flower petals
But they bogus I know it they keep rollin'
Maybe they see him playing
Bronze in a van with the door open
Just grinnin'
Waitin' for Bis and 80 to make withdrawals
Cut the phones drop the workers, take it all
Walk out the front door, we all made off
Just like Bernie, fuck a jury, raise hell til they burn me



Yeah
Hi-end fascist splashin'
Lone wolf baby in a stroller
Style cobra
Super Ninja solar with soldier
Gold chain code of conduct
Million dollar plots flood my Motorola
Get it at all costs
This is a movie about a mob boss
Ice  Mafia illegal yard cross
Medallion is mural
Money exchange strange dinero
We back on the block spending nothing but Euros
Stashin' a box:
Hash, Glocks, gloves, a machete, Koran
A couple black mask and a top
We transform like robots
Run up on you with guns for fun
Extort every member part of your co-op
I let the K scream for say supreme
In the street chasin' fiends
This is the lifestyle that Jason bring
Na-mean?
My military regime fuckin' over your whole team



Germaine's quatrain
Modern day Mark Twain
Heating up a golden fin shark soup of lo mein
Burn Hollywood, burn
Motherfucker wait your turn
I flick the ash from the sherm in the urn
Never argue with crazy people, you're gonna lose
I sit in my room and watch the magnetic north move
Jog the place until my shoe soles rip off
And just replace it with a moleskin offa my wall
I'm a writer so I write things down
I try to live life righteous
But I can't right the wrongs right now
So do not stand at my grave and cry
I am not there because I did not die
I don't care what you focus on
I was drawn to the 
Killah Priest told me   Capricorn golden arms
Blacker than the upper torso of the onyx statue
That belonged to Saddam
Locate the Star Gate five minutes before it close
A black hole force from a source code
10,000 mile an hour indicated speed
My space trap barrel rolls 90 degrees
I press right left pedal flair auto rotation midair
I wade through the meteors in the atmosphere
I'm Woody Harrelson on top of the mountain
Shoutin', "Praise the god of Rastafari fountain!"
 they carry the warrior
From Astoria New York to Africa Pretoria
Listen in the vertical horizon, an audio slave
"She was the best you ever had, Germaine"
I'm a futuristic gap-teethed Bokeem Woodbine
Call weather predator, 2Pac of good times
Life is just a serious of patterns til the cycle is broken
My mind is open my thoughts are born
The word is spoken I am the chosen
God damn suspense, so far
One-way trip to Cassiopeia
Shit rolls downhill, rainwater drops on my head
Chip's on my shoulder, that's how I feel






Excuse me gorgeous..


Just maxing, looking for hoes, y'know, relaxing
Met this redbone Jasmine, midtown Manhattan
Shot a verb, that tranked her nerves, calm words
Massaged the mentals, made her pussycat purr
Sweet Love you look miraculous, brown-eyed passionate
High cheek-boned, Tommy Girl cologne you smashing it
Jump in, take a spin, destination Staten
I have you home by ten, shorty started laughing
She replied, "Street, you ever ride while you drive?"
I looked puzzled, and said, "Nah baby why?"
She pressed up, grabbed my dick, threw her dress up
Cocked her legs, cold fucked my head up
Now I'm deep in it, flying past the speed limit
Out of control, still whipping it, steadily hitting it
Deep stroking, one hand on the wheel, blunt smoking
Loving how it feel, sweet Love you got me open, what?


Love is love Love, love is love Love
Love is love Love, love is love Love
We connected like a train from the first ordeal
I stepped to her with the passion as I kept things real
But like, sex was on my mind like, cum was in my pants
I flashed my fronts on her, like if I had a chance
She said, "Ain't you Cappadonna from the Wu-Tang Clan?"
I said, "Yeah, mad gear plus the small white band
Sweet Love, I want your pussy can I be your man?
Stripped to the bare essentials let me fuck you if I can
Sweet Love, from your nipples to your pussy nub"
Sweet Love, love is Love, love is love Love


It's a full moon, we in the bedroom, thoughts consumed
By the passion, slow jam tunes and body action
My finger's on the clit splashing, your pussy lips
Got you spazzing, love juices, marinating
In your satins, sexy ass, I gets em like my old dad
I love my women bad, with just a little touch of class
You'se the Star by far, look at you ma
Shake your thang-thang girlfriend, you Shay Shay La Fah!
Whattup, went to beat it up, I'm not the one to eat it up
But the type to hit it raw dawg and seed it up
We talk without sayin nuttin', you told me if I came through
You'd gimme som'thin', now we locking ass
Pulling hair and talking trash, how you like it
Slow or fast? She said, "I like it when it last"
No doubt, you got the best trout there can be
Not an everyday, average, Chicken of the Sea
Candidate for H.I.V, you'd rather deal with monogamy
Queen to be held, Black Mahogany
You're 'bout to bust damn it, sugar walls coming down
Now you can't stand it, you've been touched
That's when I felt the blood rush
Getting closer and closer with every thrust, take me there
Volcano's about to erupt, I love you much
Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts




Yo Cap, put down that blunt son
Yo God, speak on them corpses God
(Vanglorious, Cappadonna, worldwide vocabulary groceries
1996, before bio-chips, protect ya forehead and ya hand
Third world society, Cappachino, forever
Drastic Measures) Flip me some of that old Wu-Gambino


I politic, anti-dustic, Donna take drastic
I smashed it, wack rap niggas, we open caskets
Too many crossed, picture me lost, I roll with more force
My resume', top secret, deep like CIA
The whole area +Under Siege+, my slang is bugged out with steez
It's the attack of new era rap, Cappa stay strapped
Park Hill forever, plus Orlando on the same map
My man look, don't eat pork kid, danger like New York kid
RZ' bomb, Jay bomb tracks from on a pyramid
Drastic Measur-nation, the world classic legislation
Third world order, third world cyber creation


"True to the game" "Donna take drastic" -] Cappadonna (3X)
"Initials untammed for you and your crew.."
"Drastic.."


Wiz was poor, the scream, so ya need to wait
Dial-tone, ya hate, but, they become ya face
Makes, contemplate, checkmate, it's too late
Got, quick lock, crime time, slot box, too
Who knew, that the Drastic crew and Cappadonna-Wu
Would have rappers call in sick like they had the flu?
UPS barcode that'll bass box moves
Foes and hoes knows the Drastic rules
But no, it don't hold, the productivity still flows
Strick full calls at the man at the stands
Wannabe jacks at hand but ain't nothin at hand
They rockin, pop-lockin, stoppin all competitors from talkin
My Glock slot won't stop 'til I reach the top
That's my mot' hot when my pot lock off the rock




Number one, I'm the hot star rasta hiphopster
Wealthy rock star eatin pasta
I work that crack off by mantaining my posture
Pleasureable heterosexual asexual individual
Too busy thinkin about openin up fat ass resta-views
Slicin up silly suckers with violent gimmick tricks
I'm doin backflips, Van Damme kicks and plummets
Like roundhouse, hut, hut, hut, huh, Duece Biggalo
Upside ya head, out goes ya tooth
Spit out and shut up, cuz once ya broke I really get loose
I'm rackin wack rappers on Belgian benches so check it out
Featherweight, I press that booty up like a record
Yea, I don't mean to talk about 9 Glocks
Cuz you can't MC like I MC, how I MC
Who am I? The original, more corrupt
I'm just the man shinin new lights on ya brain
New school with a twist, yo true to the game




Maintainin, politicin, Drastic style
Comin with that street slang mentality
You know what time it is, Drastic.. kid..

Blood money mercenaries, think you can muscle Wu?
It's a foot race, who can out-hustle who?
Hip hop junkie flunky, monkey see, monkey do
Great minds connect like mobster rings
Sit back, let me do my, Sinatra thing
I'm in the Hip Hop Hall of Fame, on the wall is the plaques
Old ball and chain, I named her Madam X
She love big cannons, sex unprotected
You better respect it, kid, we 'bout to set trip
You get ya neck ripped, eyeballs are scoping
I don't sell crack, I sell dopium
Catch him at the podium, nah, he moving too fast
Professor X, behind the bulletproof glass
You need a Wu pass, a bag of that high
Easy with the flicks, baby, I'm camera shy

We might have to 8 Diagram one of y'all MC's
We grind everyday and we hustle for cheese
Got our face on the front of CD's, we off the hook
W.T.C. y'all soft and shook
Y'all not built like the Cuban Linx Clan that get CREAM
And back heads down every time we sing
Give us a hundred grand for a show, let us rock
For more money, more chicks, more private stock


They call me Streetlife, slap the taste
Out ya mug, know ya place, you ain't thug, fix ya face
Throw a slug, catch a case
Meanwhile, beat trial, back on that cash cow
Getting CREAM, however, a street brother know how
Point blank, I'm pulling rank, calling shot, I got bank
Pass the rock, my hand's hot, hit 'em with the showshotter
Peace to my ala mater, Wu-Tang block scholars
Never settle for less, promoters pay us top dollar

The Clan'll talk, Calabama niggas all'll quit
Talking that short dick shit, we was s'posed to be cool
Only the clue's on the other end of the stick
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Over-crowded police blood bamboo bimbo
Chickenhead skeezer crackrock hoodrat
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Barney here is down to a feeding dreadlock
Armpit like two Buckwheat's in a headlock
Macy Gray's hair between your leg lock
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Ya mother's so cross-eyed, when she cry tears roll down her back
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
 This shit is strong, god damn, what you got in there?
Over-crowded police blood bamboo bimbo
Chickenhead skeezer crackhead hoodrat
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Ya mother's so cross-eyed, when she cry tears roll down her back
Calabama niggas all'll quit
Talking that short dick shit
Speak up, no loud speaker but I'm speaking loud
Venacular ass kicking, truth got there in crowd
Shit, they call me the lethal lip
The linguistic, full metal jacket of venacular ballistic
Shooting out at the mouth without Chap or Blistec
Here's a mothafucka, I didn't flunk diaper rash
I'm verbally toxic, metal-piercing, forked, hollow point tongue
Dum dum, pow, shot from gattling gums
Hooked on phonics, packing a vicious vocabulary
Malicious, with malice and mayhem
Fuck a dictionary, give me the mic and I'll slay
Them and literally poetic symptoms
Pissing me the fuck off, missing me with that shit
I stick a venacular foot so far up in ya ass
You won't be able to pass verbal gas
So far in ya ass that one of my knees will rise so far above ya head
And you drown of a poetic ass kicking
Leaving lyrical lacerations on your lungs, from a verbal hangnail
That hung on my big toe, as I flow upward
Kicking yo on ya eardrum, you wanna hear some?
Tap dance on ya tonsils, leaving kiwi shoe polish on ya breath
Cavity in ya best rhyme, and I'm the access on the rest
Call me the proverbial verbal menacing dentist
With the drill, I got lyrical skills
I could perform oral root canals
It's unwise to fuck with me
Kick ya wisdom teeth down ya throat
Leaving you to choke
On where it hurts, unspoken vocals
Tying down ya vocal cord and windpipe tight
With toe jamming and ya mothafucking hemmoroids
Fuck the dumb shit...





I swear to tell the truth
I swear to never lie
I swore to keep it hood until the day I die
The praying that I fail
The praying that I fall
But you can pray all you want it ain't no help for ya'll


I'm praying on my mamma, on my grandma Imma live more
I swear to keep it real -?????????????
(until I'm dead and gone)
Imma represent the struggle
And Imma stay humble so until everybody rumble
But you gotta hustle
Imma keep it hood 'til the day I die
An I'll make sure it's understood that I never lie
I never make a deal with the devil and exchange for my soul
The vanity, the sanity for fang that I know
They get blind by the bright light, sold by the fast cars
Lost in the night life, burned by the bad girl
(Ain't this material world, such an infurious world?)
But everybody wanna live it
And they don't really care what they got to give up to get it
The industry's infested with this evil with this spirit
That's why this song on radio you'll probably never hear it
But I still spit the real


I swear to tell the truth
I swear to never lie
I swore to keep it hood until the day I die
The praying that I fail
The praying that I fall
But you can pray all you want it ain't no help for ya'll
I hope I hope I hope I hope
I pray I pray I pray I pray
That heaven's got a ghetto and waiting for me
I hope I hope I hope I hope
I pray I pray I pray I pray
That heaven's got a ghetto and waiting for me


Yo, Imma keep it real with you
You ain't building with me then I can't chill with you
My mind is on getting that family right
The industry don't care about your family life
I pray to God that we always keep the family tight
Tell the truth never sellin' out for the loop
Never lie but I still wanna get high
So hooded with it that's how we getting' by
Yea, and this deceptional world I'm an exceptional pearl
I'm always gonna be street, I always live what I speak
And I ain't sayin' that I'm perfect
But wickedness can't defeat my spiritual purpose
I'm in a God, yo my soul ain't for purchase
Hoping that I pray that everything was worth it





(Yeah)
Yeah!
This one is dedicated to Wu-Tang, Staten Island,  all of my fans
Straight up and down
Brooklyn where I was born at the Jewish hospital
And 'errebody who said I wasn't gonna make it
This one is for you!
Let's go
Yo
Check it out, Let's get it
When at the night of the party when all through the crib
Another MC was there, no bitch my can share
The toolies was hung by the bushes with care
Just hoping that some static would soon fill the air
The posse would form a face with our dreads
While visions of fly girls danced in they heads
With some cream in the rentals, and others on feet
They shout it and chant it and call it OG
OG, OG, OG, OG
L-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l lounging, L-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l lounging, L-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l
Now while was at the age of 18 I was an MC fiend
Need a rehabilitation to release my steam
I've been rhyming so long and now I'm finally home and I ain't saying I'm the best but I've never been told it
Yo I'm a cool poet, not an alcoholic
Rhyme is so correct take a week to install it
You could call my brother say


((Still working on it.))




Yo, Check it out man
All yall dudes, And all yall chicks
Pay that money at the door, Getting searched
Don't try to place the razor under the sneaker
Don't try to put that gun up in your wig yo
Cause I can see you, Diglah, Yo, Check it out
Up in the club like what
You know what it is man, Me and my whole clique, Yo


It's that club type shit, That make you nice
It's that Henny in that cup without that juice and ice
It's that gang banger shit, That make you bleed
This that Staten Island shit, Yo that smack a weave


Ayo, All in the club like what, Balling it up
Bebe Con Dunks, Strut when I step in the cut
Got my eyes on honeys and I'm feeling they stuff
Me and my man Luck Star yo we back in effect
Got them hard ass beats like we packing a tech
And everybody in the joint steady breaking they neck
Got thugs in the back mixing greens with wet
Moe spilling on my clothes and the party is set
I go for real all night til the sun start to rise
And I'm back on the block again flipping them pies
Me and my man Luck Star bagging all of the chicks
While they getting they eagle on yo we hop on they tits
Make em lean back some more on they can hop on the stick
And nobody can stop us, We caught in the mix
Got that fresh gear on like we caught in the flicks
Grab sweeties by the waistline, Rubbing our shit
Come on tell me that you like my moves
Go baby girl, Tell me how you like my grooves
Got baggy jeans on with my Timberland shoes
Ride honeys from the back and they loving the cruise
Step right to my business, Any shorty I choose
Put it all up in her dress with she shake in her shoes
Me and my man Luck Star stay thug'n em out
Kiss em while they on the dance floor yall
Straight bug'n em out
Got haters on the sideline, Cussing em out
Can't wait to get em home, Start bust'n em out
If they don't wanna act right, Start smut'n em out
Make em drink more Henny, Start gut'n em out
Rock a big fat chain, King Tut in the house
You can't knock Don, That's what the hustle about




I need a chick that can shake her ass, She know how to move
Got plenty of cash, Got the glow like Stacey Dash
In the buggy eyed Benz, Keep a Glock in the stash
Rock Perry Ellis, Liz Claiborne slacks
With a body like Eve and her ass is fat
Always down for a nigga, Never giving it up
You know her stuff stay tight while we living it up
Take trips out to Paris yo, Sip'n it up
Dine at the ill spots, Yo we tip'n it up
I take two or three chicks, Not giving a fuck
Call little clay waist, Start pack'n the truck
It's like that, Take a cruise and I'll be right back
All the chicks on the block wanna know where I'm at
I like em classy, All the way down to hood rat
With your Timberland boots on, Scarf to match
Army fatigue with your tight jeans, Face is means
Getting the type of chick tryna make my Queen
And it really don't matter to me
Cause I'm looking at your ass and that shit got fatter to me




Yo, Throw me that four-four
Booger Foot City







Everyone wants that ambush
Everybody got killed in that ambush
You've got nowhere to come but this way
The only one thing they see is God
You could go in between and feel the fire
Then buckle up!


The Ambush.. it be The Ambush
What? It be The Ambush
What? The Pillage
(Yo, yo, Killa Bees)


Yo.. Ambush, bag 'im, hands behind the back style, gag 'im
Grab 'im by his head, start to drag 'im
Kick 'im while he's down, fast first in the ground
My thirsty bloodhounds surround your compound
We want all we want when we want it
The rules of this rap game, MC's come to be hunted
We're like oxen, and this be the anti-toxin
Corrective, here to put you back in perspective
Gun check, Remedy, +Protect Ya Neck+
Bring the swords up, hit the deck, disconnect
One glance and it's evident, the war's begun
Brave men wield their swords and their shields in the sun
Some MC's clash, some fall to the ground
Some stand and talk, and get severed apart
Smell of death, burnt flesh
Son, you get what you get when you mess with the Killa Bees nest
Invaders, real life hip-hop crusaders
Clash of the blade, Tomb Raiders, ya saviors
+Judgment Day+ is now, son, there's no more pretend (take money)
God's callin', stand tall, fight to the end


In The Ambush these thoughts are caput
In The Ambush y'all cats is Big Foots
In The Ambush you get your face mushed
In The Ambush these thoughts caput


Lyin' in the huddle, my team ready to Ambush
Maria's Child, youngest boy, ain't the one to be pushed
What? Do the knowledge to The Ambush
Flashin' my understandin', your style I stay romancin'
Blood like video games, unlock the base
All up in your face, like Papa Dukes talkin'
You must reveal, you never built nothin'
Shorty frontin' like you said somethin'
Never had a Remedy, blaze like Mark on Belly
The God Cappadonna helped me walk my dogs (Take money)
Tell respect, pay less, respect Catalog
It's fucked up, the nigga stay writin'
Solomon Childs, location Body Brighton


In The Ambush you get your face mushed (BLAP!)
In The Ambush these thoughts is Big Foots
Yo! In The Ambush get ya face mushed


I move crews like I'm pushin, you just cushion
And real petty, your mind can't hold it
It's too heavy, Rem-D slash Big Donna
Was all ready, tanks came in
My niggas'll keep aimin', assault the fake rappers
It be The Ambush, motorcyclist MC's can't ride with the Hill-billies
Fuck 'em, Pillage, deaf until we get off the stage
Run for the nine-one-one wishin'
Break a reign from the rainbow coalition
Popped off, Ambush, the graveyard shift
Niggas'll take it off, be the ambush
The whole Pillage is Big Foots, be The Ambush


In The Ambush, take money
In The Ambush, these thoughts are Big Foots
In The Ambush, in The Ambush, you get your face mushed
Take money, in The Ambush (Ambush)
These thoughts have been pushed
In the Ambush, y'all thoughts is caput
(Uh.. uh) You get your face mushed
In The Ambush (Hold money) Take money
(Take money.. money) In The Ambush
Remedy.. (uh) slash C-A-P
In The Ambush, Pillage (We live y'all)
In The Ambush, the whole Pillage is Big Foots
(Killa Bees, Don Don, Rem-D, Solomon Childs)
Be The Ambush, you get your face mushed
Be The Ambush, it be The Ambush
It be The Ambush..


But it all started with an ambush and it's gonna end with an ambush




Yeah... fire and brimstone, the anointing
Yo, straight up and down, black music, yo


The black ACG's on, Louis Vitton
Yo, I'm feeling quite right tonight, ya'll
Big Cappadon, still low in the cut, with the gold fronts on
Chilling out, ladies loving, my socks bugging me out
I'm on a paper chase, stay fly
Henny to waste, pistol on the waist
I ain't trying to catch another case
Up on the tour bus, Theodore Unit
Entrepreneur status, the big baddest, family matters
Weed blowing, listening to Gladys
Soul babies with the 18 karat, solid gold rings
Smash BB Kings, annihilate clubs out of state
Cappachino the Great, my nigga Ghostface, we stay laced
Bubble letters with the rugby hats, we were the thugs be at
Clubs react, niggas wanna be us
We g'd up, back on the block, re'd up
Chicks talking, wilding niggas walking, tell ya story walking
Take caution, I got the flow sick, put dough on the hits
Snows all over the bricks, got hoes all over my shit
Stand back, while I blow this bitch
Every day, my whole dress code switch
Don Diggeler, top of the line
Certified rhyme buster one time, milk this cow
The best way I know how, raising a mild child
Original O.G., beats could never hold me
Laid back, just aligner, what me and my Co-D
The ice cold O.E., my name is tattered on your H.O.E
Labels could never control me
Goldielocks stay creepin' with the cold ass heat
Diggler...




Did you feel the wind this time?
Did you see the moon light shine?
Cause the twilight seems near
But the light shines nowhere
Do you feel the cold wind's blow?
Did you see the darkening glow?
Cause the twilight seems near
But the light shines no where


She was amazing Carmela, caramel complexion
And God brought it into my life as a suggestion
We clicked, I liked mink, she liked iced out rings
The finer things in life, together we shared drinks
Vodka and cranberry, my little cherry
If I got locked, she would fill up my commisary
It was magic, I felt the bond between us
She was a jelly to my peanuts, Mars to Venus
The Earth to my sun, moon and stars, we added up
Mathematically, it's like I had a bad habit, B
She knew my lifestyle, chick of a crime boss
She would hide my guns in the house then lie to the task force
Finished my sentences, knew my exact frame of mind
Knew everything I had was hers and she was mine
We were crazy in love, couldn't get enough of each other
The center of attraction, we were made for one another


Nah, don't even fall for that Caucasoid
She got your drink laced trying to turn you into an android
She's not your peanut butter, more like a fucking nutcase
You all googly-eyed De Lucas mob watching your place
They pulling trains on her, beat and rape, cum in her face
They got the drop on you, son, you're a fucking disgrace
You think God sent her? Nah, it's the devil instead
They got plans for you, Tone, they want you dead, dead, dead
So get rid of that cherry pie pie, she mad poison
Tu carajo, they got to bring the boys in
Yeah, dun dun, DeLucas mob want your head on a platter
It don't matter, son, all your dreams is gonna shatter
They trying to get at ya, she got you caught in a rapture
Nigga, wake up, y'all aren't even made for one another
She a snake, Logan gone get you sprayed, brother
It's a set-up, seen it before, Doofie got wet up


Nah, you're paranoid, man, your mind getting the best of you
She would never set me up, or lace my drink
Watch how you're talking, you know I keep heat in the mink
You're dead wrong, confusing her with one of your hoes
She's a ride or die chick, believe me, a nigga knows
I'm the el capitan, put this whole squad together
Keep talking bro, I'll put one in your leather
Ballcap, Logan'll do the hit, now that's better


Ah, man, come on, Tone
You sleepy eyes, man
I told you before, son, yo
You gotta stay focused out there look
Look out the window, man
DeLucas mob, son, you know who they are
Them same motherfuckas, yo, I've seen her with the niggas before
She's a set-up chick




Well now I dont mean to be dippin into yalls business
But Ive been listening to you dudes talk about womens
And I wanna run down a little somethin to you


Yeah, this my angel right here

Avalanche gets busy the lyrics is right
Avalanche is handsome the mirror is right
I shine on niggas like I mirror the light
Veteran of war cause I'm aware of the fight
You niggas homosexual you wearing them tights
Avalanche jesus peace the diamonds to bight
Thirty eight snub nose what ever you like
Yoeee I saw you riding your bike
Yoee you need more than a knife
Yoee better head to the light
Yoee so I heard you wanna fight
You an industry hoe that means your bitch is a dyke
Battle on king of the dot maybe I might
My metaphors in your raps like Tyson you bite
Lift you off the ground like you flying a kite
G never fucks pussy he's lying on pipe
Never said I'd harm your daughter i'm lying you right
I wanna braaawwwl I'm dying to fight
Your not ready to die for a mic
On you tube you'd die for a like

Bitch you ain't got nothing on the rich every other day my whole dress code switch

Not a problem to put a mill on your block
Coroner van with their hand on the chalk
Ain't talking birds when you handle the cock
I'll take it to your fame I'll put my hands on your pops
This is where the hand ringing will stop
Wear gloves when I put that thing in the Glock
Quarter mill whip that I bring in the shop
The gas money will get this bitch shot
Block huggers twelve guage and them nickle tuckers
New jack cocaine chris tucker
I'll get you burbon or Turkish delight
Green corn like the amish will like

Pandemic bin laden green clovers
Half a ton of trauma in the green rover
Masseratti introduced me to the stew maker
Body blow impact like shoe maker
Levy nine I walk the street with heavy nine
Yoeeeee talks shit but runs every time
I'm like a jew who drops change I pick up every dime
I have got a quotable in every line



Intro: Cappadonna
This album right here
This is the Yin and the Yang
So you gonna hear a lot of different things on it
You gonna hear a lot of profanity
You might hear a lot of um...
A lot of love
A lot of hate
You know what I'm saying?
Cus it's like come on I got enemies
I got frienemies
And those that pretend to be's

HOMOCIDE HILLS!
That's the grits
THE GRITS!
The barracks baby word up
Verrazano bridge
Yo yo


I give a speech like Martin Luther King
Let freedom ring
Forget a bow ring
It's a black thing
Holding me locked up
With brothers be getting oxed up
Taking life for granted
Most of us abandon
How I know you not a cruel
Beef in the home
Africans
With jet black Americans
Dominicans war with the Puerto Ricans
Deep in the street
Thugs carrying heat
The rest of the projects surrounded with gates
Middle class families are moving upstate
While the younger generation selling cake
Trying to immitate mixtapes
It's all final
Big locks on the Verrazano
Get fined BB conduct
On some King Tut
Poverty struck
I seen the right to enter Uhaah took
My cup runneth over
Stressed out whenever I'm sober
This cold world got my girl scan
Fight on the sand
I'm allergic to ham
Weak minds all aboard
I see devils in the eyes of camcord'
And my reward is to let y'all know
I'm going out like PLO
Whenever I go uhh

THE GRITS!
THE GRITS!


I start the slaughtering
Make all eyes start watering
I know an 800 number you can get your coffin
Start ordering
The metamorphosis of my skill is sure to bring overcome any king
Faking ain't counterfeit
Money in the bing
I do a sting with two 9's under my sling
Anybody you bring
Still won't do a god damn thing
You nothing but a...
Onion in the rain
I floss rhymes
I loss rhymes
I got it like that
Y'all bitch niggas I toss times
I got rhymes that'll still rock you
Cats that'll spot you
Told you I chill
Lay off a shit
I still shot you
The only thing I'm unable to do
Is do what I got to
Look in hospital
Brooklyn apostle
Lyrical gospel
Still fortunate to scorch your shit
Paying for the cost of it
Your whole style remains wack
I know It's awful kid

THE GRITS!
THE GRITS!
THE GRITS!
THE GRITS!


I play the back like back in the days
Give thanks and praise
Watch the frisk raise
Reunite
Take birth trees to upright
I forget a fake MC's
My songs the Bible
Survival in the man
The lost lands
No radio play
The Pillage is banned
Like a foreigner don't understand
Y'all some flan cats eat pig
Reneg real shit from digs
Hit you off with the packages
And facts on tracks
Y'all talk but that's put that back
We dealing in the orphanage
Way surpass your image
I'm a chemist
A dual dentist
Treat my heritage like friendship
I be exit
I rock a gold necklace
And restless
It's always hectic
Staten Island shit
Bad habit shit
Made me twist it
One twenty disctrict shit
Pillage be the senate
Throw darts like Masons
Garment Rennaissance
Patrionts
Hold the blood like tampons
Baby conduct
Put your fist up
No more struggles
100 dollars for the hen' dog
200 for the bubbles
Less troubles
Pill-Age
Plus some can turn rappers of off the stage
This beef will never we engage
Buck buck buck buck buck

THE GRITS!
THE GRITS!
THE GRITS!
THE GRITS!
THE GRITS!


If you fucked my little ho
Yo, let me know that then(Exactly)
Let me know cus I definately let niggas know
When I was banging they ho up
I was like yeah yeah
You thought she was in love with you and I tried to tell you that
She wasn't in love with you and I blazed her
Then I called you
The next day and let you know
And you gonna be like
'Yo, let me get my bracelet back'





Crooked I, you niggas know my name
Slaughterhouse C-O-B you niggas know my gang
I'm just a rider on them tracks like I'm on a train
My raps take away my hurt, the flow is novacaine
Get rid of the drummer when I'm in the booth
Or I'ma go insane
Cause my reciting is like the Irish fighting in Notre Dame
Pain. Disrespect me on my soil my shooters are loyal
Cause I rap on a beef like aluminum foil
You cryin' over spilled milk
Whatchu you doin' to spoil
Your bitch suck a king dick, she assumin' I'm royal
Yeah I'm American's realest son
On some alien shit, my new name is Area 51
Oh, God of California I'm out the West
Slaughterhouse got this industry on house arrest
I fucks with M-Eighty
I'm signed to Slim Shady
My flow change shit, think baby, shit crazy

Yeah, the Almighty rapper
Citing, rapping up your Aphrodites
It'll take more than a couple M's to pacify me
My cheese is dirty
I need the industry to pasteurize it
Pay off my taxes with direct deposits
Fly as it gets spill signs just as as high as it gets
To leave a loud mouth quiet as shit
Fuckin' amazing the way that Planet Asia
Leaves abrasions on the jack light
Prison inmates in state cages
The art of  slang
My gold chain language is slick
My soldiers on the battlefield with the proper training
For those who hate the game
I got something to make you to stop complaining
Ain't no stoppin me from chopper aimin'
Rocker bangin' on the block for danger
Find me with the OG's
Breakin up OZ's and chop the game up
High sidin'  hustlin' til the summer's up
On the grills just tryin' to keep the numbers up





I'm only 30 years old
But they're calling it 40
Besides myself I only like to be with my shorty
I'm a bum fly leadin' with my homies and them
Chillin' in a fly BM
Everybody in the hood know I'm buggin' ill
But I'm always in the spot where the thugs is real

Though my shit backed up for anyone who act up
Killa Beez in the house
Enemies get clapped up
No gimmick no punch lines, nothing to laugh at
Hip hop Adidas and Lees
Bring grab bag
All the shit that sound garbage you can trash that
Red posse is smashed at
Killa Bee murderin' tracks
About 60  Hillary
Yeah nigga fuck whoever not feelin' me





I feel like I should plan to move to another planet
When I'm gettin it in
Since I'm surrounded by human manikins
Unable to mentally process messages
I'm establishing embarrassin' how the talent level just keeps unravellin'
Diminishin' to the point I'm listening to excrement
While my pen is intent on challengin' the Old Testament
Me and Crooked I on collabos like blood brothers
Have artists wishing their fathers never met their mothers
Smoke a nigga like 300 cigarette cartons
Never ignorant stayin' ripped like 200 Spartans
Warrants up to my earlobes
I smear globes with your hemoglobin
My feet are cloven like weirdos
Without fear wasn't raised foolish
I'm humble yet fully aware
I'm your influence's influence 
When I spit it's an amazing affair, I'm so rare
If I were steak I'd still be grazing somewhere






Come on! Yeah... yeah..
Yo, yo


Wu-Tang, we always in the Spot Lite
Get paper, every night is hot night
We stay tight, we just livin' our life
We just livin' our life


I drink till I'm drunk, smoke skunk with my stinkin ass, smell the funk
Eekin out the pours, cum stain, shitty drawers
Pissin' down ya elevators shaft, no class, writin graf' on ya walls
It be us, fuck ya law, nigga, my cause is "because"
No yin to my yang, it's a black thing
Used to be in chains, now we snatch chains
Took the crack game applied it to the rap game, y'all
Pop quiz, now, what artist hits the hardest?
Get down with the syndrome: retarded
I think it was them swordsmen, place ya chess pieces on the boards and
Take it to square, this ain't no Yacub affair
Or a New World Disorder, got us, fuckin the coal miner's daughter
That y'all, but not us
Fly back, flag a cab and say "check ya"
Next time you see me, say peace and I'll respect ya, Tical




Yo, lights, cameras, don't forget the action
The needle skip, but the turntable scratchin'
Chain blow, bangles, heavy on the cashin'
Same old, Range rove', rainbow Manhattan
Craftmen, captive, still I'm avalanchin'
Holy war, handsome, break 'em off harassin'
Latest fashion, passion, bullets reign gashin'
Flippin' through frenzy, the same Wu-Tang
The Hollywood frame, purple haze stain
Rules of dame, fools, choose to bang
Nigga, you lose, Wu, bruise the game
A few men came, that really held weight
Drop, Chinese bars, stars in fifty-two states
Like, bats out of hell, we crash the gates
Without a base, left the gun powder case
Ladies chase, the hip-hop Babyface




Word up, throw your hands in the air, like you just don't care
Wu-Tang in your atmosphere, everybody say "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"


Mic Capone, it's best to avoid my strike zone
I zone and swing a sword that'll slice stone
Nice clone, but you could never match the born master
Who tore back half the world, and still saught after by
Dick ridin' niggas, and chicks who do ditto
Singin' like the Four Tops, providin' info
See me low, through the Jeep window, the chrome spins slow
Gene-ral on the J.O., survival M.O
For now get wild, similar to Ol' Dirty
A third time felon just hit with over thirty
Note worthy style, have them so thirsty
First degree heat, you quittin' on me
Cold turkey, no mercy




Wu-Tang, put you in the Cobra Clutch, til you give up
Ya'll can live up to, Witty Unpredictable
Street mentality, return of the cavalry
36 Chambers, we off key block
Black on the block, tell ya D.J.'s to quit
M.C.'s, to stop that bullshit
Me, Ghost and Rae, we known to pull shit
Step with the brick, on some Ice Water shit
Wallo's in all colors (now) let's get chips, like
Robbin' the bank, pull up with the new whips
Don't get mad, respect rank
No matter how you gettin' dough, give thanks
Everybody hold up your shanks






Let's mosey. (Yeah, Yo)


See me son, I'm secular rap, I'm second to none
They call me 3rd Diglah, Respect me dun
It's been a long time coming but I'm here now
Make way I got no time for your funny style
Fake ways, Jake prey on us but we duck down, Stay low
Gats don't sit in the pocket money, Cause they blow
Aaaa-Ohh, Who got a problem with mouth and they go
Keep talking rip you apart, Like you was Legos
I tangle for the cash my flash is something furious
Yea-Yo is the path, I get cash for rapping serious
Stay low with the crabs while my swag keep cabbies curious
I'm smacking on these fags and the game envy is serious
Me and my camp low, Move out like a stamp go
All around the World and I-yi-yi-yi, I spit that gat flow


Nobody never told you how I be the building
And burning piff with my niggas and a couple of children
Getting gwap, Tryna stack my cheese, Nigga please
This is fairy boat Lo, That be shooting the breeze
You know my O-U-T fit nice on, My boys they whyle out
And blam when they lifting they right arm
All up in the ghetto in night bombs, I right wrongs
I'm House Gang just like an urban icon
Catch me on a bus with my chain and my ice on
I'm looking real yes like I'm getting my fight on
I'm nine-eleven, Who be throwing them pipe bombs
A nigga from the Stat that be making his rights wrong
You know the kid hard, Never do light songs
I roll with the Stones but on the road them white cons
Lingerer zoo part two with a nice blonde
Fuck around say something, You end up your life's gone


New York City, Power-ffinalia
We come through where the feds'll tell ya
We the largest rap group that ever lived
Shaolin for the kids
Round house, Black belts, And beards
Verrazano Bridge talk, Moon walk
Thrity-six clips of hard shit, Hard bricks
New York City and Shaolin, Niggas'll get hit with hard licks
Throw your towel in, Five niggas whyle'n
Nigga we keep on style'n, Cut em up into a half a gallon
More money, More murder, It's the beat swerver
Diglah with the fly handle, I break beats down and I dismantle
Anyone of yall niggas'll get shot, My mic is the Glock
Words'll pop in your head like various speed knots
Come on with it, Come on get it, Long did-ick
Cappadon of the fat outfits, crazy fitted
Straight Park Hill, Bark is ill, Sparkling grill
Niggas with the hood shit, Taste the skill
Shaolin slash Wu-Tang, Darts'll bang
Never forget where you come from, Respect my game


Yo let's move, We gotta be out, one




Push the panic button, pull the plug nickel
Any rapper laughs about us make a thug giggle
Take a pick, pretty oenny shine swiftly
Spit it in a minute until the piggybank's empty
Atlanta need a title, let's call Mark Rifkey
Underground king like Pimp C
If I'm wrong, convince me
I'm considered a first in twenty entries
High on living life so I don't need your sense
Many men popping pills, feeling sickly
Trying to battle me with a bull pin back committee
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, ti's easy to fall behind
Starey eyed, slap a hand cock on the dotted line
It's not a game, but we all got bits to play
The Price Is Right for Whose Line Is It Anyway?
Anyday is your time to shine pal
Everybody's waiting to find out, find out


We see beyond the rain
We might be gone today
Can't be too strong to change
Can't be too strong to change


Wide open, excelerator is pinned down
Devestate the champ, when I went the decision of ten rounds
Scratch out, we knock em out in a minute flat
Inify the pulse with a concentration of killing rap
Steal your heart and than give it back
Put some teeth in the love, sew it up with a big DUST gorilla track
Then Cappadonna got some fire to breathe
Slow burn desire push up your lighter to see
Manchild rep a power that is higher than me
Get right whenever I spit any night of the week
It's like freak to the rhythm, hit em right in the teeth
And bleed all the wisdom till it fights a disease
I got peace of assistance for the liers and thieves
Or give Christ the envision that I'm trying to be
When a strong sense of innocence silents the weak
And minds of the apostles still die in the streets
But the spirits gon shine till it's flying and free
Till the top of Mount Zion to the highest degree
I got peace of assistance for the liers and thieves
Or look at Chirst at the vision that I'm trying to be




What, yo I take over the land like the four ???
Put the hop in the game like Chi-Ali
Got flies on my face like Somolian kids
Pop off when I'm ready like I'm doing the bid
Straight ghetto in the slums where my peoples is
Turn to Cappadon, never too strong to change, I get it on
Cut em off at the corner, make me go long
Turn the beats up like ?Deja Rashawn?
Never wack when I enter, my game is tight
To the iron chmabers of death and you don't wanna fight
Diggila, keep darts under the fitter
Me and my dula Manchild, we like our style
Came back to the hood, how you like us now?
Got chicks on the regular, driving them wild
Changing the game on ya'll, keep a low profile
Holla back at the kid, we can take it to trial
Got God on our side and ya'll living foul








What y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
This '97
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to '79


I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultraviolet shine blind forensics
I inspect you, through the future see millennium
Killer Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets, Queen Bees ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block


As the world turns, I spread like germ
Bless the globe with the pestilence
The hard-headed never learn
This my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life standing firm
On foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
Transform into the Ghost Rider
A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire
Who got my back in the line of fire holding back?
What? My peoples if you with me, where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
What the blood clot? We smoke pot and blow spots
You want to think twice? I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums


I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
Vocabulary 'Donna talking, tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what? Run for your brother kid
Run for your team and your "six can't rhyme" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme, your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts, paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought
I got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God


The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang


Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape Hell globe spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anaesthesias
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings


March of the wooden soldiers, C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square we stay in gold like Flair
Escape from your dragon's lair
In particular my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat bass lines on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck, I'm ducking five-year probation


War of the masses, the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song


The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none


Yo Yo Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink, you had a Navy green
Salamander fiend, bitches overheard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cork-pop convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese, is that so?
Ceaser needs the greens, it's Earth
Ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz


Aiyo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer, Blue-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor world tranquilizer
Adjust the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening
Guaranteed made 'em jump like Rod Strickland






Weve just received a report that New York City is under attack by swarms of killer bees. Theyve been seen approaching from Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. We urge you to stay in your homes at this time, as we will be bringing you up-to-the-minute information. This just in: Police are reporting that theres a man on top of a skyscraper, ready to jump. Im told that he is possibly Ol Dirty, a member of the Wu-Tang Clan. The police suspect that there could be some connection between this old dirty man, and the killer bees

I'm on the ground floor hustling, but I'mma still score
I don't care what ya'll say, cuz I'm ready for more
Yo, these streets got my head, like never before
That's why my man Big Gator gotta carry the four
Even though we just looking for beats, they hating on us
Now, muthafucka, so we looking for beef
So we took it to the beast, and got a little deal
Might shut shit down, cuz it got a little real
Now we ready to live, and prepared to die
Yo, all we wanted was a piece of the pie
And a tall glass of milk, the brotherhood is real built
Using the knowledge, that God gave us
Yo, we got to save us, this time we took many falls
But we never gave up, yo I'm happy to be alive
And survive in dust, gave thought to suicide
Yo, it's still not enough, sniff coke
Had a lot of money and went broke, but times go hard
Yo, we tugging the rope, yeah, we tugging the rope
Yeah, we tug that rope, like we tugging the boat
Yeah, we tug that rope, like we tugging the boat
Never forgetting where I come from, I love my folks
We ghetto, like the rest of ya'll, got dreams and hopes
I'm in the valley with you, straight slumming
We got to spit when the swat come in, yeah load up our shit
Watch out, yeah the roads is slit, the flows is thick
It's real out here, yo, the colds is brick
And it's too many fights, up all night
Can't wait for tomorrow to come, we live with the gun
And when the clouds part, there go the sun, we are all one
As the Earth spun, niggas got murdered and hurt
Some, and when the dirt come, it's worth done
Tight skirt holding the young
I'm on the come-up, Q-Dini, beating the slums up
We never gonna quit, til the ones is up
Give me the broc', I like money like the rest of ya'll
Now give me the rock, I'mma shine when it's my time, give me a spot
Yo, whoever can't cope, yo, tug on the rope, yeah, tugging the rope

Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention

Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga

Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup


Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real


How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, "Accept yourself"
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?


If there's hell below. I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoyin' yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us




Crazy shit
Riding on the side of my horse
Desperado style



Killers for life, ain't no hope
Police in the building, yeah we never shook
Hard genes make a nigga feel like a rugged look
Acid, E pills, Molly and  food
The young could have taken a little time to give a push
The homies that's rapping, mine is a weapon
Get it on the streets, you don't have to be at the sessions
Pop your wardrobe, came got a crib near the Mexicans
Were back in New York, me and Amar be on Lexington
ID's good if the police try to flex again
Cant stop us
We only in the hood when we pop up
Chop chop up packages, show'em rough
 he's black down, black truck
Black niggas, pro-black as the fuck
Africa shit keep white
Nobody move,nobody get bust
Nobody in the building
And nobody getting shot


In this shit there has been a slight change of plans
Cause y'all niggas never really stood a chance
And this year watch me do'em for the fans
Do it for the kids Im like DJ Lance
Rock, sometimes life is topsy-turvy
Me, I'm tryna get it early
As long as fiends snorting 
Imma grab the world in a short curlies
My M.O. is to get this dope
So I need blow like the drip of snow
Okay, I need hoes I can touch they toes
Im grilled like Michael Jacksons first nose
Yeah, niggas in the hood say Im on fire
Nigga Im in the hood like carbon fiber
She can be talking the Aston Martin
I still give her the boot, Doc Martens


We design, find and restore energy
We define our time through our melodies
Nah I aint trying to hear the shit these niggas telling me
Listen to this industry
Niggas out with this celery. no flavor
Watch a game like the nosey neighbor watch
Understand how they do surround sound 
Just to make your things move about like modern kings
Everybody knows about the sagas that my niggas sing
See the rapid singing, more than all my jaw
All my  better leave their business card
You ain't got one man, you ain't about shit
This is a new day, dawg
We figured it out New age program
Money makes no 
No physical effort, work for no man
See we enterprising nigga, this is just us
And if you ain't there, well then nigga this is tough luck




You heard other raps before, but kept waitin'
A lot of niggas is hatin', these hoes is like Satan
I'm still debatin' whether I should build or destroy
What the Earth keep on shakin'
I'mma keep on makin'
Hit after hit be comin' out of the basement
There's no replacement from a slew of great men
I'm about to break in
Damage every snake and Gin, you can't win
I'm the truth, you a fake friend
Realness against falsehood, do it again
Get money, work hard, don't become a victim
Mind your own sick wisdom
Study math, get your friend some
Never quit 'till you get done
God over fiction, this is my addiction
Anytime, homie, I'm about to spit somethin'
Traded crack for rap, and I'm a rich sucka
J3 murderous tracks, all day, facts
Through your mind, body and soul
Let it be told I ain't nothin' to play around with
Baby, I get down quick
Ebony chicks love me for my heavenly kiss
I do it for the bricks, I let it off like a piss


Send in the stunt doubles
I have no time for the petty, little power struggles
No time to tussle
I epitomize the hustle, the struggle of the underground
Cynics and critics, I shut 'em up and shut 'em down
Schemin' and plottin', yet I keep 'em so aroused
When I come around
They say it's business, never personal
Balance the scale, tell me what's the worse of the two?
This industry's unjust and corrupt
Huskey cut for a couple of bucks and a few busted nuts
Yet they keep insistin' in God they trust
It's blasphemous, let the church say "amen"
Keep repentin' your sins
Say a few Hail Mary's, turn around, and do it all again
Livin' a lie, he just tryin' to win, tryin' to win


Yeah, they call me the black  boy, boy
No, it's not a game, not playin' with no toys
Epitome of bangin', his set make no noise
My set sanctuary, you faggots folklore
A urban legend, a Mac is a blowtorch
Runnin' down the line, pack slammers of all sorts
Trappin' from the green, help fortin' the back porch
Let's take him to the building to get these packs off
In war with the system that be lettin' these raps walk
Turn 'em into victims so the witnesses back off
The V82, better tell 'em that crack course
The view of the bully, better go tell 'em ask boss
A five time felon, get your kufi slapped off
Look, got 'em shook, this a doobie rap, dawg
A five time felon, get your kufi slapped off
Look, got 'em shook, this a doobie rap, dawg


Higher than ever before, tryin' these weapons I bought
Iron respectin' for all, I'm straight checkin' your hog
Without collectin' your charts, beatings with seconds apart
We dissectin' the vault while they be testin' the hog
No instrument, so-called 
No cold incidents, no more 
Po-po pinchin' us, inchin' us over the edge
Ship us over to FEDs, stiffin' over the breads
S.O.S., that shit's beef
Turn  and miss me
Turn 6 days into 6 weeks plus into 6 years
All that liquor and triggers turn into cold D's and OG's that sip beer
Timin' a vic here, the climate is cold enough
And I'mma throw it up if she drivin' the pole up
Survivin' from growin' up and livin' off robberies
So if you don't do the math then you learn trickonometry




Excuse me over there, with the high heel shoes
You looking real good, you got me in the mood
I'm trying to be nice, not trying to be rude
You could ask anybody, I'm a hell of a dude
But anyway, baby, I love your skirt
We can exchange numbers, that won't hurt
I'm from the hood, but I don't hang around with dirt
You might see me on a Sunday, going to church
Come on girl


You're the kind of girl, I've been looking for
I don't think I have to look anymore
Walk with me, talk with me


Look baby, all I really see is a queen
Don't walk away from me and be all mean
Like one of those chicks with low self esteem
Too much drama, smoke all that green
I used to be the move, but I'm older now
Attracted to a woman with a certain style
And you look like, something that could meet my Earth
For real though, something tell me this could work
Come on girl




My love, you're like a dime that I saw in a vision
I stopped you, baby, I'm a good decision
Walk with me, learn how my ways are humble
Anybody mess with you, I'm ready to rumble
I peep love in your aura, mine's a match
A lot of dudes hurt you before, but they ain't Cap
However you lost, love, I'mma bring you back
I'm telling you, Don where the love is that
Walk with me, come on girl




Walk with me, talk with me
Walk with me, talk with me
Walk with me, talk with me
Walk with me, talk with me




Remix (Cappadonna, KMC, Wu-Tang, wanted down in Jamaica)
Wu-Tang, here it is


Pass me clothes, jump on a beewee
Playing on my guard, on the yard
And the caddy bout it, front of me
Want twenty five dollars, I'm robbed
But I'm rich, bout the Trinidad, ya'll can look on
Me want my movement on the art
Jamaican pool, is all up me up
Physician me want bumbaclot, know


I'm wanted (wanted) wanted (wanted)
Wanted in Jamaica


I'm wanted for a crime that I didn't commit
Wu-Tang Clan, we never submit
Throw away the guns, empty the clips
It just like Jamaica, down in the Bricks
Gun man move, we don't take no shit
New kind of gun, we exercise it
Snake like a silent ninja, get cash
Go hard, pull heat for the legal tender
Bad boy movement, never surrender
Police go wild, whenever we enter
We in here like power guard center
Cappadonna, KMC
Swiss vans up, duck the po-e
In Jamaica, keep it low d
Feds come around, tell 'em you don't know me
You don't know me, you don't know me




You says I pull on the boy, them throw 'em my up
Get the gun, blood fire, from all the bluff
All the killy killy boy, them come bumbaclot
Beenie Man, gon ponder de bumbaclot
As KMC, said he want bumbaclot
Police want to lock me up for bumbaclot
Said me all up in the jets at the bumbaclot
Boy, I cuff me on lock, boy
Beenie Man, you coulda tell me
Bounty Killer could of warned me
Weed mash, oh boy, you could of showed me
I would of never disrespect the country
Look after me, come off the stage
The whole media going in a rage
Police want me, locked up in a cage
Know me, I be in a new page




Yeah, man, Cappadonna, KMC
Wanted, in Jamaica, Wu-Tang Clan
Killa Beez on the swarm
This is how we do it, we mix it up to get it popping
Police not catch us, wanted in America, want




Less seen and less heard, It's the pillage
Live where we die for trade, orphans of the industry, rise up against
Pretense, DJ's of segregation come together plottin' on the Nation
Cats got the puff powder dance
Underground economics, take a chance at the crackpot
Speak at the ones on top
At the gay bar your best rap star caught not keepin' it real
Whats the deal wit' ya'll wanna be MC's when Ghost hit you
The struggle is official with this
Chill cause we don't mix wit' yall uncle Tomers
We rock those real black leather bombers
For real, Park Hill not Beverly Hills
Ya'll better be still
My brains come out of my ball pen for my origin
I put the work in, any predictament
In fact it don't matter to me
The rap Oprah Winfrey with less currency
But rock beautifully, no security with me
Hard times and prophecy
One idea, two children and three for virginity
Pure energy whenever you confront me
I'mma take yours, star wars


Star Wars, storm troopers, evil rulers
New manuevers, Black German Luger laser beam

(repeat Chorus)


The tables turned now, enter Shaolin where it's cold now
Let the Teck blow now
More Jungle nails, Parkhillbillies pour gas on Phillies
Blocks where the Babies pick locks
And Women make love to other Women
It's the pillage, your Mother's Sons
No more cold war, it be the poor ones
No radio play, from the hallway to the doorway
They banned us, cease to understand us
Rap criminals segregated, player hated
Underrated, project recipients
Cappadonna, bag with the marijuana
I'm a late-comer, I spread love last Summer
Photographs with the Hummer
A young dumber, bound to get dumber
I speak the real CB, pillage monopoly
Talk a XYZ, ain't nothin' like WB
O.T.F., a bag of Uno Sixty
I love how the weed get me
See me whole style tricky
Gats under the table, the tables turn now
Life is too short and too foul
Fake Brothers will get exiled
Staten Island style, chicka-Pow!

 - 2X


I drop paragraphs of information
My mind starts racin'
I'm in the lot dancin' with the hard-headed
I start to attack on every track when I react
Dancehall style, ain't nothin' nice
I came to regulate, Cappachino the great
Comin' from all sorts of angles
I close in, my team be the chosen
Authorized like a hat tucked in
You get sucked in, catch a repurcussion and crushed in
Paralyzed, open your eyes, it's us again
O.T.F. hit you like the blow of death
Pulled while you was 'sleep
With or without the gold teeth
Crunch and lounge, Q guardin' the door
It's like Comstock, we in the Belly similar to clock
Boys to Men buildin', in the street
Oatmeal and Cream of Wheat
Thugs smoke leek, it's like the penile in the ghetto
Palmetto, chocolate trees, crying Babies
Rabies to the ringworm, take a turn and get burned
Tryin' to be this, realness
Shaolin barracks is very high tempered
Sensed it in the water sorrounded by the fairy boats
Hallways with pissy cut throats
We forever live, gotta protect the orphanage
The beast men, learn to fight back with the poilcemen
Star Wars...Star Wars

The Flying Dutchman
Ay, 'tis the phantom ship that forebodes doom


Yeah, motherfuckers, Flying Dutchmen
Lex Starwind, Jon Murdock, Cappadonna, the don of mic
Helium flash, star mode, apparent brightness, motherfucker
Ha, we shine brighter


You fucking with the hand of God, destruction's right arm
Flying Dutchmen, pressurize, we brew a slight storm
48 volt power inversion, turn this mic on
Get your HD cameras, Canons and Nikons
Televise tellin' lies, tell the truth
Till there's demons telling lies to the youth
Did the wolves in the den got his eyes on the coupe?
Did the troops and the Feds got they eyes over you?
Demonize for the proof
Black magic, acid rain dance, FIFA dream trance
Continental wing to wing feather span, the enhanced
Biometric, through the fire wire, pyrotechnic
The way the God sound through the mic when projected
Well protected method, Vanderslice craft perfected
Sound waves contract, expand, enhance when reflected
The audio acoustic substance viscus elusive
Trained for years for this shit we producin'
Upper echelon pantheons what we standin' on
Compared to Fisher-Price soundtracks and them candy songs
I'm never right, but I can't be wrong
So how the fuck I'm s'posed to eat, feed my family, dog?
I'm straight hungry, concrete Congo iron monkey
Tryin' to see my problems thin when my pockets get chunky
Glock'll click, pockets rip, blocka hit lovely
Jump and flip, hop and skip, got to get money


Guard your face, force the ox, box unorthodox
I caught a shot, you faggots call the cops or you call your pops
No respect, fuck him too, we chase him down
Rip him out of his Cadillac, then mace the clown
Battle ax him, move like Action Jackson
Back smack him, hack him in his back, make him back spin
Your moms rush to his rescue? We smack her too
All because you rhyme wack just like Maganoo
We hate rappers that get promoted but can't spit
We rob rappers at they show for they bracelet
We run circles around your favorite rap star
And make him think, what the fuck he even rap for
'Cause many people, thinking they bigger than Vinny Diesel
Until they hear him spit once and say, "That kid is lethal"
But they'll never get signed to a major label
They're too hip-hop, commercial rap is what'll pay you
Let me tell you something, none of y'all can fuck with this
So you can scratch that right off your bucket list
You faggot weak sauce MCs could suck a dick
But you look gay, so you probably love this shit
I had a dream about fucking Shakira in front of a mirror
Sipping a beer with ice, no fucks, without a care in the world
Fuckin' it, suckin' it, huggin' it, rubbin' it, lovin' it
We on some other shit, hoverin' out of the mother ship
Drive and find you, Columbine you, silent nine you
If you can't find your God, then Jon'll find you


There's a right and a wrong way to love somebody
You gotta dead your enemies, burn them with the shotty
Never let the evil ones take away your spirit
Fire, have it burn them, smash them with the lyrics
Someone blocked your blessings, the righteous don't fear this
Jah keeping ya sane, stay unified
Mind detect mind, black Devils can't hide
Never date a harlot 'cause she never on your side
Can't trust the Pharisees, they based it upon lies
Befriend your friends, form alliance with your enemies
Jins come around, tryin' to suck up all your energies
Flying Dutchmen, we escaping all the penalties
Jon Murdock, Lex Starwind, dark ministries
Father Cappadonna, yeah, we move like centipedes
Never falling victim to the love and them hate degrees
Maintaining our status, Wu-Tang, what? Killa Bees




Yo, hold up, yo you know what..
S.I., Staten Island, niggas, yo, yo


Ain't no more talkin' money or fame
I'm stalkin' this game, and when I'm done
I'm stickin' the fork in this game and run clutchin' my gun
Name P.I., place S.I., N.Y.C
Caramel papi chulo, mammies vena que
Let's see if you could stop me
I beat it like a one man posse, I leave it wet and sloppy
I'm cocky, at times laid back, like to keep my fade back
A lot of niggas about to get paid back (HOOOOO!)
Because a lot cats that don't like me
I guess they thought I took it lighty
But I rhyme and make you niggas wanna fight me
I'll melt a nigga like a icey, and wipe 'em up with a towel
Still on the prowl, how bout? It's Staten Isle, I'm foul
The same time I got respect for what's real
Who said Staten Island niggas ain't real?
You dead wrong, and took you tied up with a red thong
For goin' against The Struggle
We squeeze on the team, crash your huddle


Well I'm known in the hood like Castellano
You could see me in the fiddy, puffin' H. Armano
Doin' eighty on the Belt', follow signs to Verrazano
I keep two guns in my hood like paisano
My style iller than ill, I'm sick like Alzheimer's
A bugged cat, ready to bring back old drama
If it wasn't for the Slash, what could I tell mamma
God damn, it's bad blood between brick and the mud (HOOOOO!)
Brick and the thugs, shittin' on love
Turned over on the newest, start spittin' the snub
My flow is nice and I ain't worried about them hoes at night
For my wife and seeds, gotta get this dough shit right
I'm analyzin', a look how the pro's get ripe
And number 16, yeah, I want it showin' the lights
I rep the hood, gotta respect the good
Even the ones that left the hood, bitch!


Car hard suits, Timb boots and millimeters
(We got this, we got this)
Hoes and fancy cars and smokin' reefers
Cellies and beepers (we got this)
Hoodies and sneakers (we got this)


Yo, it's the smoked out white boy back on the block
With the thirty eight snubbed nosed, tucked in his sock
From the H-Block, Huegonaut, part of the rock
Shaolin, Staten Isle, and I love hip hop
And when it comes to the kid, man, shit ain't easy
I Lounge with the Cappa D. and L.O. Beezy (I see you!)
You sees me? Yeah, yo, believes me
The Code:Red for life click, racoons need me
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, I got this
Rock this, radio drop this
The Code:Red's for real, yo, you can't stop this
None of ya'll muthafuckas out there could block this
Jumped in the whips, all dipped down low
Ready for a trip, to where, I don't know
No matter where we go, you can't stop the flow
The heat's on, gun's drawn, what's up, yo?


Aiyo, my spit never tasted good, I'm sour
I spit for the money and I spit for power
Then I lean on ya'll like the Eiffel Tower
And to my Staten Isle niggas, that's my heart
I might leave for a minute, but could never depart
Yeah, I'm married to this bitch and I'm still fuckin'
I'm in the hood where the guns is nothin'
And niggas don't say shit, like E.F. Hutton
Paranoid like Bush, press the button
Don't make me grab the boomers and get disgustin'
Poppy Wardrobe King, Code:Red Production
Pillage for life niggas, the hoes that's crushin'
To all my niggas that went out bustin'
Grindin', the black Timbs on, wild out, hustlin'
(We got this, we got this)






Yo
What up kid
2009 shit right here
Back out the bing son
Uh
Feels real nice
Let's do this (Spark it)
Yeah yeah
Woo


Yo
This pain ain't nothing I feel
Than what I felt when I was selling out
Out on the strip, crack dealt
The knocks rolled, chicks yelped, my momma said help
Judge hit me with a two-to-four
My life got shelfed
Back out the bing now, doing for self
My seeds want daddy back, that's why daddy pack
Baby mom screams like she's all that
Give her stacks she (?)
Like I sold drugs now I do rap
Hood rich, do rag
Too bad, you mad
Still my pen pop off
Two pass, my crew move (?)
Golden ass
Golden glass
Something could get stolen real fast
Niggas who be holding cash

Get bricks, get new kicks

Cut a nigga if he ever should snitch
Honeys, love 'em good and thick
We give 'em good stick

All the ladies in the house love the way we pop the nine
Step your hood up (step your hood up)
You in the hood, better step your hood up (step your hood up)
Step your hood up, you in the hood, better step your hood up
Brush your guns up, tie that hood up

Put the paint in the handle or rip the dutch
Mixed with the club life, we never gonna give it up
Suit it up, I know tricks in the hood that love to strip it up
Peace to all of my real hood niggas that never switch it up
Still lickin up, feel the fight and the pain like we don't give a fuck

And get contracts, go sell for sponsers
Show them how I ??? like Hotel Rwanda
A nigga hella proper and I'm nobody's property
The way I do my thang, I'm a hella comoddity
I gotta keep my habits, fast money and robbery
Well maybe not the other, cus the money is blocking me
Cus if I got locked I can't spread like containment chambers
But my music's needed like AIDS awareness
Stop what you're doing cus your aim is careless
You're pissing me off, I don't just aim to scare shit
I aim to bleed, I aim to please
So if the people don't like to your name is dead on the streets
Nigga you gets none like celibacy
And you ain't shit like weed with the stems and the seeds




You better have your a game on if you fucking with me
I'm unpredictable, most niggas can't call it with g
I got lyrics in abundance, crawling out of the dungeon
Lunging for the funds, when I'm done, you won't function
Catch me on the grind, if not, you won't see me
I'm surreal, you know the deal, my life is for the tv
Drug addicts addicted, fights right out my window
Fuck talk, I'm trying to raise my stock for my kinfolks
Victim of reality, scrambling to make a salary
Shit I deal with a fucking mentality
On daily basis, all the changing faces
I move once again, tired of changing places
Dog I'm ready to settle, but never for less
So every rapper I see got a target up on their chest
I call the out of style, buck the fuck wild
In this race to the finish, there's probably an extra mile




Yeah, Boss rap stupid
I'm telling you right now Staten Island man
Don't front on me, Yo


I grew up in Staten Island where the doors be locked
Crack dealers be at the building, The floors be hot
Yo Dreds be in the spot selling bags of meth
On a good day, You might see my homeboy Chef
Joelle, He turned rat now he's scared to death
Little kids still running round, Way after the dark
At the PF-57 near Policeman Park
In the back they found a new born stuffed in a bag
In the hood brothers die young it makes me sad
Ayo, I dropped out of school a high school Dad
Streets be eating up my brain like weed and hash
Taking trips up town hopping out of the cabs
Ridden calves from the Africans, Crashing em up
Putting dime into dollar bills smashing em up
Instead of passing our grade, We's passing the Dutch
Getting shipped away daily in them slavery trucks


Ayo what's really up, Ayo what's really up
Ayo what's really up, Ayo what's really up


In the hood it's only tough love and real tough thugs
Ayo I was the type of dude that didn't stay in the house
I was the type to while out and bring a tre in the house
And Momma Love used to tell me not to be like that
But I'll be gone for a week like I'll be right back
Staten Island, Yo, We can't stop the hustle
Ayo these thugs used to work for this kid named Muscle
Watch out for ply yeah, Cause that kid might bust you
Even though we hang tight yo we really don't trust you
Got brothers that'll shake your hand and then they'll cut you
But if your blood like me then the litter can't touch you
And it's the hood that got the world going insane
Even the suburbs, They know about the crack cocaine
It's the hood that drove brothers like Shorty insane
Ayo what's really up, Brother can't even maintain






Take two and hold that, I control that flow
The Wild West kid by the name of Crunch Lo
With my F.A.M. to the O, got mad styles fo' sho'
Huntin' for the dough, on our way we blaze ho's
You know's the routine, hold weight like three beams
Do it for them niggas that's locked in State Green
Hand-to-hand niggas that's out to make CREAM
Thugged out bitches not scared to serve fiends
It's the project hospitilities, enhanced abilities
To make it through this jungle of life, yo is you feelin' me?
From Barrack to Barrack, weed habits and big ratchets
Baggy jeans, big shines and hats on backwards
For all y'all cowards, get devoured in my sight
Bound to lose stripes if ya shit ain't tight
To the Capi-tan who devise the plan
If ya cross one of us then ya forced to hand
Of my heat holders, justifiable bulldozers
I told ya, got a few hundred to make ya run it


Eh-yo I spawned from the circle of life
I got special technique with the mic
We ultra-light sound sight
It's Beneen, rap extreme, we intervene
Through the mainline, flash ya cords, show time
For crime, 'merica's most divine rhyme terrorists
Studio darts, crash ya sound vocalist
Marble text, verbal intellects, broken tape decks
Two sets of cassettes, with rugged street dialect
Bionic, twelve stray bars of slang chronic
Break glass with the Armaretta, Scotch with tonic


We plan to make the world stop with this
Lockin' this, range long, flame on mic's
Minus the ice, non-theatric
Match this with wits, don't think sick
Don't sip, only dismiss ya battered attempts
And in the same breath you claim to represent nonsense
We back bombs, ya best respect threats, protect ya torso
With no remorse, verbal crossbows get let go
Leavin' ya frame touched, no stoppin' my daily cut
Wild niggas holdin' their buildings up, what will deliver us?
Livin' is terrible, prints illegible
Really they can't afford to come back
Pull it to raps, wraps raps in tracks
Wild Beneen on, peep the scene, strong, lean on
On ho's who choose to oppose, label the foes
Step on ya Lug covered toes, look how they rose
Dickin' ya farm, my niggas involved
Feelin' ya whole job, memory jog
With lyrical bombs, lyrical bars
What?


We whyla Beneenian, styla Beneenian
"We Wild Beneen on ya whole scene, whole team" -] Crunch Lo


The verse serial killa, real killa, plot dealers, smoke illa
Realest Fortune Wheelers, PaperMate, villians feel us
Strangle five-oh, gamble, time to pioneer
Leave studio in shambles, swing off the chandeleer
Stare down the barrel, narrow bow points with no trace
Based upon the facts, you'll change into a screwface
Move weight, my chronic laced, find a place
Private Session, microphone molestin'
Big boy with no Wesson
Gats the way to talk, gun-Tommy, break the sidewalk
Pager on short, crank my vision on to night hawk
Stalk Empire State, the verbal saturate, rape
Deserve breaks, from out-of-state, son, you're just a victim
Since the rhyme infliction, Othorized diction fiction


It's twelve bars a pass, my staff be Gun Ho
You know we tug boat on Wild Beneen kids with dumb flows
In a smash, then I crash, smoke grass and drink Dash
You know I think fast, creep, then I sneak in ya ass
With the kids from the Body and Jungle, Pillage and bumble
I rumble in so humble, in jelly tracks with the Cisco
It's real disco, and go and ask even Trisco
Been doin' this with peers since thirteen with Richie Fisco
But now I got squads and mobs and honor rods
Convoy with fifty cars, a hundred niggas with steel bars
Splash a nigga wig, for real, it's all Camille
On to Cheesy Rat, Othorized real, so what the deal?
Big guns take the streets in the summer
And little shorties runnin' wild, holdin' stacks and dealin' crack to the top runner
Who's in town, ain't nuttin' changed from the get-down
The same shit now, I called my Barracks up in mid-town
You know the one that shine that want to antagonize faggot ones
Drop dead maggot one, West Barrack twenty-one
Cherry heads to Paris, want some? So come and taste mine
We erased from danger, ya hold face and skip the gates mine
I Wild Beneen on ya whole scene, whole scene
And rest in peace to my whole team, whole team


Whyla Beneeni, styla Beneeni

I won't surrender, no I won't never ever forget
It's real in the Hill, times is bad like credit
Fuck what you heard, kid, I don't wanna splurge
I be tryin' to merge, and live life, outside of the picture
One time for ya mind, plus two times, I be comin' back to get'cha
Nevertheless, fuck the rest of y'all, I got the vest for y'all
Still the best for y'all, come one, come all
I flood y'all out, my welcome is war out
At the crossroads, 'Donna must come tear and explode
Out of your zip code, fuck a chart, see me lampin' on heart
I'm electric, my level is way beyond generic
Deep in you like spirit, these Barracks become epic
Three ways deeper than regular contraceptive





 + (samples)
(Make me yours) He get out of line, break his fucking arm...
You know how it go (What am I supposed to say? Yeeaaah)
You know, word up, not playing the games, with these niggas, man
(Somebody tell me what do I do...)
None at all, man... hit 'em off, none of that, man


Aiyo, jump out the Acura, crazy heavy, what's popping?
Us locking the game, word to every hand on the locman
Street gwop, everybody eats, sweep blocks
This is a message, ain't go no grams, we gon' beatbox
Study like lessons, niggas in the game biting the grain
You knowing where it came from, stop it
You thought we wasn't coming? You dumbing, you blunted again
Watch Lex get that dough out ya pocket, rhyme all 'pallegic
Can't nothing move when I rhyme, when I drop lines it's law out in Egypt
Love ups, don't need no batteries now, what?
The only niggas that'll glow'll be us
Yo, throw me in Sin City, leave me with the vultures and bats
Then give me two weeks to bubble like Kim titties
Dirt Dog, we miss you, now it's time to murder the game
Cuz if things change, you know it ain't against Wu


What am I supposed to say? Yeeaaah
Somebody tell me what do I do...


We keep it hot, keep the heat on the block
We never stop, drawing water up until it begin to drop
Raining with the patchwork of puzzles
That was written in the year of the dragon
More raw than you could ever imagine
How much of a great blessing to a rap city
Where the youth is organically fed, from the Witty
Unpredictable, Talent And Natural Game is lyrical
Analyze the picture, the portrait, the visual
A Cuban Link Chef cooks spaghetti that's untied
RAGU nigga whose tomatoes are sundried
He gave y'all niggas whiplash from bling bling
But my rhyme'll give ya hot flash and moodswings
Math shed light on divine secrets, then science leaked it
For the lower level creatures that can't peep it
I observe MC's, regardless
From a neighboring world which is ten times the sharpness...




Let the track wind and ya mind flow free
Remain conscious on this ride to ya best ability
Infinity, back to the source of which it came
Energy, see it change forms, atoms being born, never ending
On and on and on and, travel with me
Not trying to convince the pack, that it's a fact
For those who can't adapt, I lived it, shitted it back
We have agreed, you'll feel the impact of the truth when I'll squeeze
The brain feels something pop, hip hop, locked in texts
Fat checks, fly whips, jewelry, chicks
Enough kicks, fitted crown, buttoned down
Underneath the white T lies the four pound
This is forty-five minutes of menacing
Dismantling, any MC opponent stepping in the zone
Get ya face blown (Get ya face blown)




Observe the word, when I speak, get the truth's heard
True to the curb, Wu classic is the new birth
Spreading the blessing across seven continents
Arm of the trench, there's no form of defense
Entertainment, nine swords swing rapid
Check the techniques, first bow to The Abbott
Witty Unpredictable, gritty individual
Valid, if it's Actual, Talent and it's Natural
Game, rugged like the train, pump it in ya vein
I and I ride or die under the name
W-U, the primary, ya secondary
Definitely not necessary, the legendary
You printed the blueprints to do this shit
Moving the youth in the bricks
Spit poison tipped darts that rip hearts
Through the chest, when I manifest my sick art


Speaking my mind, fall in line when I spit mine
Still in my prime, still'll shine til it quit time
If this is a crime, find me guilty, I'm so sublime
So rapid with rhymes, sayin' I'm slacking is assonine
Revealing the truth, catching feelings, it's still the Wu
Gorilla the booth, body armored, them killa proof
In living proof, I'm the Wittiest Unpredictable
Most Talented rap muthafucker you ever listened to


I'm a hustler, I grind til my pack is done
Give a seed mad knowledge til they crack and run
Can't nobody fuck with me, I'm just too nice
Smack niggas in they head everytime I write
Yo, I'm straight from Park Hill where the guns is popping
Where them little black kids do they grocery shopping
Go to school fucked up, it's Africa Island
We poor in the bricks but inside it's nothing but talent




It's on 
(RZArector)


Yes the shit is raw coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, "Wu-Tang's back for more"
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)


This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
X Y  slam Nine Diagram pole
Raekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback Notre Dame
Golden Arms is bronze Buddha palm hit Qu'ran
It blows extreme, mainstream be the theme, supreme team
America's Cream Team, redeemed
Vidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone
Gun POW to the dome and split the bone
Wig blown off the ledge by the alleged
Full-fledged, sledge RZA edge
One dose of my feroc' handheld trigger cuts
A capella spitting shell paralyse if you get touched
And critical mic cords, hanging like umbilical
Cords, dope swords, five star general
Raw be the quote rap style sore throat
Through the fully operational, handheld totem




A hundred thousand times one, snatch up my styles get done
I hold a title, and here's how my belt was won, check it
Slick majestic, broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew through lack of effort
You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes
My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
Masked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords
And his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines
With more gains than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains
Poisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this
You get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this
Side effects of hot raps and hot tracks
A duffel bag full of guns son, dipped in black
My culture, glides and attacks you like a vulture
Ghostface in Madison Square is on your poster




Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy show it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
Of the Wu and learnt how to
Fuck up your anatomy steadily, calm and deadly
Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit
MCs submit to the will as I kill your
Juvenile freestyle, civilize the mental
Devils worship this like an icon
Bear-hugging mics with the grips of a python




You heard other raps before but kept waiting
For the Son of Song, I keep dancehalls strong
Beats never worthy of my cause, I prolong
Extravaganza, time sits still
No propaganda, be wary of the skill
As I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum
Dedicated to rap nigga, beware of the fearsome
Lebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat
CD massacre, murder to cassette
I blow the shop up, you ain't seen nothing yet
One man ran, tryna get away from it
Put your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh
Into your chamber like Freddy enter dream
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause, like a black jack to dat
You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertaining motherfuckers can't stop O
In battling, you don't want me to start tattling
All up on the stage cause y'all snakes keep rattling
Bitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you wanna clock me like Sherry
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry
Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in, and get ten dollars back
The fat LP with Cappachino on the wax
Pass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LPs back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt and dial 9-1-7
1-6-0-4-9-3-11
And you could get long dick hip-hop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction
I'm Staten Island best son, fuck what you heard
Niggas still talking that shit is absurd
My repertoire, is U.S.S.R
P.L.O. style got thrown out the car
And ran over by the Method Man Jeep
Divine can't define my style is so deep
Like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy
Like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind
Cause you weak in the knees like SWV
Tryna get a title like Wu Killa Bee
Kid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbott
Me and RZA rhyme name printed in the tablet
Under vets, we paid our debts for mad years
Hibernate the sound and now we out like bears
In Born Power, born physically, power speaking
The truth in the song be the pro-black teaching




Yo, what up, this is for Kreators
Ain't no sweat, same old game, we love the honey ("with you, with you")
We love the honeys, everywhere a chick, chick
There a chick, there a chick, everywhere ("said I'm ready now, oh")
Yo, uh-huh, bigger Don', yo


I love a honey, half Chinese, and half Gayanese
Be quick, drop to her knees
Don't even ask me shit, always on the stroll
I'm lookin' for a straight hood rat chick
Something to go home with
Something I just might wanna be alone with
Something I don't have to play the phone with
All I gotta do is, just bone the shit
First night, that's when I meet that chick
I'm on the strip, C-Don, yeah, girl get a grip
You know my steelo, army fatigue
Timberland boots, don't let me intrigue
But I gotta smoke a blunt with you
Straight up and down, play the front with you
I just wanna stunt with you, cuz you my fly boo
Yeah, you know how we do


"With you, with you" (baby girl, come walk with me, man)
"With you, with you" (let's go over here, youknowhatimean, to the bodega)
"Said I'm ready now, oh" (let me get a Dutch, and a good wrap
It's so necessary, man, so we can just swing one, you know, yo)


Yo, what's the deal gorgeous?
I can't hit you on your Sprint cordless?
And one day, talk about it over food orders
I'm Lounge Lo, where you from, how I figured out
It's all good, what's your name? I wanna dig you out
And make you something, get dough and break you something
Spend time, plus dine at the lake or something
Have sex foreplay, and watch a tape or something
Yeah baby, let's get it on, the wave is nothing
Wild style thug, still run with an eight
Got a chick now, gettin' it crunk fifth in the waist
And she dealin with a cat like me exactly
Like, givin' love names and callin' me Blacky
I said, that's my girl, that's my twenty two
Its all love, so the hell what the money do
That's my girl, that's my twenty two
Its all love so the hell, what the money do, stupid


"With you, with you"
"With you, with you"
"Said I'm ready now, oh"
What's your name, do you drink champagne?
Do you smoke a little weed? Do you pop ecstasy?
Do you got seeds? It's all gravy
This the baby daddy, huh, give me a kiss


You better join us, cuz you can't beat us
With professional cheaters, who clutch chrome heaters
Under wife beaters, at Club Cheetah's, so nice to meet us
In them Daisy Duke shorts, no Boss Hog and no Cletus
Love look fierce, three karats in their ears
Gold stud in the bottom lip, and diamonds in her tongue pierce
Shook what her mama gave her, a Playboy bunny
And plus she tail links with a major player
And that's nothing but scandal, and hot wax
Drippin' on your back, incense smoke and mad candels
Body paints, graffiti on your flesh, spray painted on the walls like vandals
She say Jaysaun, so kinky, bright glow on her pinky toe
Green so sticky, the waya I'm handlin' mines
Ought to be a crime, last word bitch
Seek and you'll find, we get it


"With you, with you"
"With you, with you"
"Said I'm ready now, oh"




Yo, too advanced, Digi' stance, made the CD enhanced
I move with the speed and strength of ants
Identical in form with the Bees they swarm
Hold up, the cold current appear warm
My first verbal brawl, started on some yes yes y'all
To the beat y'all, break your windshield, your jeep stall
Mr. Traffic, dumbin shit, from ecclesiastic
Cashier, holdin out, fine, cut off the plastic
See the logo? A monument in hip-hop
Carved out, in the giant landscape of broken rocks
Whether heard in herb spots, jukebox or malt shops
Uncut live, drop eighty-five, in one shot
Spotlight hits the metal mic, majority stare
Heard the Wu snare, while my iris cut down the glare
Walk a road the great length you find too long to measure
My Clan'll make me rhyme like D. Banner under pressure
No surprise, double disc touched five
Those elements kept environments colonized
With the high flying death-defying flow like the Rebel
Right there, but you're one light year from my level


Uh-huh.. yeah.. yo.. check it.. yo..
Bottles goin' off in the church, we broke the wine
Slapped the pastor, didn't know Pop had asthma
He pulled out his blue bible, change fell out his coat
Three condoms, two dice, one bag of dope
Oooh! Rev. ain't right, his church ain't right
Deacon is a pimp, tell by his ice
Mrs. Parks said, "Brother Starks, meet you at the numbers spot
Heard you got red tops out, and I want a lot"
Shirley fainted dead on the spot
Two ushers slipped eighty dollars right out the pot
Oh shit!


Egyptian, brown skin brown suede Timbs
Masqueradin X-rated throw blades, all occasions
Round nozzle touchdown, Haagen-Daas gobbles White House
Gucci flag on the roof, call us rock groups
Mere intelligent, buy Neimann Marcus out
No doubt, all we saw he bought, Lori mom's all blow
Was simple, blamp instrumentals run camps the stamps get you
The way we lamp, fans come and get you
Play, fullback strapped like a fuck, war at
The black, Carlo Gambino's stash house in Hackensack
Pack capsules, Green Bay 'em lay 'em down like wax do
It's all actual we build, like Crash Crew
Coconut, incense, one sentence, aiyyo
Control the holy flinch hit this, new whips
Roman numerals, sun splash them niggas like, Tango and Cash
Alcatraz cats roll out fast..


Wu thousand nuthin but hardcore
We tryin to get land riches and more
Ghost put me on to it
We just do it, floss or whatever
Take care of the business, there's too many roughnecks
Give two of these to Flex, tell him it's real rap like Ghost
Had to beat niggas with toast
Clubs V.I. clientele we lay it down flat
Pulled out on y'all kid, now where your mans at?
Fakin the real like, "Damn I can't stand Cappa'"
Then my wardrobe flooded the next chapter
Y'all heard about us like we heard about you
Bless the mic with reality, hit you with the virtue
Calm down not tryin to hurt you, burst through
That shit, fatter than all y'all niggas outfits
We the glitch like Y2K
Catch the ball when it drop, guns pop, y'all have a nice day

"Doctor Kanabuta, Iron Man, he is invincible
His remarkable armor is supreme!"


Yo, sometimes I'm liable to spaz and break fool
Grab my gun, select one, snatch son
Put the barrel by his face, blast one by his eardrum
Piss run, you drop thinkin you shot
Screamin like a bitch, kicks to your face
Shots to the body that shake like the bass
I'm Ghostfaced up, military style down
Nuff ammunitions of rounds across the chest


Skip to the intro, rap through po'
Smashed a fresh ball of wax ceasar
Flashy penthouse that overlooks the vista
Wally Moc' half tied, swimmin trunks
Three chunks of ice sit in Johnny Walker for advice
Catch the moment, fundraiser at will, work with the homeless
Polish diamond edge, Flintstone shit, sealed in a comb pick
Carefully, swing the B seven series Christmas lights
Too bright Ghost is comin y'all fix the mirrors
Relax like pudding, confidence strangle my man couldn't
Exile he no longer in the hood
Bless the kid that max the most
Me I turn a wedding into hoax
Roses tied to bombs on posts
On commercial breaks, piss in the apple juice
Rasta nigga rock the big do's
Jiffy Pop it's only chant Wu




"What we're gonna do right here is go back, way back, back into time"
"Here we go!"
"OK everybody!"
"Sing my song" "Step up to this" (Both X4)

I'll break a nigga back, when I'm holding the mack
Me and Cap bridging the gap, on one track
The S.I.N.Y. and the Cack-lack
I crack a nigga open like I'm drinking six packs
It's on and popping in the bottom
Stop a nigga in the mud if he got a problem
It's dirty out here, walk around with so much ice
I need a slay, Wayne Gretzky and they call me when it sudden death
I feel like Rocky when he ran a hundred steps
That ain't beef, that's pocket meat on your chest, boy
I move keys like I'm on the keyboard
Big Rush on the Triton, I got the license
To pay a sniper when I'm writing
On this microphone, I'm Mike Tyson
How Street Fighter niggas call me M. Bison
I stay high in my blood pressure, the slug'll dead ya
Pack burners that'll give niggas the war, it's real


Nickel plated tech with the shiny pearl handle
Red infer' beam on the so-called vandal
Original legits, still cool like Summer Sam
You got a three hundred watt, with a low key light candle
Burning up the jam, oh, Donna can't cook
You and the dummy hit the head, Oh Donna had you hooked
On the snub nose, because I never dug those
Part time crime, bust me from behind
Niggas that play sometime, most of the time
With the nine, big dummy bullets are blind
So to arm me and protect, you gotta move correct
And play humble, as you prepare for the rumble
Then glide like a snake, and let off like the bumble
Two bigger trigger, I figure I got a lotta
One tough, hit the fucked up by Don Dada
I'm my all black self, with the 90 shot clip
Waiting patiently for my posse to flip
So I can wet something love-love, push come to shove-shove
Might have to wet a nigga up with the snub bug
Thirty eight pistol, handle rough like Crisco
Cousin Cappa, shatter competition like crystal


If, life's a hustle, I grind it out
So I can cop the big face, watch, diamoned out
Eyes chinky in the Bentley, pulling up in the drive way
Like Sinatra, nigga, I did it my way
Repping East side, with guns on each side
Last nigga tried, you know that he died
Who real round here, blue steel round here
Little ears on the block, get ya peeled round here
I'm the man with the rock, giving feels round here
If you want it, I can get that, hit you with a big pack
Don't bring my shit back, six in your knick knacks
Don't mean no harm, but I'm shooting with big gats
This and a flip jack'll make your ass flip back


Yeah, fuck that, uh-huh, walk with me
I'm good with thousand grams, and a well in the will
While you polly in the hood, I'm on Federal Hill
Moving and shaking, underground, using Jamaicans
Moving these cakes in Montego, shoot up, ya naked
Get on and beat it, charge money, son, it's large money
Rubberband wrapped under the hard wood floor, money
And I ain't gonna spend a red cent
I'm just sitting on bread, try'nna get this red shit
I live for them dead presidents, ever since there was facts, high paids
I was try'nna get paid, nigga, I left 10th grade, for the american dream
Hitting hoods hard with that heroine lean
You only dream about my way of life, day or night
I'mma get it, just as long as we poor, fuck the law


Yeah, uh-huh, Street Flavor, word up
Yeah, nigga, uh-huh, give it up or get slumped, nigga
That's how we coming through...
Fifty one, thirty six, Bel Air Road, nigga
Street Flavor...



Intro: Method Man

Ain't what you want baby
It's what you need baby
Ain't what you want baby
It's what you neeeeeeeed

Verse One: RZA

Yo diamond crystal rings sharp like icicles
Nickel plated pistols, official Wu-Wear covers my physical
Insulated thermal Wallabees drain they co four butt solos
Photographic prototype static-free motivated soldier
Or Wu say boulder head flower
You can detect the true and living God from his aura
Keep your sword straight, maintain your weight
But he ate too much monosodiumglutumate, and polysorbate
And drunk grape concentrate, with sodium benzoate
Fried the chicken thighs in triglycerides
And his bitch advertised her breast size
Eighty-five didn't realize, til the truth opened up his eyes
Then he became highly civilized
And spent time amongst the wise, went through a garment renaissance
And stopped wearing Benetton
Tommy Hill, Perry Ellis, Nautica, or Liz Claiborne
Ocean Pacific, Fila, Bill Blass and leave fitted
Quit the Armani sweaters with the Gucci wool knitted
Now all he buys, Kani's, Cross Colours, Shabazz Brothers
Mecca, Pelly Pell, 88, North Q, Bear and a few others
For the new year, strictly Wu-Wear

Chorus: Method Man

Ain't what you want baby
It's what you need baby
Ain't what you waaaaaant

Verse Two: Cappadonna

Pelle Pelle had the top dresser
One man catalog the London Fog casual hog
Bear denim with the Cash Wu Nike and Kangol king
Everyday, DLO jacket equipped with the drawstring
Fila supply big daddy Starter hat, The brown-skin derby match the Tommy Hill; Advil
Double button Woolridge, red dickie turtleneck
Mockneck, eighteen carat holdin my twenty-two shine
In this like Macy's or Bloomingdale's
The Century 21 son, the new portfolio dunn
Now it's my time, Asian Wu-Wear, Cappa fleece wear
One wear plaza, Donna hold the best of all year
Plus blue wear, Wu-Wear, what's going on
We're the best of this year, Wu-Wear and fleece wear

Verse Three: Method Man

Ain't what you want baby
It's what you need baby
Just come see me
Satisfaction guaranteed baby
Just hold your own baby
And just rock on baby
I got this wine on my mind
Feelin fine darlin
Now all you see baby
Ain't what you need baby
I wanna know just how low
It goes
Official nasty asses, straight shots in dirty glasses
Wu-Wear fleece for you and your stinkin piece
Hard time and killer tactics

Repeat 2x




Yo, You can't keep a good man down
I been through it all, I step on the ground
Even my best friend turned they back
And my label mate brothers wasn't cutting me no slack
Nobody gave a shit they wasn't even checking for Cap
Taking my kindness for weakness, Peep this the weak shit
Stealing my songs putting em out on the sneak tip
Label could never hold me, The Devil can't slave me
I'm thankful for everything that God gave me
I never really want shit but I'm happy I done shit
I hope to keep my life free from the guns and clips
Plus I'm still tryna get Momma out of the bricks
Come on now, Tell me that you praying for me
You should of known, That Christ was staying with me
Win or lose, Adding on to life be the life I choose
I use to sell crack, Now I'm just dropping the jewels
Why is life gotta be so hard, Why the street try to leave me scarred
Why is everybody looking for God
I had to leave Park Hill, I'm a traveling man
I don't stay in one spot that's why I travel the land
Whether I get a deal or not, I'ma still deal with the block
Yall biters try to steal my spot, Duplicate my music
Take my slang, Take cheap shots at me while I'm doing my thang
I'm more close with my seeds, A little older now, I learned to forgive
While yall kicking dirt on Don I'm building a bridge
Treading through the waters, Yall thought I would drown
But you can't keep a good man down




You can't keep a good man down
I'm rising up, Imma little smarter
I see through your falsehood, your lies & stuff
Turned out in the game, I was burnt out in the game
No matter what everbody still knowin' my name
I'm not materialistic, I'm not caught up in the fame
I make a joyful noise, Im tryna bring about a change
Sing a harp with 10 strings like the angels out
Rush closed the store down gust took my house
Let my enemies rise & fall till' the day that they gotta be called
Please recognize my fruit, my heart be the flute
My brains is black gold
You can buy my CD's but you can't buy my soul
Im Melinda's son, Big Mr. Hill
Big Cappa Don, y'all wanted me killed so that the truth couldn't be revealed
Your witchcraft & your devil worship, it don't work on me
My sword bear love you could build a church on me
So put your hands together for the unordinary light
I spread fish be the bread of life
The armor of God, God's to pour through the night
Regardless I fear no evil, y'all pharoahes better let go of my people
It's the annointed, survival of the generation of Nas
So whoever can't see better open they eyes
Hold onto my proverb like a woman in disguise
Allure & seduce you and adulturous that lies
Prayed upon his precious life
Please nourish my thought like a wife
And may the lost generation be found
Because you can't keep a good man down....




You can't keep a good man down
Don't force my hand, It's the original black man
The spies are rejected, I came through when my life was hectic
God raised me up though, Brought me through a tuff time
I couldn't put it in rhymes
I was coked up and weeded, I travel with the heaters
I was being seduced by all of these spiritual readers
Looking into my future, Tryna stop my shine
Eating from the forbidden trees, They was after my mind
But the burden wasn't heavy enough
To many dudes kept passing me dust
My ex-wife, Cutting up chickens, Rituals in the graveyard
Didn't have no effect on me cause I was walking with God
Warlocks and feminims, Tryna keep me away from Lounge and Kim and them
Knowing that my family tree
Will give me strength when the Devil try to drop his G
Got me caught up in a circle of fire
Momma told me that the Devil was a lier
So I smoke more weed and I started to get higher
I gave up all of my possessions and all of my attire
I fasted, And I become more closer with the Messiah
At the same time, These Devils try to keep me blind
Thinking I forgot about Christmas time
Like they was nimrod, And had my balls hanging on a branch
On some Santa Claus shit they invaded my ranch
Looking at me all dumb like I'm an ordinary lamb
But I'm a sheep in a green pasture, I see past ya
I stopped, And I took a look at the slave and his master




You can't keep a good man down
I'm rising up, Imma little smarter
I see through your falsehood, your lies & stuff
Turned out in the game, I was burnt out in the game
No matter what everbody still knowin' my name
I'm not materialistic, I'm not caught up in the fame
I make a joyful noise, Im tryna bring about a change
Sing a harp with 10 strings like the angels out
Rush closed the store down gust took my house
Let my enemies rise & fall till' the day that they gotta be called
Please recognize my fruit, my heart be the flute
My brains is black gold
You can buy my CD's but you can't buy my soul
Im Melinda's son, Big Mr. Hill
Big Cappa Don, y'all wanted me killed so that the truth couldn't be revealed
Your witchcraft & your devil worship, it don't work on me
My sword bear love you could build a church on me
So put your hands together for the unordinary light
I spread fish be the bread of life
The armor of God, God's to pour through the night
Regardless I fear no evil, y'all pharoahes better let go of my people
It's the annointed, survival of the generation of Nas
So whoever can't see better open they eyes
Hold onto my proverb like a woman in disguise
Allure & seduce you and adulturous that lies
Prayed upon his precious life
Please nourish my thought like a wife
And may the lost generation be found
Because you can't keep a good man down...



Intro/Chorus: Blue Raspberry

You left me here, alone, with a shine
All hope was gone, I couldn't find
My world alone, how could I break my home
Still I doubted you, and still your strength
Enchanted me, you was a father to my child
And a man to me, now I'm so lost
Strong hearts, run free
Run free, young hearts
Young hearts, run free
Run free, young hearts


Girlfriend, what you did was wrong
Even though the love was strong, you moved on
Never had faith in the Don, you was safe
With the Don, and then you walked out
A broken house, a broken heart
Cry for my dart, we had a plan
We was woman and man, the hourglass
Held the sand, I held you like contraband
But you didn't understand when the four devils
Came inside of your life that night
We argued and fight, you knew it wasn't right
Fucked up our life, my thoughts come stronger
Every ounce, it's not my fault
That you wanted to bounce, now you tellin me
That you cleaned up your act, beep me every time
But I never call back, that's how I felt
When you was makin me crack
Me leave wifey for you??

I'm crying
I'm crying

Chorus


Young hearts, run free
Run free, young hearts
Young hearts, run free...
