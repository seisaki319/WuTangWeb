Bobby said, "Fuck spending fifty on a whip, buy equip"
Mental flip, he got a thousand tracks stored on a chip
Said he had mad toys to make noise
He split and separate drums like asteroids
The concerned producer sampled this question
Hit him with the beat for the answer with extra compression
My sound travel, it quickly grab you
And equalize the pitch up, until it have you
Bugged out, tryna think you can match this
The portraits are too graphic
Panoramic view for you, stamp Wu
The beats are Gothic, the outcome will be catastrophic
We roadblocked it, checkpoints on your next joint
Now who the nigga you anoint?
700 volts on the track to slay
Murderous wordplay displayed from killing cascades
Throwing bullets in the air to test wind
Which way the cyclone spin? Counter or clockwise?
Still civilized
Kill spies on the wall as still flies, all dies


Give no extension on the lynching
It's tension if the name of the Clan is mentioned
It's the aura that's felt that causes one to flash his gun
And reveal how he really feel, confirmed
He'll never live after the show
See the promoter for the dough I'm taking, breaking his wax
Throwing my shit on to perform the selection from the Swarm
Day 2 breaks, it's a stormy Monday
My ninjas lay in ravines and ditches underneath shrubs and leaves
They breathed through underwater reefs
The enemy walks above, Clan remains subterraned in mud
Off shore banks, tanks approach the location
Bombarded by the circle of death formation
Telecom lines are sniped from these low altitude strikes
Shattering bulletproof helmets with shrapnel fragments of cell
Inhale these venomous thoughts that I propel
Through the north facility, the city must suffer
At the hand of the Chief's command, volts are sent
At three minute intervals the heat intenses
Deadening the power from electrical fences
Defences are down, shake a nigga up
Bounce him off the sound


You know what I'm saying?
The God ca-diver, in the streets of Iris
We talk about sex, money and drugs
(Ruled by power) And y'all cats don't know
What it's about (Love and power)
It goes deeper than what you see on TV
Killah Priest, come on


Burning desire, ebony eyes
Painted toenails, legacies die
Women by the well, Egyptian queens
Arabian sheiks paid to knock off rich kings for the joy some sing
Graveyards filled with scarlet widows
Who stabbed they husbands sleeping on silk pillows
Blood on they robes, disguised as beggar in cheap wool clothes
Lambs and wolves in black hoods pull out they gats
Like magic wands, casting spells, sending niggas to Hell
Trapping they souls in realms
Baptize them with Holy Water
Springing on the heads of plenty witches' daughters
Interviews with the richest reporters, silent nights over Nevada
A thousand Muslims bow before the Kaaba
Hebrews flee to the hills of Masada
For the love of God, guns make a loud sound
I'mma show you how thugs get down
Shootouts, bullets turn into bloodhounds and hunt you down
Cursed nation, lost generation
X-Files found them in the future as cosmic rulers
Fallen angels from space intruders
Dying saints, blood spilled on the floor like wet paint
See it in the pictures, read it like the lost scriptures
Absorb it with your 100 proof liquor


I shot the sheriff and the deputy secondly
Threatening the lives of those who threaten me
Lessening my chances of defeat by predetermining the victory
As taught by Sun Tzu in the chapter, after the third one
I heard my word shall be born, regardless to anything or anyone
Or else I die by the gun, my life has just begun
Thought I was living all along, but I was wrong
This long road I have to travel in countless battles
These filthy snakes with poison fangs and rattles
Kings, queens and pharaohs change to cattle
Unable to duck the Devil's arrow
Singing that his eye's on the sparrow, mind narrow
Superstitions, horoscopes and tarots
'Hark Heralds Angels' and Christmas carols
Graven images hang from the mantels
Man-made slaves in modern day Babel
Brought from Africa in golden robes and sandals
By wicked thieves and vandals
Who manhandled us with leather whips and burning candles
And rambled through our castle, leaving niggas shambles
Stole our golden sodas like some Arab camels
We gazed, amazed and baffled as he loaded his ammo
Into the barrel and blasted out our bone marrow
We were the Gretel and the Hansel, tricked by this wicked jackal
Children of my grand-old-daddy have me
In mind when they're lost in this wilderness blind




We will fight till the night is done
We will live our lives tonight as one
We will live our lives tonight as one, one


I'm a bad mother, shut your mouth
Insanity, DVD, how I stretch 'em out
What the stress about? INS best out
Fact, you knew that before he left the house
Fresh at the produce section
Gaze at my shine like a showroom necklace
Death wish, stepping in Deck's direction
I'm checking niggas like test questions


Across 110th now, cross Belmont and Montauk
Camera hawk hawks the sidewalk
When they get to flexing muscle niggas bust you
Hustlers do you, gave you your first toolie
Cutting out of school to pump your first loose leaf
Think graduate to wait, take it out of state, duct tape
Anything of pulse and heroin
Emcees frozen, cuban link chains are golden
I'm ownin' everywhere I'm holdin' it up, to keep it raw
Math here, I got 'em keep coming back for more


Yo, man, I'm so turned up, all the marijuana burned up
Y'all don't want the drama, word up
The Wu first up, the game is the world versus us
Y'all was good 'til the world heard us
Y'all ain't want them Clan birds up
Y'all don't want your man served up, that'll get the fans worked up
Homie really wanna play, stir it up
I'mma catch me a wave, surfs up
Gliding on the track like this, make me wanna act like this
Make me wanna smack that trick
Make a killer really wanna yap that kid
If he opens up his yap that's it




Mass of minerals in a glass house
Playing 4th the Wu neutrinos will blast out
Letting out verbal thunder bolts
Until the world attract old and younger folks
Charge with the vitality of magnetism
In large reality with massive rhythm
The manual without technical part
From the beginning give off an electrical spark


I respect you if you respect me
Everything's for real, WTC
No fake ass shit, don't front the Remy
Break bread, never have pockets empty
Let's get it, flip it up then we can spend it
The money train, Killa Beez on your brain
W's everywhere, one on your chain
Homeboys for life, please don't change
You can hide at my house, it ain't no thing
If you see the pigs, don't say jack
Call me original, don't say cap
I'm on the low, might be at the murder
Holding off the place y'all cats never heard of
Yeah, chicks wanna peep me out
Nasty ass, want me to pee in their mouth
But now I'm out, about to link with sticks




Bang a few notes up top, we call it beast mode
Forget the street codes, show you like a deep throat
It gets rougher, you suffer from the heat stroke
Blast barrels, embrace my leaf smoke
Park Hillians radio for back up
Polish your act up, nigga need a back up
Syrup in my cup, no cut, straight up
UG's on the court, never miss a lay up


When the emcees came to live out their names
Some rode the bus, some rode the train
Some motherfuckers wish they never came
When they met the nine swordsmen of Wu-Tang
Nine Maseratis pulls up to this party hard
Body, the party is filled with Godbody
There out of shape models coming through with those bottles
And double D's please, all eyes follow
Pass me a bucket of ice, that's nice
Hit with the vodka, what you say proper
I drink with the copper, show up in a chopper
Stop her, she wanna have a mnage  trois
I can tell by the bra, RZA Ra-KZA-Keem is all is Allah
Do you wish or wish upon a star? Do you wish or wish upon a star?






Yeah, yeah
Master Allah Self Hate
Shaolin cipher heat, niggas
For my militant soldiers
Yeah, check it out, yo, yo


As night falls the commando's teams seize the palace
Fiercely assault commands the volts
Explode in the air like lightning bolts
We ripping out your spleen
At battlegrounds like the dense jungles of Philippines
Drunk monk sip O.E. out the canteen
Men at war with guillotines
Safari of Japanese troops not waiting
All you hear is bullets penetrating
Deep like the assassination that almost killed Reagan
War troops in army suits with spiked boots
Lyric proof brutes camouflage the haunted igloo
Eskimo commando dressed to kill in camo
Black Rambo I civilize for ammo, bulletproof parachutes
We motorate helicopters with green bags of loot
Bloodthirst heroes after Vietnam we made the wheelchair
No fear, warfare at its highest 


I snatch up defeated troops in desert Timb boots
Camouflage like the sands I locate in Iran
For war be the issue, elite crews and God jewels
Snipers on the rooftop, watch out for the pit bulls
We waited till sunsets and moving like ninjas
Camouflage masked avengers, y'all niggas best surrender
We servicing your weapons we be the Armageddon
Killarmy bring on board this military acquisition
Your crew will take position on the seven seas mission
Beretta 9 be wild like convicts in San Quenton


5 Star General giving killing orders
Militant assassins surround the headquarters
5 Star General giving killing orders
Militant assassins surround the headquarters


Let's go to war with break beats, my battleground is in the streets
Shogun Samurai Assason the professional spectacle
Mental terrorist plant a time bomb in your ear
And hold your brain for hostage
Killarmy equipped with detonating swords
Captivate the crowd leave 'em praising the Lord
In the Asiatic War we chop heads off
Like General Monk and his swordsmen
The reason is burning season my brothers is guilty of high treason
So I decapitate them as they lay motionless bleeding on the canvas
I put away my weapon which is stainless


Yo, it's the 5 Star General


5 Star General giving killing orders
Militant assassins surround the headquarters
5 Star General giving killing orders
Militant assassins surround the headquarters


5 Star Generals, word up


Here's the non-carnivorous lyricist rhyming protagonist
Absorbing thoughts through my elements rip out your pancreas
Try to exit and get caught like a venereal disease
Niggas freeze before I squeeze
It's impossible to run when I'm done
Dom Pachino the son saving my universe now awaiting trial
Unidentified profile got you sewn like a textile
Lyrical navigator exploring different worlds
Mxyzptlk style equipped with a vest
Killarmy vigilantes got MCs marked for death
Evil targets taking their lives like Grand Auto Theft
Then motivate like Dr. David Banner
Moving in bulletproof air crews with CB scanners
I channel my life can never be a manual
Unpredictable historical like a Greek oracle
Words pronounced plural
And shot through my 


Science is the study of all things knowledge their sword swing
Guns go off from the east wing
It's a blessing to deliver this lesson
Who's resting? You've been summoned to awaken
A nation of sleeping giants who are clients to the devil civilization
Migration expands my plan to the maximum capacity
(Drop bombs) Nothing can hold me
From launching out over the Earth then disperse
Ritual darkness niggas return
Unscathed and at ease and as you were
But the thought of not being able to breathe and leave
These worldly possessions have MCs fret to step in my direction


5 Star General giving killing orders
Militant assassins surround the headquarters
5 Star General giving killing orders
Militant assassins surround the headquarters


Word up, militant assassins

See, niggas in the place that bit my style
Well, I'm a singer, dancer, we bulletproof brothers
Wu-Tang got the answer
Cause if I had a chance to do it again
I will still keep the heat in my pants-uh


Y'all be nice to the crackheads, everybody listen up
I shot one of my bitches, the ho ain't trick enough
Word life to big screen Don, tapping dustbones out
With starwriters like I fucked Celine Dion
Stuck everything that's the god's honest beyond
We airin' niggas out, that's the type shit that we on
Official Wu-Tang headbanger
Flood your space with big waves like you did in Sri Lanka


I drink heavy gallons of cru, play the big part
Niggas got squid on the grill, selling kids Clarks
Finesse notes, yo, the Guess on with the vest pose
Yellow swede one matching hat with the grey gun
Niggas be rhymin' for nothing, then my team pull up
We all throw down y'all broke niggas stay frontin'
Lines come digital stupid, plus ain't got no jewelry on
Bet I'm still live and I'm coopin'
Two of my silverbacks run through a pack of your wolves
Front on react, we're sippin' Cognac  relax dude
Know I'm with these cracks dude


Yo, 1-2, Dirt McGirt
Solid tone smith with 6th shots, lick shots
Leave your head like a Shaolin monk with 6 dots
Brooklyn Zoo, Zoo
Brooklyn Zoo


It's the return of Bin Laden, grab your armor
Smash pretty boy niggas, crush their karma
Eat bones with alligators, roll deep with my entourage
My whole crew's fresh out the bars
Diggler AKA the Cab Driver
Drop him off in the middle of fire
Dirty Island, drag bodies to the Murderland
Knock niggas out hurtin' my hand


I remember in the elevator we was playin' corners
Now we play the corners and the cops is stayin' on us
Staten's where the war is
Where the court system's running out of warrants
Where TNT be jumping out the Taurus
For real I can't call it
You see I love Lucy cause she Lawless
Exactly like that 1-0-3-0-4 is
Snitch niggas swallow your tongue
Already know the island I'm from
And y'all don't want no problems with them


We got a history full of lightning victories
Conceptual breakthrough, it ain't no mystery
Long vision from giants in every way
Rap czars, magnificent flows for every day
From the East to the 'ville, from the West to the hills
Incredible rhymes, encouraging skills
From rat packs, the smallest crews were enormous
We hit 'em fast with an effortless performance
MCs start fleeing in flocks
Especially those that's more sensitive to heat and shock


We grindin' down to the bone, my name grounded in stone
I'm Mr. Violence we loungin' with chrome
Mr. Violence we lounge in his home, hit the housing on Rome
Shining like a hundred thousand in stones
Move mountains with poems, got a jones for dinero
1-6-zero my songs we throwin' elbows
The hoes cling, sho thing, we know kings
Only dime dikes with minds right, we choose Queens


Yeah, we wild like rockstars who smash guitars
Yo son split his face with the toast, he ain't ghost
It's no joke iron coat rifle with the stroke
One toke brains float, shot to the throat
Before the smoke hit, witness the killing, chilling crime scene
Body on the block, eyes open from the shock
Of being popped in the neck
Yet he still held a lit cigarette between his fingers
Danger when you step into the chamber with the Masta
Disaster, gotta blast ya cause I have to


The rat pack is back from the island of Stat'
Leave you cursed dust, cause you worship the Gat
The first one to snap drunk off the Smirnoff
Blow the bouncer's ear off, let him floss he the boss
Handcuffed, to the turntables like Wizard Theodore
See it's pure, let it rain pearly ounces
Bang him with the thing that hang from the trousers
You don't want no drama, I'm flaming fast
That nigga jumped up and did the Damon Dash




Yo, this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
For all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it

Yo, in the housing, thousands seen early graves
Victims of worldly ways, memories stays engraved
All my live brothers, is locked down with high numbers
The young hunger, blind to these lies, they die younger
In this New World the Order slaughter men, women, and children
Ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in
The projects, lifeless like a vietnam vet
Constant war, sever threats of enemy conquest
Crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble
Streets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble
Vivid thoughts, Devils resort to trick knowledge
They kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars
I know the pain the game bring, I did the same thing
Spaced out in the staircase, performing a sting
It's hard to keep control, I bless those who seek a scroll
Trying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
Not a role model, I walk a hard road to follow
I sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
The gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole
Mentally they fold, and they eventually sold
Their life and times, deadly like the virus design
But too, minute to dilute, the scientist mind


You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way


A voice cries from the wilderness of the North
A representation of the families that lost one
All victims of incarceration
Or other divisions of the family structure
Youths are injected with serums that leads
To skin irritations, babies being born with
Disfigurations, experimentations
On their faces there bear worry-ations
Of mothers that carry the pain
Of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
Fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
It lightly begins to rain screams of terror
Are hidden by the passing trains
This can't be little Hussein, his uncle cried
As he drops to his nephew's side, holding his cane
Just give me a name, of who has inflicted this
Bitter sickness, and left us to witness


Yeah, yo
Curses from war, innocent blood spills for days
Soothe in godly ways, hands, solemn in praise
Tree of life, more precious than rubies, golden game
The wise shall flourish inherit, Halls of Fame
Crime visions in my blood got me, locked in prison
While we die hard living people whine about religion, vision
Blow, spin, and sin and killing what's revealing
It's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen
Zero process, progress, become the hunted
America's most wanted, good life flaunted, want it
Some love the speed, some satisfy a need
Some want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed
The strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed
One flew astray, and it caught my little seed
Can it be, the ice savage, trife life, made me grab the knife
The righteous man was beat with many stripes, pipes
Take in my energy, breath and know the rest
Cause the good die young and the hard die best


You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way


Y'all bitches love dances, and pulling down your pants
While your man's on tour, your spending up his advances
Your friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke, and suck dick
The whole projects is trapped in stench
You either high school drop-outs, one to three cop-outs
Fifteen years old, shorty ass and top out
Ninety-nine cent beer drinking pussy stinking
Fucking so much your ass and titties start shrinking
New World Order slave trade, minimum wage, Medicaid
Can a devil fool a Muslim nowadays
Inside my lab, I'm going mad
Took two drags off the blunts, and started breaking down the flag
The blue is for the Crips, the red is for the Bloods
The whites for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs
Or the slugs that ignites, through the night, by the dawn
Early light, why is sons fighting for the stripe


As we dwell through this concrete hell, calling it home
Mama say, take your time young man and build your own
Don't wind up like your old dad
Still searching for them glory days he never had
So many bad want to scheme for American dream, no more kings
The cash rule everything now, we going down
These babies looking up to us, it's up to us
The Million Man March MC's, get on the bus
But envy, greed, lust, and hate, separate
Though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
No longer, brothers, we unstable
Like Kane when he slew Abel, killing each other


You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way




Wake up... wake up
Wake up...


Wake up, get a hold of your life, go get your cake up
The motto in the streets is you eat, or you get ate up
Straight up, you tired of waiting, go get your weight up
My peoples tired of waiting for reparations to pay us
Screaming Jesus can save us, I, I get the Bentley if I save up
But that's just another trick to enslave us
Push the minimum wages
Put, put our fathers up in them cages
Then watch out when mother struggled to raise us
But, but my ambition won't let me live in this poor condition
That doesn't care about color, creed, or your religion
Priests, politicians gotta listen to opposition
From my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in
From my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in


Allah said to save the babies from the cold
Pour wisdom in the cup so the truth overflows
Still, knowledge is that bread that keeps us well-fed
Old time religion will not bring us satisfaction
Without action now who can disagree with me?
God is not a mystery, there's nowhere in history
That you could show and prove to me
But still you face east and nod your head to me religiously
I'm G-O-D, to infinity, for real


The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me


Poor reparations, the Bush administration
Unequality, martial law, segregation
False hood, false teaching, false education
Now's the time for us to come amongst this nation
They deceiving us, they don't believe in us
They believe in that Cream like Julius Caesar
I'm like Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X with the heaters
Ripping the chains of the remains of all of the leaders
Never worship the image of evil swine eaters
I'm on the back of the bus with two fine divas
We in the jungle of life, but never jungle fever
I'm God-body all day long, spiritual life lessons
That I recite in this song
Trying to wake up everybody, can't we all get along?
For all my people that's out there persevering through the storm
Black fist, Staten Island, stand up, stand strong
Penetrate through the gate and bring the Clan along


The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me


Wake up and realise the times
That we living in the world is getting more iller than ever
Thought we was chillin', striving change for the better
But it was a dream like Martin Luther
He had a vision that could move a mountain
Protect one another, that's world to my brother Malcolm
As-salamu alaykum, alaykum as-salam
We want justice, police supposed to protect and serve
And then they shoot us down like wild animals
The nerve of them cold-hearted killers
With blue suits slaying our black youth
The earth cries from all the blood that's being spilled
We need a solution fast, get InshAllah bill
Let me educate them, translate it meaning God's will
It goes all in together, together how we are
To stand with a plan, provided we down to fall
And that's the Willie Lynch tactics that separated the masses
Taught us all to think backwards




The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me

We gonna change the world (x5)




Man Allah has blessed my life so beautifully
Its like selfish to complain about the storms and the rain
When all life that sprang, came from the rivers that ran
Refurbishing all land, Listen
I swam to completion of self satisfaction
Wanting for nothing, at harmony with everything
Knowing that, but bring all living things
A cycle that spins 360 like Michael
An angel screaming for peace but unheard
The people were asleep in the dark
Worshiping what they know not
Easily lead to the slaughter of the butcher
Stop, look and listen
A new birth awakening
A blind baby, saying please save me
And raise me righteously


See this rhymes all natural the mic can be
No shake powder protein in my phsyique
No creatine animal meat
I repeat see its all natural god its all natural
See this rhymes all natural the mic can be
No shake powder protein in my phsyique
No creatine animal meat
I repeat see its all natural god its all natural


See everything is a copy or replacement for the natural
Dieing never taste so sweet
Its just the way you dress it up
See meat been dead for weeks
Blood seeps from the plastic out the freezer
It leaks till you freeze it back
Like a body, if its nots been embalmed and packed
You know the recipe, cancer disease et cetera
You might say damn son put on some weight
He looking real good, on the inside he dieing slow  like America
Then you hire brother Obama to clean your house up
What a mess generations of incest came from the cades of the west
My newly written slang, speech from the east
Brings fulfilment to each one
That I might teach one, i heat up the meal before
Serving the hungry, for those who may come
Who are worthy, to sit among the righteous
To live life


See this rhymes all natural the mic can be
No shake powder protein in my phsyique
No creatine animal meat
I repeat see its all natural god its all natural
See this rhymes all natural the mic can be
No shake powder protein in my phsyique
No creatine animal meat
I repeat see its all natural god its all natural




Hey wait a minute, man, what about me?
Hey wait a minute, y'all got
Y'all play a role in a racket flow
It was an act of God
I don't know what kind of act it was
I don't know how a junkie bust into my room and stole my TV
Hey, it wasn't me, man
Why ain't you out here arrestin' him?
Instead of runnin' him out
It was me, I confess! I confess!
Dead story, a respectable workin' person can't even walk 5 minutes
On the street without somethin' happenin'
All you cops don't do nothin'!
Junkier than police, one right behind the other with his hand out
Oh, baby, he's gonna get rid of both of you cops


Ayo, we always gon' hit heads left and right
We always gon' get dumb skets to fight
We always smoke and drink to set shit right
Yo it's always gon' be left, to we left the light


We always gon' be thug niggas and see drug figures
Always gon' be stuck on the block, fuckin' with cops
Always gon' get McGirts, liftin' skirts
Turn around and let the click just work
We always gon' be chasin' cash, racin' fast
Like we don't need life yo
It's always gon' be street life
We always gon' bank the dough, spank the hoe
Drink some Mo', you better act like you think you know
It's always gon' be Queens N.Y
Always gon' be scenes when men die
We always gon' be doin' time for doin' crimes
It's always gon' be in Riker's Island
We always gon' be "life is wildin"
We always gon' be puffed out, mobbed out
With your bitch gettin' dogged out
And the click gettin' slobbed out
Love between thugs, it's love between clubs
It's always gon' be, like the giddy, it's always ownin' me
We always gon' shake the dice, stay laced in ice
Talk the Judas down when we hate the price
Always gon' keep it funky
It's always gon' be grungy
We always gon' eat cuz we always gon' be Hungry
We always gon' grab the dick, try to bag a chick
And walk around with a grill like we mad at shit
We always gon' be in project hallways
Crowdin' up the doorways, drownin' up the Jorday's
We always gon' be naughty
Liberty bassly, forty, niggas be crazy, whodi
Always




Yo it's a..


....warnin', East New York niggas formin'
Beats say Bang Ya Head, Sister Sledge
War dance with the wild Apache Indian
Get Tom machine gun, fast car, big engine
Few squads for the back massage, head job
Then it's back to business
Murder one, leave no witness
Snatch mic, bash face and fight
Red light scope at night
Movin' through the Snow dressed in White
It's the ninja from the rooftop site
Aim for the brain, snipe from the buildin' across the boulevard
Hit him from a hundred yards
I just got a type from 'Preme behind bars
Peace God, you beat niggas up, I suppose
Sixteen metal machine I still hold
Shoot snub from ear lobe
Fortified rich with Twelve Jewelz of Islam
Walk humble and calm
Newspaper under the arm conceal arms


You want it rough? That Hellfire stuff?
Poisonous mics, yo make the party jump
Delicious, the funk, make your heart pump
Told ya, soldiers get over the hump
Your arms are too short boy you don't wanna rump
With U-God the grump, van, black truck
Ha, heavy on the grams, every man back up
Niggas act up, let the style spin
This is Knockout Kings 2000 again
Let the style in for a few proud men
Clifton Project, rugged grain Shaolin
Women in the bed, wolves are fed
Same Wu Chamber that Bang Ya Head
Aim with the stainless, hang like dreads
Dirty at the game but the same celebs

Chorus


Yo, yo, yo
Is it the hate that make me sip the Hennessey straight?
Then go and leave my enemy face, simply erase
Make me hop out the Benz with the Tennessee plates
Make me run up in ya house shoutin', "Empty the safe"
Or could it be love? Make be rock the hoodie and gloves
Wonder if Snoop wasn't Crip, would he be Blood?
Or maybe it's where I'm from, Bushwick
That got me wearin' my gun everywhere that I come
Why your chick got my pubic hair on her tongue
Uh-huh, if you wanna see the light, nigga, stare at the sun
Can it be my older days that gave me my colder ways?
Blowin' strays at your rollerblades
Whatever it be, that make me take your leather and flee
Evidently, livin' legal never was me


Yo we livin' it, lovin' every minute, won't quit it
Hollow points aim with your first name printed
In it for the money, never did it for love
Made a few enemies, couldn't limit the slugs
Never talk much, got ways of handlin' such
The enforcer, cause the police to rush
On the daily, rarely seen, often heard
You can spot me in the Hill layin' off of the curb
On the verge of snatchin' up ya crown and throne
While I walk through the heart of the Hell and call it home
Shao' borough Commando, style thorough
Wild like a convict lose on the furlo 


Oh baby he's gonna get rid of both y'all cops




Continous
Yeah, youknowhatI'msayin?
Wu-Tang
Aiyyo aiyyo, come on yo yo yo I'mma shoot over here
On that AIDS thing
YouknowhatI'msayin? I'm gonna just slide in the studio quick and get this done
Yo, yo


When you're sexually frustrated, plus waiting for a long time
You both had strong minds
Combined with feelings, she seems appealing, for each other
Discreet lover, no longer keeps rubbers
Smothered under deep covers
Erotic programs, Moet and slow jams
Enough to make you hold hands and plus you a bold man
You fall in a manhole, where the forbidden tree grow
And bullshit ego, of fly negro
Her garden sour, polluted with a dead flower
Months later, he's layin on a respirator
Depending on a generator, to keep his heart moving
And start losing sight in his right eye
In weeks he might die


I know this dope-fiend cat, word up, his name is Javier
Part-time shooter sharing needles in the stairs
Wise guys disguised as a fly guy, you getting high right?
Weeded up with red shit in your right eye
You's a menace, your brain cells finished
Begging forgiveness, calling that up top shit syphillis
You know what you was gettin into
Try to guess on what I've been through
Fuck shorty raw then she scared you


AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from the Wu, it's real
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from my crew, it's real


My nigga Chuck, he loved to fuck
Everything exotic bitches down to ugly ducks
Like Nancy, who liked the fancy tickles so he put popsicles
On her nipples to make her sex passion triple quadriple
Until she bust
Overcome with passion, big ass want lust upon him
But nigga he forsake to grab the condom
Fuck it, he said AIDS, was government made
To keep niggas afraid so they won't get laid no babies be made
And the black population will decrease within a decade
German warfare product against the dark shade


AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from my crew, it's real
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from the Wu, it's real


Caught by the gravitation earth rotation
Six in the sex is deep, when you can't see clear
Through the sheer brassiere, toke back
Smoking a spliff, sippin cognac, God
You know my two love songs, Bobby Womack tracks
Got her fat ass layin flat on her back


Yo, as she lay, she wore a silk gray neglige
Alize pours, the radio play, Marvin Gaye
What's Going On? As she screams Sexual Healing
Couldn't fight the feeling her legs hit the ceiling
Hitting all positions dipped in for quick love
She's professional, she does this shit in strip clubs
Flied in June until she Acquired Immune Deficiency
Now misery is the syndrome


Oh shit, God that's wild
Damn, that's some cherry flavor shit going on though kid
For real, knowhatI'msayin?
What about the exotic type
Caskets is waitin for brothers
Word up slide on the joints baby
Before you go to sex take protection
Word up

AIDS kills, word up respect this
America Is Dying Slowly (4x)

Yeah, word yo, sliding up in this store right here
I ain't even playing that man, for real
Dig it
Respect how I'm living kid
Here forever, word up
Lubricated joints, ribbed joints is bangin
But they still playing the hotel door man
Word, you know how that be though, you know how that be
Yo, just gettin to be too old
Chick over there lookin like Sonny and Cher
Over there

America Is Dying Slowly
Surely
America Is Dying Slowly
America Is Dying Slowly

America Is Dying Slowly

Sunz of Man, Gambinos, forever...
Keep it safe!
Ol Dirt Schultz, word up baby
Protect yourself!

Comin' to get this money, money
Knock, Knock nigga
Aiyo, aiyo


I be where the dough at and where the dough at, a ho at
I grind for real, y'all niggas know that
Cause slow money's better than no money
I keep a hustle, strong-arm block muscle
Hand me those things, what's poppin' my nigga?
Po-po watching again
Put the heat and the work in the stash, Fatty got us
I wish somebody would try to rob us
Them bootleg CDs, two for five dollars
Advances, leather 
I'm gettin' my dick sucked by belly-dancers
All hood, yeah, pop got the gambling spot back
Roll up a wood, smoke berries, my team 'bout paper
At first you don't succeed, strive again
That Gin and Grapefruit, rockable blend it's grown B.I
Brownsville, all the way to Portland, you know us
The ice don't melt but it felt like you know us
Yeah, you go under the ground
If you didn't know me then Pa, you knowing me now
I been poppin' those and them ho's been knocking those
Shows outta state, West bubble fuck
With big hummer trucks, gangsta life, live big
That's my word to Big, I send shots to your ribs
See if you can spot the red beam
I'm parked right in front of the spot inside a red Beam', nigga


(Yeah, yeah, we'll pass this off)
Yeah we got this pick up
After we pick this up everything gon' be good
(Watch yaself)
Yo watch those two cats over there
They funny facin' right now, they funny facin'
(I got that)


I started out workin' a ho, moved up to a runner
Hustled for material wealth, put bullet-proof tires on the Hummer
Straight to ya gate I deliver, flow like the Kwantung River
Murdered for a few tails of silver
Code:Red, swingin' on ya head, it's all actual, the murder capital
Group emcee killers, masters, pros and villains
Mic snatchers, dark like a hatchet
Flash ya ratchet, whether steel or plastic
Check the regiment
Peace to Almighty Infinite from the Desert
What's the science Wu-alliance?
On the Ave, I heard son got stabbed up at the party
Never, the God too clever
He seen it comin', they thought he was slippin'
'cuz he's rockin' a drunken', hand on his gun and
Eyes red ready to dead whatever movin'
Against the Armoured Truck, people that he moved wit'


Just make sure my money's right, how I move
(Yo the money's right)
The money there look easy, smooth and deadly


At the Plaza, high with her friends
She from Brazil and she likes men with Indian skin
How, the fuck are rap niggas goin' to trial?
Was that easy like burnin' an Owl or turnin' a dial
The body you do's, we body you dudes
We robbin' you, dealin' death and you outta ya shoes
Who's on first, now who's on second?
I'm on third, I'm not playin', them Ninas got 'em all prayin'
God please save me, them Brooklyn niggas, they all crazy
Both eyes hazy, now who the fuck want it?
We gamblin' grands, me and my mans
We got the block on watch for them D's in them vans
Now that's my word, that's my word
Twenty a gram, fuck that, thirty a bird
Flip somethin', respect the juks
This here's supposed to happen
Now who the fuck wanna start rappin'? Then start rappin'


Let's get this money
Divide it by the group
Divide by life niggas
On the grind, block for block
Whatever, whatever
Fort Knox, Knock, Knock, nigga
Timbo King, my nigga Dev One on the track
Definite on the Internet
Definitely, yeah, yeah
Bring it back..




There's no coke
What?
You heard me you dumb fuck, there's no coke
What the fuck do you mean there's no coke?
I've been up and down this ship
I've been in every fucking room
There's gotta be coke
There is nothing, nothing

*heavy panting*
Help PLEASE!
*panting continues*
Help me!
*gunshot*


It's assassination day, I stalk


I move through the Third World, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I live's a 25 to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
Cream is short, Cee Cipher Power stalk, plus the fiend talk
3 Gs the cost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen goal but it fail
Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter
Devil's poisoning the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened
Trapped in deep water, gasping
I clash with the titans for my half on the action


I stop producers careers, the weak spot was the ears
Scorpion darts hits the mark, pierce the heart with silver spears
You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still feel this so you're living build tilted
MCs upon their axis, their body hazard tactic
Lactic acid, desert dry cactus, practice
You can never match this invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice
The mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches
Unforgivable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects more livable
Interchangeable, caution: flammable
My chamber is 99 plus 1  unnameable angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
We creep through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare


First of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don
Spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurging, merging in the suburbs
Using this just like an adverb, action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aiming like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pa
You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Holding like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high, yo Bobby
You hear how I'm shooting it like they blue tops
No, you won't play me like your lady
Pay me 380, spit it at you like a baby, final destination Haiti


War's extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take things to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MCs to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue death than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in
Murderous rhyming, constantly inclining
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain then absorbs the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback






Listen; calm nerve with the best herb
Meditation good for the mastermind expansion
Nothing diluted or tampered
Rhyme raw, you snort it'll make your nose bleed
My words on paper take shape and form
Killarmy's that bomb atomically, you've been warned
Your family will mourn the lose, you rap wannabees
Testing the true MC, why risk it?
You're better off slicing your wrists, don't miss
You shoot you better hit me
Peace to my brother Slick original foundation
Stack brick like a master mason, when I build
Real ill like an NFL skill drill still
Yo 9th, let's snatch about 10 mil and chill


Me and my nigga 9th Prince hopped off the cactus
Hit out Jerus', all crazy and hostile
Gotta watch out for the pop out boys they might pop you
Stop on any block, twist 
Honies everywhere, yo the Gods is Power
Half the floor's on something, slip in the bar
Killa hill Army, yo take a flick of the stars
Champagne in the spotlight panties and bras
Educated rich black kids, with scars
At the Farrakhan march yo the world is ours
The glitter, all in my family, the trucks and cars
Never dumb black people, thoughts travel to Mars
Then we add on to life by constantly elevating
Avoid the bitch niggas that's out there ovulating


Just something know, this is my life and



Egyptology try not to acknowledge thee
Verbal biology biochemical poetry
Stroll the streets, black Jesus looking for a Judas
Heirs appointed hazardous to your brain not to pursue this
I open up your imagination like George Lucas
And leave the microphone spinning like a cyclone
Headed for the red zone
You niggas are fake, like titties with silicone
Make way, only a few can stay
Those that stray get sprayed with the AK
Western civilization psychology try to follow me
Demolish me. me and my Killarmy
But I'm in tune with the universe like I study cosmology
Killah with the flow is my policy
Raise your flag is this hip-hop democracy
Here I come hear the sounds and feel the vibration of my drums
African descendant, transcendent
My evolutionary origin begins
Way back when scientists started figuring
The 9th Prince has no beginning or ending
Rappers still pretending, and selling niggas the illusion
Where's the contribution, I rewrite the Constitution
Cappadonna, my persona's filled with honor
The 9th Prince carry on the Wu-Tang Saga






Give me the cue


Skip the introduction proceed to lip function
The junction get rushed by some grimy people busting weed
Splatter your melon like some Attica felons
Use a firearm good, Bloods go for heart swelling
Insert the spasm, yes the dirty herb has him
Thoroughbred thugs insert the fantasm
Verbal smarts, spark the word, visit my scripture
Exotic wine, holding nine Picasso pictures
When the rhyme pivot you now, limit your chance
Bodyguard the lyric with unlimited stance
Words seem to zing on down to Beijing
When we touch down, would you crown renowned kings


There's no honor amongst thieves
Street pharmaceutical stack like Genovese
The Four Devils tempt madmen but not these
We profound hardcore sound to MCs, thumbs down, prepare
Killa bees it be warfare, this the year
Niggas gotta take you off of here, hold the square
If we go there we go gritty and spread fear
Through this rap city, call the mayor
My razor sharp darts be like cold stares
The smell of fear make my nostrils flair, truth or dare?
Ask yourself can you compare to these niggas in the hood
Johnny B. Goode or he be gone yeah
The struggle goes on, you've been warned
PLO from here to Lebanon, how many bomb
Must we drop in the Ninety-Now?
Walk a mile in my shoes, get the street news from Meth-Tical


Glocks'll be spitting, you gots to be kidding
Aiyo kid you gots to be kidding
Or Glocks'll be spitting
You gots to be kidding yo


It's common sense how I master my circumference, you dense
I get locked the fuck up, released on my own recognizance
Can't be judged, young bloods bust back like scuds
Wu-Tang hovers one thousand notches above
MC level, yo, I stay highs like treble
Foes who oppose get plucked like rose petals
Arresting and holding, penetrate forbidden regions
Wack MCs only lasting one season
The morale was low at the corral
Adjective pronouns had no style, your weak proposal
Aim for the official, initial is Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah
All that other bullshit ain't permissible
Annual increase of the Wu-Tang Manual
Handles to keep all this Hip Hop shit tangible
Illegible, every egg ain't edible
My tracks remain 'Unforgettable' like Ol' Nat Cole
Got to catch this paper to buy Shaquasia a glacier
Nebuchadnezzar skyscraper
Understanding the continents of Africa and Asia
And free the Black Man from enslaved labor, Wu-Tang


The weight of the fam is on our back and we can't fall
Victim to this long hall of fame, meaning nothing
We came to punish the glutton with a substance
That can't be contained, Wu-Tang


Motherfuckers
We be seeing y'all asses when we walk up in the club
Y'all all in the back
Scared to speak, we speak cause you scared
Punk motherfucker, we know what time it is


All you been seeing is upsets in the boxing shit, right
It's like come on man
This nigga fucked up motherfucking Whitaker
Dang, he caught Whitaker
He caught Whitaker a long time ago
Mike got touched
Then Mike got touched by Holyfield
Hey Mike's, Mike's gonna forfeit this fight
He ain't fighting McDermit
He ain't fighting
Nope
Whattup
You talking bout he, what he, what he, what he did
Told them he cut his eye, in sparring


Stella D'oro wrap breadsticks, David Berkowitz
Einstein birthed a hit, now nurture it
M.G.M. front row seat tonight, no gems
Purify, cleanse, ran into some beef up in the men's
Fix your sawed off, Wu-Tang tore me off the cross
All you saw was white meat, skin hanging off
These is words from the Arch Bishop, some call it six up
The Betty Crocker Marvel cake, snakes will miss a
Wax janitor, black Jack Mulligan from Canada
Slam dance, tarantula style, you's a fan of the
Monopoly king, Slavic poetry
Carnegie Hall's off the hook, let's push through the armory
Mack truck hitting soloist, Soul Controllers
Behold of the thousand teeth fist, swift and boneless


You know cause Wu-Tang is invincible, you know what I mean
It's Wu-Tang Forever God
We gonna get down with that W
You gonna get down with that W
That's that Wu, that's that Wisdom
That's the Wisdom of the Universe
That's the truth, of Allah, for the Nation of the Gods
YouknowhatI'msayin
We breaking egg through these days God
YouknowhatI'msayin
We got the fucking way
We got the medicine for your sickness
Out here, ya knowhatImean
I was telling Shorty like
Yo Shorty, you don't even gotta go to summer school
Pick up the Wu-Tang double CD
And you'll get all the education you need this year
YouknowhatImean
Their poisoned minds can't comprehend this shit
Word man it's Wu-Tang Forever God
Niggas can't fuck with these lyrics God
YouknowhatI'msayin
Knamean
Oh hell no, none of this shit
C'mon man -- beats, lyrics man, y'all niggas
Niggas can't even understand half this shit
I think niggas ain't gonna figure it out til the year Two-G
(Wax niggas ass for free or fee) Word
Yo, you know what
The next Wu-Tang album ain't even coming out until 2000
YaknowhatImean
That's just gonna come back with a comet
You hear, we gonna bring a comet
Check for that shit in the millenium
YouknowhatImean? So, yo, y'all niggas man
Be the resurrection
The Gods is here man
Born Gods is here








Let's take it back to the blacktop
Mags on le Donna
When the boom box hittin' bong
I play your position
Know the ledge got some juice now
40 ounce get loose now
Holler at some crazies
That believes the other crew's sound stealing
Gold chillin heads up to the ceilin'
Constantly revealin' hip hop Will ya stealin'
Through the veins and the buzz stream the goat scream
Enough cream gunnin' 
For a million, keep 'em comin
Back for more, reservoir dog raw
With the raw bagged up under the floorboards
Pure uncut dope, unmarked bills
Bad gold cables and the  grills
Drop top Mercedes with the shiny chrome rims
See hip hop was even bling bling back then
Don't think for one point materialism's new
Just because you ain't acknowledge the old school
True I'm livin' understand every   a livin'
Gave birth to a wizard, 
On a mission goin day by day
While we hood I'm God playin' , play by play

Now pray



{Pull out your money
Pull out your cut
Money, bitches, cars, clothes and weed
(Money, money)
Even if I fail I land on a bunch of money}




{Pull out your money
Pull out your cut
Money, bitches, cars, clothes and weed
(Money, money)
Even if I fail I land on a bunch of money}


Guns and drugs and thugs hold it down in the slums
Smuggling crumbs, dope fiend bodies is numb
We might beat you it's stolen, we don't know where you're from
Got goons all around yeah, like over a 100
Sober and blunted, running now, soldiers is cunning
Moody was stubborn, even pull a tool on each other
Lay your house flat, leave with your cheese from your mousetrap
Then ride out back to the hideout where we count stacks
Papered up, fresh out the barber shop, tapered up
Hoes used to front on 'em but now they all vapoured up
Cake is us, this is good cush, take a puff
Must I remind you need a grinder just to break it up
Back to the murder plot, heard he got robbed
And flossers lied same night you heard he got got
A boss he was not, cross me and it's off with your top
Rock you with cops and trespassing and locking your blocks




My world winning lifestyle, never smile much
Nothing personal it's how we grew up
Ghetto life, city lights, corner hustlers who trying to escape it
Street violence where the weak won't make it
Recognizing life is real and currency is needed
But it gets taken if you can't defend it
Early manhood fast lane, slinging cocaine to make your ends meet
Mother weak younger song laying in the streets
Beat the murder charge acquitted
Bounce to the next state where they're rockin, bank stoppin everything
Heard him singing, contract on his head
Like Tommy Wink for real




Whether I'm rich or poor, I'ma still want more
I've been tryna maintain but I'm still hardcore
I be in the streets all day, 4 in the morning
See these all the time, I'm ignoring the warning
I'm a hustle hard nigga, you can hear my holler
Used to be into madness, yeah I came from under
I'm a project zero nights and all that fly shit
Plus I get it free, I ain't always gotta buy it
Fuck y'all niggas ya don't even gotta try it
I'm Mountain  AC, I feel like I'm retired
I'm a family man now and now I'm the wisest
I don't play no games, I keep my eye on the misers
Little children take notice, little niggas take note
Real niggas get paid but never end up in state clothes




There are no words to describe what I see with my eyes
They brains are fried, they just be believing the lies
They locked up inside the law, always talkin' bout they hardcore
Nigga you ain't even inside cyber secure
Til I bust down your door with a 44 inch chainsaw
Force your jaw, pitch like a claymore
I don't give a fat rat's ass about the price of that gas
I'm already strapped for cash
Lake Placid swamp gator habitat
Canibus Brad Pitt World War Z bugout bag kiss
Capricorn Asian pass
M-Eighty in the Situation Room talking to the top brass
50 magnification
100 millimeters looking at the space stations workin' out the equations
Sinkhole black hole bubblin' Cajun, tough as the raven
My jumbo gumbo gumbo taste it
Nothing can save him, face it, you suckers wasted
Soldiers sold, now you havin' trouble with the payments
La lay loo lay lo with Lupe's laces
Ain't no little geegaws uncreate my creations
That's why I keep pace with energies beyond my displacement
Hoping to give faith to the faithless
20 gold shillings with the illest of the Almighty siblings
In the village organizing the pillage, niggas



I've taught you for three years instructing you in my Poison Clan techniques. We live here in seclusion so we can talk about the clan. The point is I had pupils once. Is that a fact? What are there names? Where are they? I don't know their names now. When they left they all took new names, as the whole idea was to keep their identities a close secret. So even they don't know each other's names. And while they were here they always wore masks to avoid being known. I worry about what there all doing. What I taught them could be used wrongly for evil to hurt men. So then I would like to make sure this hasn't been the case and you will do that for me. Teacher, how will I find them if they've changed their names? And to make it harder they won't show their skills they'll keep them hidden unless it is an emergency. If bad you must kill them




Brain, brain, brain, brain
Brain, brain, brain, brain
Brain, brain, brain, brain
Brain, brain, brain, brain


Heh, yo, party people gather round, watch the God get down
The sound's so rugged, measure the erection
It's raw when I'm sexin' your brain
Cherry cream beam leather seats, lean
Goose in the canteen, dutch leaf green
Block wit a chocolate, ship a mil', box it
Moms and pops it, plan to be seventy five, live and kicking
Jewels drip in the heat, rippin' with a young sweet
Something in the passenger seat
Ivory Queen Bee got the Old Man feeling twenty three
Power-U fat as a peach, I'm Chief Jay Strongbow
From the east, come due Allah, what a beautiful squall
Through the Cartier tints, I seen her from afar
She in her mink trench in her panty and bra
Smooth in silk, naturally built, soy milk breast
Gas at the 'hess, slit it to the rest, undress






Come and get some, you want none
Y'all niggas wanna bring it, get done
Flashback, '88 rag type Volvo
One court solo, slash for logo
200 hyenas roam the arena
Schemin on a truck Chevy, quick to rush every
Criminal mental, satanic pen pal
Wild style on your wax for ten thou'
Most notable, Hip Hop quotable
See many went, only one got a show to do
Floor soakin wet with the drinks and dance sweat
Tell me which click got the deadliest handset
I make the mic pump, force make your feet stomp
Murderous beats move like rope for you to jump
And the two-inch, tighten with the wool-wrench
None qualifyin ass-niggas, the Jon Bentz
Spend it real, 'nuff festivals on the grill
Got a deal, no return with the Brook Shield


Breaker, Breaker 1-9, can't rhyme
Y'all niggas wanna shine, get offline


Yo, I use and abuse all groups and crews
I can't lose, straight up and down, I'm bad news
Like the bears, we folks from under the stairs
Pack a hand trigga, scared niggas don't dare
From the rear, I smash through like a John Deer
Plant a bomb in ya ear then disappear
With a speed that'll reach mach five
Niggas pop jive, that's why they on the opposite side
Dick riders tryin to make their way inside
Boy analyze, my camp be amplified
Certified live, right before your third-eye
Supply the mental high for the fiendish
Thru the intervenus, see it like a wide-screen Zenith
Got sweetness, wanna show me your cleavage
Leave it to the specialist, leave your wig split
Leavin no witness, it's a mean business
We mean business, invest in cream
Till my exit scene, I stay plottin on my next scheme


Next scheme
Blessed with the art to pierce and shoot dart
I toke the bass, put your shovel to the Rebel
Allah Just, embrace his face with the metal
Danger, woman adore to the chamber
Let this nigga run out wild with the banger
Hip Hop socialize, enterprise, snubs in the club
Twenty wizards, about 300 niggas inching your square
Or could it be the armory?
Fifty-two low hand, touch the ground
Strike his knee, pass the heat to my man
Windmill backhand bust your nose gland
Mic stand, might crash a wild fan
The Aqua, city of Atlantis, mantis, flying locusts
Surround the oppose, a bomb only has one time to explode
I blow and break and quake your whole state
Throw the shit on DAT, and make me a fuckin tape






Ol' Dirty kickin' your ass
The things that you learnt in class, is trash
You can't do nothing with it, I put you in the past
The pilgrim muthafuckas -- shut the fuck up!
I do it to you bad luck, the hair get plucked
The only thing on your brain is to give me this cash
And stay out of business, cuz I'm takin' your cash
This world belong to me, none of y'all free
I got y'all in -- slavery
The habit of breathing, the hope to find
That you're misbehaving, Link your Cuban
Fuck your booing, flash the burners
On your crewing, cuz I'm much different from
The other M.C.'s, I got the amazing ability
I get on the mic, so you can have a ball (break that break)
I can fly through the air and stick to the wall
I can take a punch, or get hit by a car
Could go to the nearest or farthest star
As a matter of fact, that's what I won't talk about
How I'm going outer space, just to be in the house
How I'm going outer space, ---- -- be in the house


Break that break (nah-nah-nah-nah)


I'm that mic enhancer, the beat programmer
When Ason Unique speak, he throw hammers
And we go bananas over old school breaks
I take an old school loop and break it on yo face
I start from a clean slate, bang you on the waistline
Deep Space Nine, Math smash the bass line
I break spines, til they fraction or splinter
I want Michael Jackson money, just a fraction of Thriller
Deep in, the laboratory, manufacture the Zilla
Cock, notch category, capture the realer
We the ex-drug dealers, still serving them fiends
With TV's in the car, the size of movie screens
You know the routine, give 'em what they need
That disco shit, satisfaction guaranteed




Yeah, 1-2-3, microphone check
In the place to be, as you can see
This is Wu-Tang Clan guest starring M.C
With no harm intended, nobody offended
Carry on with the social, nothing but a party tonight
Special invite, ladies free before midnight
We lock the club down, clash sound hear the guns pop
See D.J.'s spin, counter clock, keep gridlocked
Line around the block, women by the flock
Wanna party with the great, I reap Jamel
Ring bells throughout the state
Diggin' in the crates, for the old school
Remix, nice it up for the people
Ladies want the hardest stiff, to spread eagle






Bobby, I'm tired of yo' shit, nigga!
I'm tired of you comin' in at 3 o'clock in the mornin'
Nigga, you got a family here
You act like you don't fuckin' know that shit
Nigga, what the fuck?

Born up in Kings County


Digital, these niggas should be crazy
Growin' up as a Brooklyn baby
This how, this is my life..


Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo, YO
A Brooklyn baby, I was born up in King's County
Inside the womb seven months before the Queen found me
Up in wroughty Brownsville with fiends around me
Now roam gat in Staten with Cream Team around me
They called me Bobby, Cousin Billy got the black Harley
Taught his son how to snipe cats like Lee Harvey
Oswald, all's well that ends well
My big brother Divine, he pushed the Benz well
I got the cherry Range, known for rockin' heavy chains
I'm from the tribe of men who would bury Kings
On the back of the A-train, my daydream
Should I make a phat hit or should I take CREAM?
From the Clan that taught you cats Cash Rules
I make slow grind tracks, you grab ass too
Give respect to the Prince when he pass through
Might have a chocolate deluxe in a glass shoe
Cousin Billy, known to strap the black uzi
Shoot you in front of the Jakes like Jack Ruby
Live on TV where you see B-O-B-B-Y
D-I-G-I-T-A-L (A-L!), things ain't too well




Digital, these niggas should be crazy
Growin' up as a Brooklyn baby
This is how I live my life..


Yeah..
Peace Lafyetee, Stuyvessant, Malcolm X
Shot dice on green, we live from Pulaski y'all
It's Fred Glassy, zig-zag-zig through traffic
Get the herb, get the God, peace Ra'
What's the word on things?
Through the phone I heard the bangin' sounds
In the background, layin' down
I'm spittin' what the people missin'
We extreme with the murder type theme
Don't sleep, get ya head split to the white meat
Big guns, down South we blaze
Shippin' bodies back up North, it's the Weston
Wild Texan, no trespassin'
Long mics hit the dead arm
Planet Earth, home of Islam
Brooklyn, I was physically born, clothes torn
Rough tacklin' the streets, Allah Math' spin techniques
We bring heat to the block party, drinkin' Bacardi
Baggin' shorties for the homies who ain't here




Bobby, that's right, you ain't shit, nigga
You ain't shit, but a big dick and a mothafuckin' cheque
All that fuckin' Brooklyn shit, Shaolin shit
Nigga, grow the fuck up!
What the fuck is up with you, nigga?
You ain't shit, nigga
Comin' in high off that shit
What the fuck?
I'm tired of yo' shit
What the fuck is that shit anyway?
What the fuck?
And your cousin Billy, I'm sick of that mothafucka
That mothafucka could never come up in this
Mothafuckin' house ever again
He's a criminal mothafuckin' gangsta, see that shit?
A criminal, I'm sick of that shit
I'm sick of yo' shit, Bobby 
Brooklyn this, Shaolin that
What the fuck, nigga?
I don't know why I love your stupid ass anyway
Pssh.. but I do love you Bobby

Brooklyn King that'll snatch your Bling

Well protected, Heart rip cage chest is solar plexus
Rugged Profile peep honey child checkin' my style
Quick Wallets are fuck, slick wit it talk, East New York
Get a guns buck, back them down
You know the sound, when they see auto spit fully
Baron Bully, Timberland Boot, Black Hoody, Fitted Black Skully
You still on that bullshit, I can't get it out of me
Why should I switch the Prescription ?
The Whole World vibin' to what I'm Prescibin'
Keep the Jam livin'

Tell Universe to love and scent
Missed seein' him on the Ave. a little longer and bent
Yea it's another day in the Hood
I got my Money from the Block
Now I'm gon' cop somethin' fly
To rock for the rest of the Week
Prefer heart, not the drop slippin' of to the beat
Not the sweet smellin' sex in my Passenger seat
Pretty feet on my Dashboard sippin' her drink
Pretty Brown Eyes, Pretty Brown Thighs
All Wise Intelligent Eyes
See you spread Butterfly, Pretty ass high
Slang Supreme Marble, I beat the Terrible Reign
Dirty South, Carolina Game, cockin' again
Hear the Guns bust, can be spittin' like this
High risk for MC's vocal anesthetic for your head Rush

Now you see how the Crowd response when I get on
You'll neva last in this Square when I enter
Brooklyn - also known as Good Lookin'
Crooklyn - slidin' through your Central Bookin'
Knocked on the felony charge that got dropped
So I copped po' basin' wit the Five year pendin'
Can't count the Blessin'
Caught another case in the mix, Now I'm stressin'
Power to the People to Sequel, spark the people
See you at a Town near you, Comin' WU

Yeah, you know
The problem with most of these niggas nowadays
They ain't got no respect
See, life ain't just about all that other shit you lookin' at my nigga
You know, I love it on the Westside
That's why I pose with the homies, we smoke, drink, raise kids and make this motherfuckin' money
You hear me?



My killa Cali gangsters a ride for me
Got brothers in the bay that'll die for me
Got the best weed smoke choke no seeds
Mexicans, crip, blood we all one seed
Shout the game, Snoop, Cypress Hill, B Real and real soldiers
Like Pac I still Feel
So I still ride dirty with the 5th steel
Got Kurupt young gotti with the semi shotty
My brother Power in the Maybach counting big money
The Cali sunshine but it ain't all sunny
Brothers dieing everyday and I pray for them
Falling soldiers in my heart where I still hold them
I feel I owe them
My brother coming home
On parole looking swoll
Young and old time to get gold so let's roll
These words that I write and recite is from the soul



Indo weed, extra green
Texture, extra, orange and green
Next to Inspectah Deck it seems
The reala Masta Killa and young gotti
I got to hit New York and push pass the kush hash
Big Snoop and Daz want to push past
Indo weed, and feeling fine
I'mma do this shit as well then again at nine
See, I'm cut from a different cloth
Got it? Got it?
I'm cut from a different cloth
Bodyguard hard, you niggas are soft
See you niggas ain't loyal
You don't know how stay down and play your position
Get a new fitting
Fitting the function, you's an undercover clown
I was born to push a concrete line
I change lives, I enhance my eyes
I'm Magneto, Magneto, aniyo
The one that can pose the metal at all times
If you look, you find
Close eyes to blind
Look




Wait, hold up, chill, what's that, son?
Damn nigga got fucked, shit, huh?!
By his back, watch nigga run
Seven the center of your eight point Sun
Hold tight grip on the God-U Now, you best be careful!
Can't dodge two Self-Hes aimed at your domepiece
Father-U-C-King police!!


Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum
Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum


Yo, Rae it's been a long time son since we bust gun
Clap glaciers, ran the world and snatched paper
Return to the 36th Chamber
Proceed with caution as you enter
We have an A.P.B. on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a master


Yo something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang thang
Something in the street went BANG BANG..


Up in the boss game wilding, money for grabs
I ain't fucking with crabs, out of state copped two labs
Hopped two cabs, back on the Ave
Stab you with the vocab, catch me at the big dough rehab
Tryna re-up, keep my feet up
Snake niggas in the cut, hold the product
Time is up, no luck, heat start to bust
Niggas you can't trust, dealing with lust
Seen him at the ballgames with James


Something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang thang
Something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang


Something in the hall went 
The boxcutter went 
Something in the hole went 
The boxcutter went 


These are the bones, bones from the grave of Houdini
G-Deini, Ronzoni noodles sprinkled on your embry'
Climb like the deficit, profits, death threats
To Israel slid through Bethlehem bong on one wheel
Syringes, rubber bands, needles, the 60's
Granddaddy Caddy was copping 6 G's
B'gosh all that Oshkosh jumpers
Pink Champelle, brown paper bags, wall to wall bumpers


These ain't the camera guys, cause, turn your eyes
Sweat on the hammer fly, Ways of the Samurai
Newsflash bulletin, Gods on the prowl
We full again, ruff men scuff Timbs
Sonic bionic lens, RZA console
Is it Bush or the Dole, front row of the Superbowl
Black gold in my soul, on a ho stroll
Don't go boy you on parole you don't know?


Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK


Made 'em throw they hands up but then lay flat
Rat pack eat up, the average alley cat
Prepare for the impact when we contact
Known to drop facts that crack your hard hat
Must I show and prove, trust I, bust I
Make your head spin like chrome 20's on the buggy-I Benz
Who contends, Wu like the Superfriends
Who's your rhyming hero? Wu-Tang rules again


Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK


Yo something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang thang
Something in the street went, BANG BANG..


Something in the hole went 
The boxcutter went 
Something in the hole went 
The boxcutter went 


Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum
Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum




Let it flow, deh-deh-duh (yeah)
It's on (beh-deh-deh-deh)
(Den-e-neh) on... (yo, aiyo)


Keep on knowing what you know
Keep on knowing what you know
End up, up, up, in chains, chains, chains


Back in '88, son was getting a little paper
Caught a few stings, rocked the phat rope cables
Pushed the white Mercury Sable, known for holding heat
Ferragamo moc's on his feet, serpents whisper
You can smell the deceit, they greet me like peeps, to blend
And try to befriend, to get up, underneath the skin
My long wind'll blow ya head piece degrees
Murder One Team, Barcelini Noodle had lean
Microphone fiend, step into the rhythm
This is how I'm serving them, no need for medic attention
I just murder them, murder them, pussy, I just murder them




I'm a dip-dip diver, socializer
I'm a who flat top rule, in eighty niner
They say "Rugged, by now you should have at least blown"
It's funny, I'm mad famous for being unknown
I'm just a dirty motherfucker, they hate my guts
All I talk about is bitches, and busting nuts
Yeah, I got a foul mouth, yeah, I cuss too much
I'm just so Ricky Ricardo, ridiculous
And I ain't got no fly whip, I still ride the bus
I got Mitch Blood Green on the scene with us
Hospitable, hitable, cooler than digable, criminal
Miracle, lyrical, take every syllable literal
It'll riddle, profitable, visible, iritibal
Little brittle pitiful fists will do little but tickle, you typical
Yeah, I talk shit, I'm cocky with it
It's hard for you to admit it, but I'm one of the best in it




My mind is haunted, filled with the extension of slaves that's torment
Slow down my steps, one foot from the grave to con it
Our young black males, they lick pon gate
Sun of the morning roasted souls, tell Minister "come pray"
It's gun trade inside of smoky apartments
Flow process, one nine, two tech, four revolvers
Coke overboiling kettles, it's like we struck oil in the ghettos
We supply it to addicts, the devil work
He practice, he's like a search backwards
Til they throw that dirt in our casket, and that's it
I live where the fiends are nothing, just a scene of the projects, similar to
Osama's
An old man, at the top of the stairs, he just stare
Cuz his mind ain't there, victim of the war
Polar signs, the times is near
He drop the jewels, til you buy him a beer
He said he was a linebacker for the Bears
Said he did it all back, while he's drying his tear
Yeah, it's that real shit, that made me
That music from the '80's, the child's of the '70's
I live long til they bury me




I must tell you that the Clan is a danger to the public
But still for many men just to hear of the name
Fills them with hate and loathing
But why? They've never harmed anyone
I'm afraid they did
*beat drops*
In the past there's something that they would like to forgive
First, I'll tell you about their style, planned techniques
The main style
"Shaolin Finger Jab!"


Yo..
*sounds of fighting*
(Uh-huh)


We are watchin your whole group
You been busy here
Around the clock, all we need is your orders to move
Met a lot of crosses last night
Young and old!
You been busy here
I respect that!


Yeah, (Eh yo), yeah
Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in (Yo)
Come on! You know what it is
(Thou must bust shots all the time, kid)
(Eh yo, eh yo, eh yo) We're back!


Peep The Jump Off, ain't nothin sweet, get dumped off
Frontin like you won't get deaded and bumped off
Drastic son, master guns that'll run up in plastic ones
And then go, crash in the slums
One tight army, few good men that'll rep
Invade you strongly, Prince of Wales swimmin on feet
Props'll sell, all yellow L's, cops sleepin on nails
Niggas get realer than real, yo
Flash the brown, last time was crowned
All navy Woolridge, Wu kicks, movin them pounds, yo
Last on niggas, great adventures of my niggas
And Castro pictures, sendin a rash out the kitchens
Like the wind, invite the grin, watch niggas rewrite the trend
Wu niggas did it again, yo
Unhighly, octane, die cast metal frame
Lame, let another man with heat handle beef


Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in


Yo, spark the intro, relevant info
Load up the keyboard, 105 tempo
Most heated battles, I've blasted MCs
Some said that the bullets flew by like angry bees
Wu entered on the level where we would wait and listen
While one flashed metal, eight calculate position
The world snapped, once we combined our rap
Drastic measures, priceless treasures on Nap'
Our swords swing, windchill Mount Aerie
Native plant standin' on the tall-grass prairie
Snares and kicks, off the project bricks
It's no act the producer played the role with drumsticks
The warning came unnoticed
It's like the shot on the dock of the bay
That slayed Otis, the Nine-Lotus
Each one adjust to his own environment
Formulate this great LP, a hundred rounds spent
Niggas bent on the fruitless search for nourishment
They long for this proper guidance, encouragement




It be the Lost Tribe, 7 days locked in the dungeon
Foamin at the mouth, mad dog in this production
The uncontrolled substance got me spittin up bars disgustin
The last temptation of the son of David Ruffin
Hold my mic sideways when bustin
On Judgement Day runnin through Hell, yellin and cussin
At MC's in my circumfrance, y'all niggas hand-cuffin
These hoes and ain't read them they rights or nothin
Keep lustin, yeah and I'ma a keep hustlin
With Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in
You know me, everytime you kiss that ho you blow me
You blow trial trin to walk a mile in my Sauconys




We just touched down, Wu shuttle, private jet
Stepped off the plane, the world wept
Roll with the Witty Unpredictable
Talent All Natural, rock with the beatles of hip-hop
Mathematical imperial manifestation of greatness
Make wiz's scream and shout at the top of their breath essence
Captured on tape is precious
Bless mic pure deafness, awaken from you sleep mistake
When the God bring rain, hail, snow to the earthquake




You've been busy
Are you mastered?

You've been busy here..




A game of chess is like a swordfight:
You must think first before you move
Toad style is immensely strong
And immune to nearly any weapon
When it's properly used it's almost invincible


Raw I'ma give it to ya, with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
Like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MC's approach with slang that's dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushin' force, my force you're doubtin'
I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains


Well, I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary and carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum, and the isle I'm from
Is comin' through with nuff niggas and nuff guns
So if you wanna come sweatin', stressin', contestin'
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk
I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain, there's no way to barricade me
Steamrollin' niggas like an 18 wheeler
With a drunk driver drivin', there's no survivin'


Rough like Timberland wear, yeah
Me and the Clan in 'Yota Landcruisers out there
Peace to all the crooks, all the niggas with bad looks
Bald heads, braids, blow this hook
We pack chrome TEC's, nickel-plated MAC's
Black AC's, drug-dealin' styles in phat stacks
I only been a good nigga for a minute though
'Cause I got to get my props and win it, yo
I got beef with commercial-ass niggas with gold teeth
Lampin' in a Lexus, eatin' beef
Straight up and down, don't even bother
I got 40 niggas up in here now who kill niggas' fathers


My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Bees on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats


Here I go, deep type flow
Jacques Cousteau could never get this low
I'm cherry bombin' shits BOOM!
Just warmin' up a little bit, vroom vroom
Rappinin' is what's happenin'
Keep the pockets stacked and then, hands clap and then
At the party when I move my body
Gotta get up and be somebody!
Grab the microphone, put strength to the bone
DUH DUH DUHenter the Wu-Tang zone
Sure enough when I rock that stuff
Huff? Puff? I'm gonna catch your bluff tuff
Rough, kickin' rhymes like Jim Kelly
Or Alex Haley, I'm a Mi-Beetle Bailey rhymes
Comin' raw style, hardcore
Niggas be comin' to the hip-hop store
Comin' to buy grocery from me
Tryin' to be a hip-hop MC
The law, in order to enter the Wu-Tang
You must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang
Represent the GZA, Abbot
RZA, Shaquan, Inspectah Deck
Dirty Ol' gettin' low with his flow
Introducin' the Ghostface Killah
No one could get iller


My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats


Speakin' of the Devil, psych!
No, it's the God, get the shit right
Mega trife, and yo, I killed you in a past life
On the mic while you was kickin' that fast shit
You reneged, tried again and got blasted
Half-mastered-ass style, mad ruff task
When I struck I had on Timbs and a black mask
Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack
That night, yo, I was hittin' like a spiked bat
And then you thought I was bugged out, and crazy
Strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy
Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs
Never shot thugs, I'm runnin' with thugs that flood mugs
So, grab your 8 plus 1
Start flippin' and trippin', niggas is jettin', I'm lickin' off, son


Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang!


Homicide's is legal and death is the penalty
One justifies the homicide when he dies in his own iniquity?
It's the master of the Mantis Rapture comin' at ya
We have an APB on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a master
Evidence indicates that his stature
Merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
The flow changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like a lie, paralyzin' the victim
You scream as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Movin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
And injure any motherfuckin' contender


My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats




As we return to the 36 Chambers
The RZA, the GZA, the Ol' Dirty BZA
U-God, Chef, the Ghostface Killah
And Meth, Rebel I soldier for the foreclosure
Don't forget about the Masta yo


Motherfuckers halt when my Colt start stomping
Thunder strikes your land with the jolt
Your stamina level is low like currents from
The volts of relentless punishment that multiplies
At a speed that the naked eye can't detect
The infantry, peep the weapontry as I bomb atomically
Stagnant they stood surrounded and astounded
By this total square mileage of violence that I brung
I've not yet begun to stung, it's the ethics
And rigorous training methods of the Abbott
Incite oversees the opposition
Penetrates then infiltrates, breaking down your resistance
Leaving competition defenceless
Masta, Hip Hop antagonizer
Dumb, deaf and blind civilizer with the silencer


Piledriver Tut boulder face blow Hulk
Anger rap book causing chess blade smoke
Monster truck, punk, elephant gun poke
Jawbreaker humanoid vice grip, choke
Face the inferno, maestro pull it
Pipe hard slang, bite the golden bullet
Never, sold my soul Golden Arm cold stinger
See me on the streets address me stone bringer
Ease away, freeze back, feedback, play out in sweet
Action packed rap, bite it, stomp on the beat
Possess hollow head battle teeth Tony Atlas
Wu status now wisdom to the masses


Cock back my tongue like a hammer
My head is like a nickel-plated bammer
Spit .45 caliber grammar
At the speed of wind makes you bleed within
Crack your skull without penetrating your skin
Reign of champ official, Wu stamp with black pistols
Spent the weekend programming fat tracks at Camp Crystal


Home on the range, rebel with a pen
Writing critically acclaimed scriptures that do you in
Mr. Mef, Hot Nickels
Say my shit holding my sex pistol, deal me in


The bewildering Killa Bee quickly sting ya
I ain't gotta lift one fucking finger
Make sure the God Irief turns on the ringer
We ducking the subpoena
Fatal Flying Guillotine machine from Medina


Check the 150 millimeter heater
As it blows holes through your fucking speaker
(Makin you weaker creeping inches centimeters)
{Fifty caliber street sweeper
Shots from Shaolin that go to Massapequa}


Things'll never be the same after this one
Ghostrider spit flame, lay back and twist one
Recognize the Gods came for one accord
One mind and one common cause, that's the shit Son
Play them crows out position, you might hear me
But you don't listen, competition come and get some on
Red marker still bleeding through the paper
Of his sick premeditated murder caper


I walk with the Shaolin strut, burn a dutch
Watch Street eat 'em up, Cold Crush bum rush
Spot rusher get touched, bagged up, handcuffed
Y'all niggas can't fuck with us


Pass me the Black Velvet, embassy suite, killing me
Spell it, Maxi Priest caught me in a daze up on Delancey Street
Stand solar, deadly vengeance with a crowbar
It's like the dreads worshipping Jah, so Aloha
Pineapple crush, 850 swerve it with a rush
Plush the Canola Range spitting off the roof, holding my change
Yo it's ragtime, universal 12 Monkey mind
It's like stalking through your airport with a chunky .9


The underboss Staten New York
Bloodsport gun talk holding fort back, take 'em to court
It's the burner Shaolin bound face down you gets murdered
Roadblock shell shocked, stretched on a back block
Yo it's warfare when you ring here, slugs fly through mid-air
Landing thugs in wheelchairs from the slugfest
Keeps the iron, where the head rest for the conquest subway
Wordplay ricochet through your projects, crime pays
Matched up in a staircase in a dark place embraced
By the trey-eight, I'm in so deep I can't escape
These crime situations, I stay in man formation
A shot echoes through the ghetto locations y'all remain
P.L.O., slam cats like Bam Bam Bigelow
Throw a flow like Nomo, relate like Fidel Castro
I be the great all pro, hanging MCs by they logos
My street journal reacts and blaze like an inferno




We gon' take this back, crazy old school
Off the head one time, get a DJ something to a--
Chika-chika-chika-chika-chicka-chicka-chhhh
Get 'em something to scratch, yaknowhatimsayin?
My nigga Choco, Jam Master Jay on the 1's and 2's
Peace Allah Math, Red Alert, Marley Marl
Kid Capri, Funkmaster Flex and uh, Mr. Cee
I can't forget, Sway and Tech
Jazz Joyce, DJ Clue, Cocoa Chanel
Irief Jamel, I rocks the mic well, well
Rock the mic well, well, well..


On and on, to the break of dawn
Hot Butter on, say what? The popcorn
Freak 'em to the left, while we rock 'em to the right
Brooklyn in the house, who wanna fight?
Can we bounce? Roll to the skate, ya rock?
Hip to the hop and ya don't dare stop
Come alive party people, gimme what you got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
Fine, I'm the ninth member of the bunch
Rockin' old school ain't shit to me
MC's OD on the shit that I wrote
Can we smoke while I'm drinkin'? I'm thinkin' of bonin'
Sugar, I wanna ride yo ass until the mornin'
Leave ya moanin: Jamel Irief, High Chief, comin' outta East Medins


Ladies in the house if ya clockin' Gs
Sippin' on drink, Long Island Iced Teas
Lookin' real good from ya toes to ya weave
Tell the fellas back up and like let ya breathe
Fellas in the house if ya know ya live
Punch niggas in the face from Cali to Bed-stuy
Handlin' the steel if the shit get real
Just flip a pie and stack ya mil'


Activation, mind starts sparkin'
Constant elevation, sky walkin'
David Thompson, my Wu niggas stompin'
Down the boulevard, shakin' yo ass
You better watch yo self, I'm type slick
With a nice size --- lemme see you work it
She wanna suck it in public
Ol' Dirty Bastard can use it on the visitings, you wit it?
Then holla like wheels on a peel, don't squeal
Just keep it on the 'lils, for the Masta Kill
Just givin' you somethin' that y'all can feel
I see you in the hood, then ya fam from Tilden
Slid through the back of the buildin', heat concealed in
Stare to your place
Rae bomb the elevator, an Incarcerated Scarface, here, taste
The lace from the dominant race to the base
In ya face like paste, baby doll
Uh, uh, uh, uh, yes yes y'all
Welcome to the block party, shots lick off
You might wanna hit the deck, but stay calm
It's only us, every thing's still well plush
We freakin' the streets, the Shiek shows the beat 


One two, one two
I'mma try this one more time, son
Lemme in there, yo put that nigga back son
(Yeah, hit hard)


Like... hip hop, like socialize
Clean out ya ears and ya open ya eyes
Liquid Sword to the city
Peace Allah Just, that's one of the committee
Let's hook up the 6 for a chess contest
Relieve a little stress
I'll snatch a bag of the Uptown's best
Make ya love it when ya smell it
It's the velvet, block of chocolate for a hundred
Dread' got pounds, if ya wanna get down
Or we can catch 'em on the next round
My universal sound is like world reknowned
World reknowned, world reknowned
My universal sound is like world reknowned 





Feat. Ol' Dirty Bastard

Shit... thank you, thank you, thank you
Yeah, you see, when I think about soul music
There's a few people that I would like to mention
Brothers and sisters, solo or group
That had an effect on my life
I would like to begin by showing my utmost respect and love
To my universal soul sisters, beautiful sisters like
Chaka Khan, Aretha Franklin, Miss Millie Jackson
Patti LaBelle, Miss Betty White, Glady Knight
Tina Marie, and Miss Mary J. Blige
Soulful groups like, Isley Brothers, Blue Birth, Blue Magic
The O'Jays, Emotions, Rolls Royce, The Delfonics, Parliament, and the Jackson 5
Now, we gon' move on to my soul brothers
Soul brothers like, brother Barry White, Isaac Hayes, Curtis Mayfield
James Brown, Mr. Stevie Wonder, Al Green, Teddy Pendergrass, Marvin Gaye
The legendary Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, Rick James, bitch, and my man R. Kelly
Now when it comes to the soul, there's one more brother in particular
That I have to mention, and he just happens to be my brother Ason Unique
Known to the world as the Ol' Dirty Bastard
See if RZA would of threw some shit like this on
He would of went crazy and probably said something ill type
He would of probably said...


My beats slamming from the rugged programming
The man Bob Marley, hey my man, I'm jammin'
You can never test my stamina, while I'm ramming the
Hip hop crowd, make me rah rah rah
Other MC's got flipped with the ease, begging me for mercy, God, stop the music please
No, cuz I'm a pro, back to the convo, make the crowd say ho, at a strip show
Represent, his name is Ason, keep calm
Rhyme come smokey, funky like a stink bomb
Boom, blowing up niggas, mad bullets in the trigger
So you better run for cover!
Niggas got loose in they ass, felt the glass
A full account sprout, yo, yo, yo, money, yo pass
Woo, woo, woo, hospitalized
Is he gonna live Doc? No, the nigga dies
Maximum those MC's populating
Minimum those MC's I'm dominating
So all in together now, who, what, what, who
Rhyme come stinky like a girl poo


Hippa to the hoppa and you just don't stoppa
Hippa to the hoppa and you just don't stoppa
Hippa to the hoppa and you just don't stoppa
Hippa to the hoppa and you just don't stoppa


Yeah, yeah, yeah, you already
Aiyo, special love and dedication shout to Mama Cherry, we love you
Popa Wu, Brooklyn Zu, we already
12 O'Clock, 60 Sec., Murdock, Shit, Buddha Monk
Zu Ninjaz, and all the seeds, there seeds, whole family, man
You know it don't stop, stop, yeah
Yeah...




Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop


Cash rules everything around me, I'm fresh out the slum
Rich bum nigga, now I live dumb
Talking 'bout that cream
Leaning in the Tower of Pisa
Seven visas, got condos in the jungle
The mind stay rich but the pockets is well-filled
Let's violate this lil' area, get milk
I'm telling you, man, you don't want no part of this, fam
Get punched in the water like clams
KKK, slices, they one of the nicest
Stainless steel, sharp swords, dipped in ricin
Everybody eating, everybody full
Just a young bull lighting a Phillie, still a willy
Ball on 'em, in the Bentley with the wall on 'em
Yo, I'll sleep when I'm dead, like the hood, homies
Who get it cracking in the park, homes?
Park Hill narco, smoke and let the bones turn to charcoal
Let's get richer, kid
Signature Louis Rich, won't stop until there's billions in this bitch


Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop


I grew up on the rhyme side, that "gotta get mine" side
That white girl, we mix it with quinine
You players try and ball from the sidelines
While I'm aging like fine wine, you internet thuggin' somebody timeline
Between love and hate is a fine line
And these habitual line steppers can die trying
A New York Islander, my clique's NY Giants
A pocket full of NY (K)nicks for my clients
Y'all ain't buying, stop crying and stop lying
Hakuna Matata, no Mufasa, I'm not lion
You try to spit on that hot iron, you not iron
The irony 'cause that last shot just shot by him
So let's start it with this, son, motivate him with this one
If you ain't got no haters, go get some
Is anybody greater? There is none
Assorted 'Now And Laters', my clan got too many flavors to pick from


Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop


Deuce high when I start my game
It's like, you should see it live dog, all you see is sparks and flames
I grab bags and I park my ways, the way I have 'em all locked
You would think they gave they heart to bae
Bet on us, baby, ain't no better odds to play
It's hard to fake, my real life is on display
Either love or hate whatever part you play
I take the best of both worlds like R. and Jay
Own boss, no third party
Produce more murder than Irv Gotti
Like I'm working on my third body
Deck, kill it quick
24/7 bed rest, that's how ill it get
Can't stop if I mash the brakes
Got the cash it takes, I might flash my face
Half an eighth got me floating like I'm trapped in space
Not safe for your workplace, a basket case


Don't stop, never stop
Can't stop getting this guap
Fat money knot, hammer cock, curry hot
Cook a fool, hit the block
No shorts, bring it back
Flipping this, stack that
Free it up, weigh it up
Don't stop, never stop
Can't stop getting this guap
Fat money knot, hammer cock, curry hot
Cook a fool, hit the block
No shorts, bring it back
Flipping this, stack that
Free it up, weigh it up
Quest for success with my mind on my money
Came a new rhyme saying "Wu-Tang is the best"
Music
Yeah, peace to Khaled

Dialogue


Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop




Yo, this is a Wu-Banger two thousand and one noise maker
Off the hook guerilla anthem
This is DJ Kay Slay, from around the way
And I'll smack the shit outta ANY OF YOU DJ's
That front on this shit.. think I'm playin?

 (x2)
I heard you ladies got them thangs thangs, do you really?
I heard y'all niggas like to bang bang, do you really?


I never been a fan of the fame, I got love for the game
Never lust for the dames, I got dust in my veins
Little off in the brain, kid talks butter slang
Sniffed a little blow with the rap Eddie Kane
Spent a lot of dough, it's so hard to explain
And I fucked a lot of hoes off the strength of the name
Wu-Tang, see me at the next, X Winter Games
Snowboardin down a ski range, it's a blue and grey frame
Keep, pointin the finger, I'm that nigga to blame
The main reason why you tuck the chain
Self proclaimed, got a lotta profit to gain
And I'm leavin the rap game the same way I came


Now creep with me, as I roll through the Stat
Little Meth got my back, so do Pinky Fat-Fat
Let me hit that  contact, learn how to act
Before you bring that drama the end; now fade to black
Positive, hate kids who tell me lies
Despise guys that wanna get high but never buy
Got nine lives, nine wives that don't listen
Bitchin their biological clocks is tickin
Wu limited edition - hot off the presses
I guess it's, curtains for competition
Method, runnin 'em out, gun in my mouth
The kid your momma warned you about, tear down the house
After midnight, eatin MC's, change to a gremlin
You're tremblin, behind the Kremlin wall, surrenderin
That's what you get for Russian/rushin, in the direction I was bustin
Polish your sword, your shit is rustin

 (x2)
I heard you ladies got them thangs thangs, do you really?
I heard y'all niggas like to bang bang, do you really?


One-two, testin, testin, mic check wreckin
Steps into the session
Automatic weapon off safety, don't play me
But brings all them things with silencers
My clan is liver than your average '85er
Strive to stay alive
I play for keeps in the streets
Cause it's real on the battlefield
Shells hit the ground from the steel
Bullets travel, sun set fire to your mind
Words combine when I rhyme to free the blind
Prepare my queen for battle and walk down
I drink from the wine of violence, no tolerance
Gave word bond, sword silence
Me in military fatigues, bulletproof underneath
Buy enough ammunition to round and sweep the streets
Of Brooklyn, central, sugar-whipped the rental
While I'm lickin out the window at y'all, fuck y'all

 (x2)
I heard you ladies got them thangs thangs, do you really?
I heard y'all niggas like to bang bang, do you really?


Yo, we thrive on street life, we strive to eat right
They blind and need sight, we tried to be nice
They talk the small talk, we walk the long walk
We lost, they all thought, they forced to fall short
We rock for hard rocks, rocked the hot blocks
Shop and cop rocks, watch the top notch in action
Begin to make your head spin
Wu-Tang my brethren, we bang like veterans
They paid for record spins, taste the medicine
Or face the double M, we came to trouble them
Hustle them for they 20 mill' then buckle them
'Nuff to spin out the blue, bitches lovin them
Dozen men with force of a hundred-ten
Stumblin thug passions, it must've been

 (x4)
I heard you ladies got them thangs thangs, do you really?
I heard y'all niggas like to bang bang, do you really?




Out the window with that Range or that muscle car
Arm hanging out the window, diamonds in that big Chopard
Weed in the cracked cigar, more sour in the jar
Looking both ways, I'm cautious when I'm (drivin' 'round)
Hoodrats that's fresh, but barely feed their kids
Little kids that's killers and love doing bids
Unemployment lines, Mexicans'll work for nothing
You pray with them, but you don't know who that priest been touching
Liquour stores, strip clubs, filthy whores
Somebody daughter getting ten singles to drop her drawers
Crack fiends buy a new TV for 20 beans
Niggas tryna get money, police (drivin' 'round)
Blue flags, red flags, different gangs
OG's still outside, it never changes
McDonald's, chinese food, a thousand chains
I'm just tryna use my brains when I'm (drivin' 'round)


Step in the car and go
Round down by your lady, and I be waiting at the door
We 'bout to go (drivin' 'round)


Look, I'm fresh back from out of state, JFK arrival
A big spliff in my ashtray, July sunny day
And I'm feeling 'ight too, sliding through Medina
I done pushed everything, I love the way the Benz swing
So I turn my music up, caught a thought, wrote it down
I've seen him come back from outta town and get laid down
His music loud, windows down, summer heat vibing
It's live when I'm gliding, I'm smoking while I'm driving
Riding, mini skirts flirting while I'm passing, they waving
I'm leaning hard cruising, grooving to the beat
As I move through these mean streets
I beep at the seeds, stop, bless them with a little guap
I keep it rolling, picture me twirling the big truck
Yukon, my sheepskin shearling on the leather
It's a cold world, winter war weather
This is Wu-Block music for the black hooded champions


Step in the car and go
Round down by your lady, and I be waiting at the door
We 'bout to go (drivin' 'round)


What is the key to life, with no ignition?
Another jump start, then I'm on my mission
I keep ID, insurance, and registration
Wu music, good hemp for stimulation
Pull out the station, yield to pedestrians
Blacks, whites, Asians, Indians and Mexicans
At the light, a base head, fragile as a Pringle
He asks me "can I spare a change?" I throw up singles
He mimics my song that's on repeat
Addiction so strong, got him in knee deep
Button on his lapel, picture of Obama
Four years later we stuck in the same drama
These streets corners, just overcrowded saunas
Bigger losers drop weight, sweating from the trauma
Education to a thug is well debated
Each crime is kinfolk, all blood related


Step in the car and go
Round down by your lady, and I be waiting at the door
We 'bout to go (drivin' 'round)



"Do that dance, grown up" - sample repeated throughout the song


Turn my microphone up a little high..
Yeah.. yeah, yeah, look, party people gath-
Party people gather round
(Do that dance, grown up, do that grown up, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yo, yeah, yeah
Do that dance, grown up, do that dance, grown up
Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo, aiyo)


Party people gather round, watch the God get down
The sound's so rugged, measure the erection
It's raw when I'm sexin' your brain
Cherry cream gleem leather seats, lean
Goose in the canteen, dutch leaf green
Blocklet of chocolates, ship a mil', box it
Moms and pops it, plan to be seventy five, live and kicking
Jewels drip in the heat --


Radioactive, roll that accurate, what?
Roll that backward, flow went back
I stand as a man, the game plan repped your name
The greatest Fam, with grain of sand
Me and Irief, Killin gangsta thieves
Gangsta beats, civilize, great men don't make beliefs
Haagan-Daaz, shake the streets
I'm cocained down, and I got a fire to stretch my eats
West to East, South to North, best, the beats
Rest is tef', the Chef defeats
Order this piece -- yo..
Niggas who ain't real, they real when they call the police, my brothers
Watch the slang, lots of lame, pop your frame
And drop your dame, and chop your name
We locked the game, '89 niggas with oxes on us
In front of the building with the same thing


Uh-- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, get your uh-uh-uh-uh
And... (do that dance, grown up, do that dance, grown up)
Look, look, huh, look, huh, party people gath-
Party people gather round
(Do that dance, grown up, do that dance, grown up)


Party people gather round, watch the God get down
The sound's so rugged, measure the erection
It's raw when I'm sexin' your brain
Cherry cream gleen leather seats, lean
Goose in the canteen, dutch leaf green
Blocklet of chocolates, ship a mil', box it
Moms and pops it, plan to be seventy five, live and kicking
Jewels drip in the heat, ribbon with a young sweet
Something in the passenger seat, I greet queen
Bee got the Old Man feeling twenty three
Power-U fat as a peach, I'm Chief Jay Strongbow
From the east, come due Allah, what a beautiful squall
Through the Cartier tints, I seen her from afar
She in her mink trench in her panty and bra
Smooth in silk, naturally built, soy milk breast
Gas at the Hess, slid into the rest
Undress ya'll, and you don't stop, come on!


Do that dance, grown up (come on)
Do that dance, grown up


Yo, I got muscles in my index finger, even my nail is diesel
To scope two, so I could read you
Without a jack, there, I'm still hittin' up people
You were starvin' for beef, I had to feed you
It's funny how Toney got a lot of sons around
Nice dirty crib, with a lot of guns around
Layin' up in Cheetah's, chillin'
Treatin' niggas like cavities, lead rocks'll be in your filling
Bosses, C.E.O.'s, head niggas in charge'll get whacked
Actors, even down to the stars'll get clapped
Skip back, I'm not a bullshit rapper
My gun really do go off like that
This is Ghost, high post, get your pot roast coked
When the Glock burst, it's all about clockwork
Fuck around, and go to hell with a hot shirt
I don't go to Chinatown for my fireworks
I go to Achmed, test him for a bomb, first
Make sure he ain't lyin', tell on me, his eye'll squirt
Ghost Deini is real, me and Killa'll peel
Your cap back, and deliver the mil'
Niggas be pullin' out, but they don't use 'em
Big giant joints, they skate and lose 'em
The big yellow, this shit'll push your crew in
Look you dead in your face, like "What ya'll doing?"
Ain't killin' nothin', so stop pursuing
Fuckin' with my click, you'll just get ruined
Blowin' the weight, like Breezly Bruin
By the way, who the fuck, let ya'll fools in?




Ohh mad one, we see your trap
You can never escape your fate
Submit with honor to a duel with my son
I agree

I see you're using an old style
I wondered where you'd learned it from
You know very well, it's yours too
Heh, I had forgotten, will you show me?
And what have you come for?
You come here, since you're so interested - fight me


Yo, Picture bloodbaths and elevator shafts
Like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft
Check the print, it's where veterans spark the letterings
Slow moving MC's is waiting for the editing
The liquid soluble that made up the chemistry
A gaseous element, that burned down your ministry
Herbal vapors and biblical papers
Smoking Exodus, every square yard is plush
Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions facial expression
Leaves impressions, try to keep a shark nigga guessing
Give crazy shouts Son here's the outcome
Cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss
Shit is outdated, just like neckloads of Sterlings
Suede-fronts, bell-bottoms, and tri-colored Shearlings
I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular homicides
On July 4th in Bed-Stuy
Where money don't grown on trees and there's thieving MC's
Who cut-throat to rake leaves
They can't breathe, blood splash, rushing fast
Like running rivers, I be that whiskey in your liver


Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!


This is not a '85 affair made clear
When the Gods get on to perform storms blew up
Wu's up, causing the crowd to self-destruct
Killer Beez are stinging while I reveal
Science that's heavily guarded by the culprit
Bombing your barracks with aerodynamic
Swordplay, poison darts by the doorway
Minds that's laced with explosive doses
Damaging lyrical launcher
Lunge at the youthful offender then injure
Any contender, testing the murderous Master
Could lead to disaster, dynamite thoughts
Explode through your barrier, rips the retina
Who can withstand the astonishing punishing
Stings to the sternum, shocked in the Hip Hop livestock
Seeking for a serum to cure em


Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Ducking handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move like real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six-oh
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Building lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, Ki's in they vaginas
No peace, yo the police mad corrupt
You get bagged up, depending if you're passing the cut
Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's living heartless
Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest
Individual, critical thoughts, criminal minded
Blinded by illusion, finding it confusing




Huh, Master, he must be dreaming, heh
Well, if he is dreaming then he must be asleep
And if he's asleep, then I will wake him up!

At the height of their fame and glory, they turned on one another
Each struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy
In the passion and depth of their struggle
The very art that had raised them to such Olympian heights was lost
Their techniques vanished




Uh, uh, uh, uhhhhhhhhhh! uh uh
Ya'll motherfuckers
Ya'll motherfuckers
Ya'll motherfuckers, Ya'll motherfuckers, don't uh
Uh, uh, uh, uhhhhhhhhhh!
Ya'll motherfuckers, Ya'll motherfuckers, don't uh


Listen all Gangsta and Fellow MC's we now meet
The Threat is now a actual fact and that's the lease
The Lion Pore rippin' your Jaw dismantle face piece
You made out the Herd the scene
My Murder One Team, Something's best untold
Crime Related - I am who I am so fuck it if son stuck it
We all later paid the best - sipped the fine Grapes
My Rugged Lifestyle is survived - I don't Apologize
Hustlers devote I chose, there's no Compromisin'
And the Guns is drawn, shots fired
Son, all my killers is fam, non-hired
Ya'll faggot niggas wait for the sound for the things blast
Wait for the Train to past, Man face down
We straight from the Murder Capitol Town
It goes down - Daily on the regular
Dressed in Assassin attire, the bullet proof rep
Strap 'em wit the Bomb to his body, ain't no comin' back


Yea, yo these dudes out here ain't fightin' no more
You either dump or run, or go to the law
Me ? - I take it to the furthest son, it's Murder One
Maneuver ruegers, I call 'em Ferguson
You forced my hand to take you off the Earth wit Guns
Justify Homicide that burden is done
I drink that Red one straight out the forces, your boy lost it
I'm on the belt park where the Ratchet I toss quick
I'm Boss Bitch from that East New York
Where that cheap talk get you outlined in Chalk
Step out of line, we put your thoughts on the Sidewalk
You popped your top lock like we popped the Corks
You can catch me in the South on approach wit them Choppers
Or Bring out them Helicopters
Your boy gun dame is hella proper


Yea, soul Mass photo flash burned hot
Comin' for the kill, faggot niggas head gets chopped
And get rolled from blocks and gets slapped out spots
We in N.Y. keepin' live Brooklyn lick off shots
Make 'em duck talk, roll real slow don't stop
Til they get it and flock, See I aim for top
And Why ? don't ask why, just move wit my flow blow so-so
Watch how careers gets stopped
My Pop spend the seedin' I swam scream, strongest and broke through
Raised by to a General - Physical is holdin' weight
And leadin' the way like a Freight Train
But I jump fast, nigga you here ? You Sure ?
Ain't no horse play, don't play
Murder wit my Minds spray
Give y'all fools lessons of war, no more
From every Land on this Planet Earth
And waters all across, truly yours, the Flames, the Force


The Name's F.R.E.E. M.U.R.D.A
My nigga, Aye! The name is Free Murda
Killings is no limit even without C-Murder
We takin' Keith Burners, we don't give it back
It's like the Blocks slow it's hard to get rid of that
Kinda mad wishin' he should've had bigger Gat
Not this little shit could fit in my Fitted Cap
Matter of fact give 'em that, Make 'em do somethin'
But really though yo he ain't gon' do nuttin'
Bangin' me, I popped your bitch and now she shot up
The Name is Free and that's the opposite of locked up
I have you wacked up, they call the Cops up
You need a house worker had that blood moped up
Yea I'm like WHAT ? wit my Glock up
I'm a nut like the shit I get off Cocks up
I just popped up and already done wit you
Should've bring your Pops, the way I been sunnin' you
Came wit your thing, you can't fight you'se a lame nigga
Under the wing like lights on the Plane Nigga


Yo, fuck all the small talkin'
Get on your job or get the walkin'
Major League Batters in here, you steady balking'
The Mack maul cats like dogs or botched abortions
Make blood pour like bottles of bubbly popped the corks on
The war's on
Better believe I get my Stalk on
+Artist of The Year+ enjoy the fall - long
BONG! when it's all said and done I be long gone
Hong Kong gettin' my Cock in twat thru my Long Johns
Same song all around the World like 'Pac did it
Caught a lil half a hundred gram wit the Cop wit it
The Grass that I stashed in the Dash, hit the Block wit it
The Glock that I brought along for the ride, got knocked with it
Now I'm up top tradin' bars with my box niggas
Wit Two Strikes against me ain't no room for the Third
Even the Cops get it, got niggas watchin' they Misses
Doin' a middle harm Legs cocked in the air
Screamin' "Yeah" like Lil John
Should've pawn like Carm styles is on potty train
Shotty's bang, bodies slained, got niggas that could get it on




KP, Wu-Tang (see), Brooklyn Zu
Wit Killa on this track, we'll crush your crew
It's just like chess, think before you move
Don't make it your last move, we'll eat your food


I'm my own creation, and I mastered my tongue
They not ready for the butcher, son
Call me jetter home wrecker, but I cannot wreck ya home
You wreck your own home, and now your girl wanna bone
I guess she wanna rock and roll wit a stallion
Them BK niggas always wilding
What ya'll thought that New York was gone?
But I was in the country, banging those 808's, now facts


My style's like Gladys and the Pips
Patti LaBelle and David Ruffin from the Tempts
Patron and the kush got me bent, it make no sense
In my pocket is dough, in your, it's lint
I done seen more pussy than that white boy Larry Flynt
I bought my shit, you pay rent
Plus the bracelet on my arm, nigga, cost ten cent
And I borrowed a couple chains from Miss Ateen Sagrent




I'm cool as ice on the mic, make the world ignite
So nice on the dice, hit cee-lo twice
Kilo slice, weed blow illegal life
Squeeze chrome, needles, pipes, with peepholes
Egos fight, desert eagle light
Keep hoes at a febel price
Priest, the pharaoh of the ghetto
In all boroughs, life and thorough
Live from a rebel, fire from the devil


My life post wit twin ghost, delete chumps, deep ghost
Plus heat toast, stay street code and eat souls
Try to stay right, but I'm labeled I'm a Black Knight
I just might take life by end of the night
Take the gangsta Zu banger from the Dirt Dog Chamber
Slugs stopped then your Timb boots is getting a' scuffed
If you need it, I got it, you want it, come and get it, listen
My heat is an option, man, and you gon' be leaking




Yo, you see the universal flag, design a wicked sword swing
Thoughts connect, see banging flows keeping you wet
For all the ladies, this may apply, she fly
Like Bedstuy, see Killa talk, East New York
Where heads fly, stay high off the best shit
Thinking you can test it, the humbleness got you fucked up
To run up, and now you've become my enemy, no kin in me
Penalty for ways and acts, if you offend me
Ladies grab your man up in the party
Freak to the words I speak, I be the crew Chief
RZA Rah spinning the beat, summer heat
Got 'em bugging on the street, to teach the unciviled
I'm held responsible to build before I kill something
Voice of the people, I reap the terrible classic
None equal to the truth I build
With the microphone skill







Bear witness to the god, young thugs don't live long
Life is a game of chess (and you playin the pawn)
I be the king, listen to the knowledge I born
Walk a righteous path, you can never go wrong

Yo east New York, Schenectady, this kid live next to me
Manifest his destiny, to specialize in treachery
Subliminal, wanted to be nuttin, but a criminal
Wit braids, and doo-loo dropped out the eight grade
Tradin rocks, mad obsessed wit guns, was infected
Should of came amongst gods, could of been resurrected
He expected to live long, holdin the Glock
Never opened up his lessons, never took the salat
Robbed a liquor store, the old man knew him since four
Still slapped him wit the toast, and son emptied the cash drawer
Watchin news flicks, what the kid did, gettin famous
Found the owner in the back of the store, left brainless
The stainless was found, in the sewer three blocks down
The DE's flashed his picture around the Polo Grounds
Kicked his grandmother door down, wit a search warrant
Hand cuffed him in his boxers, tipped off by an informant
He was sentenced to thirty-two, Y Equality
Allah rules, he should of listened to his jewels

Chorus 2x

Young thugs don't live long
Life is a game of chess, and you playin a pawn
I be king, listen to the knowledge I born
Walk a righteous path, and you can never go wrong (word up)



This be the dance of the drunken, nigga found slunken
Over the steering wheel with one to his head, black
All those he drove his next destination of home
Suddenly sniped from civilization
Reality starts to set in, his last thoughts
Flashin back to where it all begun
A shorty who slung for a militant soldier
Who made his bones by holdin down the corner
Never turned snitch even though he was pinched by the Feds
He held his weight and did a bid
Of two to six, as he sat from his cell wit a vengence
He held in his heart like a icepick
Physically, he's cut the fuck up
Tryin to maintain but his head is fucked up
To learn, the word on the streets confirmed
Of the sickness, murderin a family member that turned informant
He signed this in a moment of silence
He broke it, this lead to bloodshed and violence



This chick Iris out in Queens had a cocaine Lexus
Dime sexes, she rock a leather G necklace
Building reckless, Queen kingpin deathwish
Hit women that'll fuck you and return them the essence
This evil widow, she pulled a fo'-fo' out the pillow
Wit a silencer, la cosa nostra cats, they admired her
They hide a force sting to hit the North Region king of teamster
Head C.E.O. of, a major ring but one thing
Lead to another, a leaf, blew her cover
She got side-swiped, tied up,  he buck fifty cut her
He shot her both knees then, dumper her in the gutter
It was gory, the top nigga tortured her for glory
But, he let her live so she could about this story

"Execute them" 


"Slang bang to wax, torture pack, pump it to max
Till your heart collapse, fully auto rap
Might lose your eye sight, blood type, a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype"


Yeah, y'all mothafuckers know, turn my shit up mothafucker
Wild the fuck out, word up fuck the radio
1998 word up, whippin illegal on y'all beagle-lookin mothafuckers
Yo, James spin off, slang dames wanna hit off
Czechoslovak' lock it down, lames get off
Jury match, range rack, fists of fury-act
Don po, six hundred glow, Wally mack poly like that
It's real ("Execute Them"), diabolical
Logical, strange chokehold, kill is possible
Flip a wig blindfold, rewind the scroll
Clip full-mo, flip on the glow, blow
Rock a arm-fold, tourist a bull report
Sit back, calmful, Timberland cold war
Hailin from my next down, rounds clip clowns
Buyin a loyal bitch gowns, go down, fuck them clowns
While we healin, minds, wheelin labs wit cathedral ceilings
Dryer, hitman for hire, alien flyer
"Slang bang to wax, slang bang to wax, slang slang bang to wax
Torture pack"
What what, step up, throw your sword up


Aiyyo witness the abduction, villa destruction
Blood rushin, from a universal standpoint
A lotta shorties bustin, but they gotta cum some
Before they can test my steel
I send a grandson to let em feel one, bodies not worth my gun
PC don, w-w-MastaKill.com, heavily armed
We roam, through the dark damp litter of the forest
Exploerer lives gold, bless em wit a c-note, throw em overboat
Slit his stomach so the body won't float
The vigilant, infinite patient I stand as commanding chief
Mad thorough, competition's intense from every inch of the borough

"Slang bang to wax, torture pack, pump it to the max
Till your heart collapse, fully auto rap" 
"Might lose your eyesight, bloodtype, a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype
(Execute them) I live to write the hype"


Murder verser, twenty beam rap fiend server
Rhymes nurture minds, bustin like twin burners
Certified live, five million eyes left wide
Inside we split the grand prize
Won it by a landslide, dance by the rest
They fit in contest but they pose no threat
Street corner warrior, cause crowd disorder
And glide like rollerblades 'cross your recorders
Soldier of fortune lost in the madness
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Po' bandit hold the belt single-handed
Most Demanded Assassin is what I'm branded
Far from your standard, universally
Planted jewels in the minds of fools left stranded
One man hit force, my shirt ripped off
Squeeze a full clip to kill the bullshit then I dip off

"Slang bang, slang bang to wax (Execute Them)
Torture pack, pump it to the max till your heart collapse
Fully auto rap, might lose your eyesight, bloodtype a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype"
"Execute them" 
"Slang bang to wax, torture pack pump it to max till your heart collapse"
"Sla-slang bang to wax (Execute them)
Torture pack, pump it to the max till your heart collapse (Execute them)
Fully auto rap, might lose your eyesight, bloodtype a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype

Seh back this argument, say dem must legalize ganja

Dem come wit cigarettes weh only give you lungs cancer, I heard

Some bwoy dem send fi needle and some snort the powder
Jamaica was brand as the land of ganja
A guy a look coke, send him go live a Colombia




Wu-Tang sound control America
One operator, one selector
Wu-Tang sound control America
One operator, one selector

Those unaware would not knowledge the square
I linger in the air like smoke, but I'm there
Hard to di-tect yourself
When you can't see clear through the rapid feed, them collie weed?
Original ganja plant, dem bear seed, the aroma
Got me callin my connect, I need a donor
To lace me with pounds from Arizona, the elusive
Bounty and the Masta exclusive
Many entertainer want the chance to bust
But it's only with the Gods I trust, do I puff
Burnin bush from in front ho
Lampin on the Bay of Montego
To a far wind, bringin wallabee Clarks to the starvin
There's no escapin the soundclash
Gun fire shot, I make it hot at Sunsplash










Yo, yeah check it... yo, yo yo yo
Yo, if you think you can  with the Wu Clan
You get ya nose gets swolled up like Toucan
If you think you can  with the Wu Clan
You get ya nose swollen up like Toucan
If you think you can  with the Wu Clan
You get ya nose swollen up like Toucan Sam
And we don't give a damn
Bullets soaked in oil so the Tec can't jam


Sippin on Caribbean rum, coconut juice
Smokin on that chocolate stick
Open up two bottles of that brass monkey on some drunkie 
You R&B fake rappers suck a monkey 
I'm from back in the days, with the Christmas for haze
On my back, striped out black
You like that?; seven braids in my head
My girl stays in the bed and she love to lay the eggs


Prepare for the mic onslaught swift with the sword
Slick Lord, holdin my weight homing abroad
The crowd roared for the peeps playing for the streets
I reeped and sewed, scriptures weeved and woved
Behold gold for the people equal
Fresh on the weekend
Wu-Tang, Biggie Smalls live at the Beacon
Backstage drinks on the house the show was bangin
Brothers Grey Goosin, Wu was Tanqueraying
Allah teaching schools in session, the Gods speakin
I'm just knowledging
Snake handshakes and fake hugs
Waiting for the hour to devour
And splatter ya heads to powder
I'm a slave to the rhythm
But never to a mental deafened power
The hour has come
We got y'all eleven to one son
You done off, too late to break north
Tactics are hazardous to the health, bomb stealth
Rifle stay M-16, know what I mean?
Know what I mean?


Yo just what we (stand for?) Loyalty
What we strive for? Righteousness
What we live and (die for?)
Strictly fam members only

A-yo, a-yo, great minds think alike
We used to drink all night
Think about things that's wrong and how to make it right
Ice cold bottles of brass, time flashes
A hundred blunts passes
Before the God asked us
What's the square miles of the planet?
Why is the axis slanted?
How much is covered by water?
How much is granite?
True-I-Master-Equality, God body be
Flowing like the chi energy inside your artery
Faithful as a polished rock against a tank
The force of my will still kill shooting blanks
Just from the sound alone ya heads blown
Still scoring in the red zone you best of head home
Or get thrown to the dead zone, son we need to ill
Interrupt the Grammy show and teach the kids


Yo Just', what we stand for?
What we strive for?

What we give for?

I grew up around block parties ready to rock
Behind the rope  with my rhyme on cock
Verse shot first  to pop
The bad weather blew the feathers off a hundred flocks
Seventy-percent goose, thirty duck
Get stuck if each link in your chain is truck
Can't come in this rhyme cypher with nine snipers
Charge off the juice from the pied pipers
Grew up around B-Boys, DJ's, MC's
Through rap, never thinking their ways of TV
It was strictly all about about magnificent rhyme clout
The R.E.C. Room, two dollars with the flyer, three without
Now it's wigs pushed back, name's removed
Off the plaque, too wild to reenact
With tax, that's the price to pay, my goal is to
Aim and spray; my night is the same as day

 (x2)
Yo Just', what we stand for?
What we strive for?
What we live for?
What we give for?
What we die for?

I'm sayin, you-could-you could just come over top of that shit...
Did I hear it?
Nigga and bang your head, PUNK!!

 *in background repeating*
SUCK A DICK!!! 6x
SUCK MY DICK!!!


And it don't, it don't, it don't, it don't, it don't, it don't
It don't, it don't, it don't, it don't stop!
It all starts wit the pad and pen, shall we begin
To burn bush in this rap session, once again
On the run be the Black Stallion
Now you fuckin wit Ticallion, hmmm
Iron Lung, boy me can done, army of one, blaze yo' bun
I'mma get you none, accept challenge AHH!
Run a mile wit a racist, they iced it, I aced it
Placed it, right up in their face till they faced it
Hard to the dome like a chrome microphone
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bad to the bone to the bone
Danger zone, that's my life and my song
Keep it movin, hop along little doggies!


Uh uh uh, FUCK YOU!!!
Drive The Mack Cadillac
Dark shade the window all sunny and black
Pitch antenna back of the car
Inside is a TV, even a bar
Bulletproof down, safe and sound
Chauffeur in the FRONT just to drive the Lexus all around
Give ya, give ya, give ya body a ride, nice and warm inside
Come to the Dirt Dog as the tummy rise
*Laughs* Enter


Yo yo my Wu-Tang cliff'll make your atom split
The power of my brain, you can't fathom it
Whoever go against the will of the grain will get slain
Don't EVER say thy God name in vain
My third eye electronic dragonfly spiral observe
Can record your words
And your lies and approach you
And have my Dogs come and Ghost you
When it comes to the bread son, the heat will toast you


Music makes me lose control
This is not just rock and roll
Hip hop digs right to the soul
Music makes me lose control
Wu-Tang, now we on a roll
On a rise, now here we go
Guaranteed to flip the show
RZA beats is outta control
Outta control, outta control, outta control
Outta control, now here we go


Yo who got that nigga gassed like he can't get skimasked
Abducted from his doorstep
Dufflebag his head for the price of nothin
He's a glutton
What I'm manifestin each day is a lesson
Ya'll faggots, came to the School of the 36 Chambers
Copied on papers of scholars that earn dollars
We trendsetters in Wu leathers, trendsetters in Wu leathers, whatever

Chorus  2x
Music makes me lose control
This is not just rock and roll
Hip hop digs right to the soul
Music makes me lose control
Wu-Tang, now we on a roll
On a rise, now here we go *Skip next line on the second time of chorus*
Music makes me lose control (2x)

Guaranteed to rip the show
RZA beats is outta control
Outta control, outta control, outta control
Now here we go




Turn the track up a little bit
We need to rock in here

I wanna make you happy


I'm not at all happy or elated, this category ain't my favorite
It's my story, I'mma state it, you could love it or hate it
I'm just a misfit blessed with good dick and intelligence
Hood nigga holding no grudges on petty shit
I started, why are we cold-hearted, so guarded
Scared to get hurt, trying not to love the hardest
That's garbage, remember when we loved each other
Bathtub scrubbed each other, chillin', champagne spillin'
Uh, feelin' like the shit gon' last forever
Time went so fast, we had a blast together
Laughs we had, friends we spent time with
Now I be seeing your friends out, then I'm reminded
How we all used to gather up for the holidays
Now your friends all nervous to speak, they act afraid
I was your bestie, how it get to this
As I reminisce, takin' off my MJs in my empty crib
Mary...


I wanna make you happy
But you just don't see it
I wanna be around, babe
But I'm so tired of competing
We say all the wrong things
Till we make each other cry
What are we doing?
Will it ever get better?
My heart, my soul
I gave, it's yours
I can't get back
All the things that I lost
Boy, I love you
But you're pushing me away


I gave you everything that I got
Watched my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside


Now I was hoping
We'd get through this together
You said you'd love me
Through all types of stormy weather
Wasn't it you who said
We'd be together for all time
But it keeps messing with my mind
My heart, my soul
I gave, it's yours
I can't get back
All the things that I lost
I need you here near me
But I can't make you stay




I never thought that I would have this feeling
Do you think for once that you can truly mean it
Wasting so much time disagreeing
See, I'm to the point where I don't know what I believe in




If you don't want this, I don't want this, I do my morning crunches
Play my jazz, pray to the east, and watch the sunset
Uh, but yet I was blowin' you up the other night
Could tell your girl was telling you what to write back
Tell me why it's like that


So make up your mind, boy decide
We can't go on like this, this ain't right (it ain't right)
Feeling really bad, feeling kinda low
Think it's time to go






Feelings. The emotional side of a man, woman or a child's character. A response or tendency to respond. A belief, which can be vague, illogical, but mostly, irrational


I never gave a fuck on how the next nigga felt
I rocked a heavyweight belt cause that's the way I felt
Still feel, so inspired to write a rhyme that's ultimately
No other emcee could get with me, is way I felt
Don't forget the first time you heard me rhyme the way
The first time you heard "Protect Ya Neck", the way you felt
Like no other hip hop record ever made you felt
Cards dealt, played my handle, when no matter how I felt


Every time we touch the mic, you know our lyrics is felt
Worldwide, live, polaroid shit, all my homies is
And we ride out to all of our music is
Yeah, we gets busy, teach the youth  because we know how it felt
Give em Knowledge of self expressing in a way that it's felt
So each and every person to recognize what they felt
Watch your mind state because the evil could be felt
You never know, how when I first came out, how my brothers felt
I've been going through it, plus a lot of deep pain was felt
We would last for a night, but a better tomorrow


I felt the angel of death breathe
When I felt the four fifths something told me squeeze
I felt like it was the end of a dynasty
Like I was fighting a clique of five Chinese thieves
Karate slippers with slip on's so I kept slippin'
The floor was too smooth felt like I couldn't catch a grip in
Felt like Dragonfly Jones, was Dragonfly Tone
So I kept spitting, woke up when I heard the phone


I never gave a what on how the next rapper felt
I take that rapper's belt myself, I feel how Cappa felt
I don't really need help, use a sharpie, don't need the felt
Marker, walk on water, I see how Jesus felt
No rhyme or reason, just bleeding, my every breathing's felt
This about a thesis that even paraplegics felt
These boys ain't needing, they barely breathing, believe it, seen it
Till you got cheated, you couldn't tell me how cheating felt
I'm not a failure, I couldn't tell ya how losing felt
Might not have nailed her, but I can tell ya how spooning felt
Remember when you first heard the rap and the way it felt
I burned the track with a murder rap and I know it's felt








This is hip hop melody, we goldy sprinkles of greatness
Jazz horn trumpets spoken word instrumental
Silk suit, Cuban link cables candlelit tables
Turntable spin 9th Wonder bling classic
This Wu-Tang style that Ive mastered, hand crafted
Utensil poison that pencil skull portraits
For you to picture mentally, blessed is the anointed
That punch to bring balance, serving universal justice
Reflect like the sky be blue
Peace to Zulu its Boom Bye Bye to your head
Respect to Buju, my ninja star ginsu
Catch me at the Bonnaroo
My mic assassin murda crew, throwing down invincible
Brother its the principle, respect due


You need to figure it out, baby lets figure it out
Figure it out baby, lets figure it out
Give it a whisper, give it a shout
I figure we can figure it out, what its about
Figure it out baby, lets figure it out
Figure it out baby, lets figure it out
Give it a whisper, give it a shout
I figure we can figure it out, what its about


I smelt the fire in Babylon when a kid got his travel on
9th let me tag along, miles from the vagabonds
Ventriloquism deep in the system
I never listen I was blind to the prism
Shine and glisten, a gold glitterin griffon
That make dreams come true but your souls are missin
I sold missions the rise
Who rose with him, they rose a cold switching stories a old Grisham
Nose twitching a penny pinchin
Not many listenin about foreseeing the vision
Chocolate crunch crown a calibration creation
Celebration of that lifetime occasion
Formulation of fornication on vacation
Safe saving my information that combination
This Obama nation my conservations a compilation
Momma waiting, hope she aint a patient
Resin is regular, our buds are better huh?
French inhale baby and taste the plethora
I rather you instead of her but
I make do with what I can, the casualties of man
Fight or flight I know you ran, drone scan
Called her from overland, they watching brother man
Fight or flight I know you ran, drone scan
Called her from overland, they watching to figure it out
Said they watching to figure it out
But never mind me, Imma figure it out
Never mind me Imma figure it out




Dumbed out for the free, duh
Release, dum, dum, relief
Minimalist dip the socially explicit
Implicit pure gentleman derivative raw
Breathing just to live all season fisherman
Reel them in a clip, pick, vision future tense
Edit, invent just to vent a bit
List the benefits, list the benefits
Whistlin a whim, more moms and a pop
More hot shots, more cop, more locks
More lax keys water hot more to rise
Order those  yea, go outside
More positive, acknowledge the pop more defensive
For the pisser, dignity lives here
Elegant residents say the skys lit
Then witness the thunder comfort where I lay the fitted






Yeah, man, the fire is the purification
I spit... energy.. no matter what happen yo, I gotta spit
Uh oh and I'mma do it for the team, I'mma spit...


Aiyo, I spit fire at you dudes until the die I retire
I'm doing this for my family, so that we can transpire
And reach limits that exceed doubt, yeah we can do this
But we gotta get up off this murder route
I'm on the block, momma love on the couch
And the pain is unbearable, the way streets keep steering you
In the wrong direction, I'mma need more thugs around you and more protection
And you still guessing, you don't know what life is about yet
I study and work hard for the set, I'm proud to be a doc
I'm not done, my mouth's like a tech, women wit me in the stretch
And the five burns from the way a man rep
Fire that'll burn at a man chest, energy that


I spit (fire)
You know I spit (fire)


I'm sweet flowing river, mathematics be the wisdom
Compound and we elements of sound, transmitted
Through the system of engineering
Technology allows me to transform
Words to sight, light is written
In five hundred seconds, since bitten and recited
A million black men united, from Shaolin
Medina heard the warrior call, we were everywhere
Already cocked and ready, one thought blew 'em off the planet
He can't stand it, head rocking, stadium shit
You know the champion, multiple armed subjects
Revolutionary techniques, please don't disrespect the projects
This is for the babies, and I don't want to have
Get ignorant and clap you
For nothing, we suppose to be brother and I other than self
It's the best part that sparks all things
Fire is in heavy rotation, all saying

 (x2)




The royal prince blessed me with the Gita for my physical
Won't give up, such value hosts countless of amounts of treasure
When I'm writing, so quenching to the thirst
So refreshingly enlightening and geniously exciting
Stimulating brain growth is all so relevant
For the youth development
So I drop musical notes for you to then quote
I gave the thought time to soak
While I smoked, meditated then I wrote
For years, months and days, before I even spoke
Test the climate of the people in search of what's missing
Then provide the lesson best for those that are listening


So emcees wonder how me and 9th Wonder
Make the ladies shake it in the club like thunder
My rhymes will beat fire out of something, no question
And 9th will make musical hits for you to listen


My winds blow EF5, there's nowhere to hide
I'll seek and destroy your toy
Rapper emcee who's thinking that he's live enough to survive
The mental of assault of rhyming, the timing
Travelous beats is blinding
I've been trying to slow it down in hopes that you could relate
But the slowest I can go is knowledge, there's no escape
So whenever I decide to escalate and add on
Atomically a storm is forming then born
You know it's my duty to warn them of this wicked
Before I have to ice pick it




See I could just let the beat take control
While I stand with this mic so tightly that I hold
The hundred grand in the rubberband won't fold
This is Sun ray showers of gold, my blackberry bowl
Some things better untold, not even soul
Y'all know the God black ain't cold
Yellow Bally's with the white soles, silks and gold
Y'all don't even know the way we used to flex and roll
My brother wonderful
Known to keep it stacking, spray the mac in his young day
Sean dude show me the 52, I gots to
Generate revenue, I must do capital








Yo, (Wu) one two (Tang) one two (Wu-Tang)
It's the Wu (Wu-Tang) creepin in the shadows (Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
Sir I, Excalibur  (Wu-Tang...)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
Yeah

My rap style swing like Willie Mays
My eyes Purple Haze, my solar razor burn through shades
Rhyme grenades raid the airwaves, catch this rap page
I glide like, hovercrafts on the Everglades
Born master, with the faster blade, track slasher
Manufacture poems to microphones, bones fracture
Limited edition composition spark friction
Non-fiction, the calm bomb, keep your arms distance
Zero tolerance, dominant intelligence
Wu original, true colors step from the melanin
The most high, most try, to get close by
And overthrow I, but choke, with they hopes up high
I circulate the tri-state and vibrate beyond the Richter
Fly sistas flock when they spot this live nigga
The crowd seducer black your third eye before I lose ya
Verbal high, leave styes in the eyes of Medusa
Top ten, poly like Cochran, and Sharpton
Narrow margin, of your odds to dodge the marksman
Murder rap, kill you soft like Roberta Flack
Words attack like a British Bulldog, observe the stacks

(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)


Now all pay tribute to this entity
A spark that surges through the undergrowth
Overwhelming the populace from the entry
The Wu-Tang Dynasty, has emerged
From this elite fleet I was appointed to strike the vital nerve
Mouths tend to utter and speak empty words
Observe the magnetic attraction as we breathe
Seeds of MC's at these fake ass industry niggas
Feed off, the chrome mic tend to squeeze off
And spray, an array of shots
That travel downwind, just respect my prolific pen
As I send, the minds of the weak
To rise and take power I blew tower-ing over the land
As we stand, expanding our cream
A dollar to every grain of sand
Let the mind use the physical as planned

(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)



Yo, yo, this is Beirut
Try to comprehend check out my new suit
Gods blend aim take fire pure destruction
Disappear from here, my year, drop the stupid LP's everywhere
Fallin out the sky tall sniper
Raps by Cappadonna hit the countryside
Poetry whirlpool, RZA and True collide
We produce article exception to the rule
We the black men that struck oil, the hardboiled
Cats that made that Watergate thing go spoiled
The heavy-handed, locked down stranded with Cyrus
Wu Pirates, sneak inside the club, low eyes
Low down dirty, twelve thirty, night time crawlers
Off-the-wallers, basketball gun brawlers
Smoked out throw both fists for nine-seven
Slang reverend, put the best work in

(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
Yo
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)




Yo, uh huh
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang


You think I'm kinda crazy, but I gotta few regrets
Livin like a king, with a pocket full of grits
We come from different worlds, don't you ever forget
I'm just a poor little white boy, showin my respect


Like Willie Mays
My eyes Purple Haze, my solar razor burn through shades
My grenades raid the airwaves, catch this rap page
I glide like, hovercrafts on the Everglades
Boom master, with the faster blade, track slasher
Manufacture poems to microphones, bones fracture
Limited edition composition spark friction
Non-fiction, the calm bomb keep your arm distant
Zero tolerance, dominant intelligence
Wu original, true colors step from the melanin
The most high, most try, to get close by
And overthrow I, but choke, with they hopes up high
I circulate the tri-state and vibrate beyond the Richter
Flies sense to flock when they spot this live nigga
The crowd seducer black your third eye before I lose ya
Verbal high I leave stars in the eyes of Medusa
Top ten, parley like Cochran, it's often
Narrow margin, of your odds to dodge the marksman
Murder rap, kill you soft like Roberta Flack
Words attack like a british bulldog, observe the stacks




Now all pay tribute to this entity
A spark that surges through the undergrowth
Overwhelmin the populace from the entry
The Wu-Tang Dynasty, has emerged
From this elite fleet
I was appointed to strike the vital nerve
Mouths tend to utter and speak empty words
Observe the magnetic attraction as we breathe
Seeds of MC's at these fake ass industry niggas
Feed off, the chrome mic tend to squeeze off and spray
An array of shots that travel downwind
Just respect pyrhiffic pen
As I send, the minds of the weak
To rise and take power I blew tower-ing over the land
As we stand, expanding our CREAM
A dollar to every grain of sand
Let the mind use the physical as planned




Beirut
Try to comprehend check out my new suit
Gods blend aim take fire pure destruction
Dissapear from here, my year, drop the stupid LP's everywhere
Fallin out the sky tall sniper
Raps by Cappadonna hit the countryside
Poetry whirlpool, RZA and True collide
We produce article exception to the rule
We the black men that struck oil, the hardboiled
Cats that made that Watergate thing go spoiled
The heavy-handed, locked down stranged with Cyrus
Wu Pirates, sneak inside the club, low eyes
Low down dirty, twelve thirty, night time crawlers
Off-the-wallers, basketball gun brawlers
Smoked out throw both fists for nine-seven
Slang reverand, put the best work in

"Oh, baby" "Oh, baby"

Wu, yo
"Oh, baby"




Is you ready?
Back by popular demand...
Murderous specialist tactics
Wu-Tang Clan, no rehearsal or practice
Niggas ain't ready for this...
Niggas ain't ready for this...
Niggas ain't ready for this...


Chrome dips beaming off July sun rays
Caesar fade, blending with the side burn shades
Cotton club status, clientele, SL, heavy jewel
Niggas jail, young niggas screw well
Swinging like Smokey on the slow beat
Johnny walker hold me, closely as I mosey on the low key
If you don't know by now, you'll never know me
You know me, I swing it to the young-ins and the OG's
Witnessed by notary public, certified rough shit
Does it feel good, how was it? Gritty like the subway tracks
My protocol permanent like graffiti on the project walls
On the AWOL, alias Jamal Duval
Roam through the universe, plans of owning it all
In the meantime, in between time, we shine
Dangerous minds travel on this uphill climb


If you want some, get some
This is it, son, this one
Make 'em feel the friction
Guaranteed hit, son, miss none
Flip one, you better bring your big gun


Some niggas I'd rather not spar minds with
They can't stimulate my thoughts or fuck with
Creative testosterone, mic-phone
Calms the menopausable hormone quakage
Trapped like estrogen, we making
All of the above, supremely I hold my shit, when I run
I hesitate to stomp the come
Bring water from the brain, nigga
They tried to send me back, but still I came
Terraform mind frame contains
Elements of iron which began steel, healing men life
Allah Just brought me forth to bust mine
This time I spare no one
Poison sword seed technique, breathe the Earth
Take the head of those and feed 'em to the universe
Blessed with volts of electric, life threatning segments, it's hectic


If you want some, get some
This is it, son, this one
Make 'em feel the friction
Guaranteed hit, son, miss none
Flip one, you better bring your big gun


Poetry in motion, east to west coasting
Overseas blowing with lines tightly woven
Still going full speed, pulling g's
Trying to eat 'til my mouth gets too full to feed
I excel, cast spells similar to Merlin
Mic surgeon, hang like Dr. J. Erving
Splurge inner city like uncensored version
Merging with the fast lane, stained with the urban
Word in the street, his work was dirt cheap
Synthetically weak, make the fans start beef
Any comeback attempts would only be in repeats
They soon fall off, be mentally lost beyond reach
My technique's heat leaves a permanent crease
Plant my 2 feet, shooting with the quick release
Never cease fire from a Street called Desire
The sire, disturbing the peace with c-ciphers


Who dare comes amongst and tries to peep it
The secret of the deadly art, then leak it
Snakes, leeches surround the righteous
I lick a diversion shot
Then slip with the swiftness to weave a raindrop
Leaving the eye confused understanding blurred
Cloudy electrical storms occur
From the Masta, classical head bang slang
The deaf tone rises like the blind and dumb
Licking shots at the microphone, Iron Lung
We the first to set off shit, last to run
Who want some, come and get some, motherfucker!


If you want some, get some
This is it, son, this one
Make 'em feel the friction
Guaranteed hit, son, miss none
Flip one, you better bring your big gun




If you got it, light it up (8X)


Ain't no shook in 'em, Pyrex pots is hot, fiends is cooking 'em
Little niggas hugging the block, cops is booking 'em
Women hugging they purse when they spot the crook in 'em
Back when little J got shot, pops was whooping 'em
Little noses dripping with snot, ock, now look at 'em
The ghetto got a hook in 'em now, drugs, stay pushing 'em
Used to throwing dirt in these blunts, now, it's kush in 'em
Used to tell these chicks to shut up, now, he's shooshing 'em
Get cash, get that ass or put a foot in 'em
Iron Flag, flag that cab, Bedford and Put-e-nam
There ain't no puss in 'em, dick, dildo, or gush in 'em
Niggas still got that juks in 'em

 + (Raekwon)
If he front then we stomp 'em out (Get 'em out ya way pa)
If he drunk and he run his mouth (Get 'em out ya way pa)
If he front then we stomp 'em out (Get 'em out ya way pa)
(Get 'em out ya way pa, move, move, move)


I'm seduced by the chrome, it's a ruthless poem
It took a little time to get his juices going
Producers know him as the kid with the Iron Palm
Righteous hammer examine the firearm
Approach or get fired on, permanent chest scar
Empire Strikes Back, check out the Death Star
Bless y'all, wet y'all, do the impossible
Where I'm from we use dum-dums in the arsenal
Highly sparkable, get stretched off the knuckle check
Known to scuffle, I take it to the upper deck
Universal conquest, kung fu buckle vets
In a dufflebag, max yo, a couple techs
Give 'em ear hustle, Wu brand we programmed
Next time we dance, it won't be a slow jam
I fear no man, son you get lynched up
Nigga bitch get Frankenstein stitched up




Yeah, voice skipping off percussion
Give it to 'em how they love it, slow flow, deadly, beloved
All praise the daunting calm yet
So alarming, without a word being spoken
A thought with no voice, just a nod and a look
The contract was took, straight cash, off the books
A major pawn took a Don, look, he's armed
With a few black rooks from the heart of the Crook
Shook ones look while they hung him on Hercules hooks
They found his body near a shallow brook, escaped on foot
Switched the look up, out of state, he got the hook up
The flipped cake, thought lighter than the feather
Yet heavier than weight when my mindstate starts to break
Take cover over RZA instrumental
I'm damn near invincible, it's simple




Tell me, what are they like?
They got holes in the top, five round holes
While I was watching, this stranger, hit them
But his fingers went right through the bone
So then, they've... mastered it
It's some style of kung fu, you know it?
The Skeleton Claw




Yeah, yo son you gotta take me to get them Clarks, man
Yo, check it out, yo
Yo, I got a new, yooo! Niggas don't even know son
Yo check the joint, boom
Yo I got a crazy idea how to do Clarks now
Check it out, boom, this is how you freak 'em, boom
You go get you go get the cream joints right? Boom
Now now, all you all you dye, is this shit right here, boom
And this, you know what I'm saying? Any color you want
But it'd be like, blue and cream, you know what I'm saying?
Shit like that, niggas don't even know
But son word is bond I'ma rock niggas this summer
On the real, know what I'm saying?
Yo son, I had crazy visions
Check it out check it out check it out, boom
Just imagine if you buy, woo! Check it out
Just imagine you bought navy blue, right
A navy blue, a navy blue pair right, boom
Of this, of this shit, know what I'm saying?
But dyed get this dyed cream on top
Just imagine that color like
But you got it dripping like it's marble cake like...


Stand on the block, Reebok, gun cocked
Avalanche rock get paid off mass murderous services
Chef break 'em, watch the alley cats bake 'em
Four-nine made 'em, drop grenades and take 'em
Quick fast we reflect like the sky be blue true
Wu-Tang saga continue
Rap Meyer Lansky crash your fantasy
Getting high fellas stand by, here's the plan, see
Sit back collecting Tecs and cheques and
Blowing slow in a Montero flexing
Beats break heavily word to INS bless me
Throw me like three bags of cess
For real from the Killah Hill locked and caged in
We're sworn representatives, we acting like made men
Strive for wives, nine lives and lies
Max, sell and enjoy the highs, what?


The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Baker baker, pull off a keystone kaper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and watch me scrape her


Proceed with caution as you enter the symphony
Degrees of punishment increase intensely
Syndrome was caused by the deadly drums
But the battle was won by swords being swung
Slicing with a vocal, from the international vocalist
Your style is too local to fuck with this
Offensive antagonist
No assistance, moving motionless
Mysterious swiftness
Thoughts roll down the shaft of the brain
Mental gives the signal to the physical
Whirlwind kicks and hits from every angle
Violent temperaments left continents dented
Poison vintage wine rhymes I invented
Drunk by the drunken puncheons that punctures the heart
Vital sparks from the arteries stopped


The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Baker baker, pull off a keystone kaper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and watch me scrape her


Straight up and down it's all good
Peace to them cheque cashing, chain snatching, gun flashing
Niggas in the hoods bubbling good
Analyze Starks, who be buying lion heads and Clarks
To all my house bitches, Starks'll be home soon
I'm on tour chill, catch me '96 in June
But until then my ten-man team be safe
Chill on the whips for seven months, we can all get laced
Take a boat cruise, sip daiquiris and max
Swimming pools, fly jewels, Wally shoes, blow stacks
Relax kids, black kids got a craving for Cris
Until we get back, unpack, leave the Mac with your Wis'
But whatever, I gotta hit other sides of the Earth
Spread Wu-ness, rule this, civilization's cursed
But luckily I'm born to be wild and then be out
Move crowds collect twenty thou and then be out
Heavy convoys my crew keep pretty boys paranoid
Built like a steroid pat down Dan Aykroyd
My seeds, grow with his seeds, marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family


The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Baker baker, pull off a keystone kaper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and watch me scrape her


My seeds, run with his seeds, marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family



It's been a long time since the father left in '69
It's been a long time since Wu Tang had the chance to shine
It's been a long time since we had diamonds, gold and drink Cristal wine
It's been a long time of walking around here dumb, deaf, and blind
It's been a long time since you had the Son of Man chant like golden wine
It's been a long time...




Digital Electronics!


So we gon' check the 25th caller
Caller? (Hello?)

My Glocko pop pop pop (x4)
You stomp the fuck off yo' block
My Glocko pop pop pop

Bob Digi-tech live in effect, you just didn't expect
One man to come along and bring a new song
And break your barrier down, you can't carry the sound
Buckwild juvenile from Shaolin Island, what? What?
Who wants to get violent? Remain silent

My Glocko pop pop pop
My Glocko pop pop pop
His Glocko pop pop pop
His Glocko pop pop pop
My son go pop pop pop
My gun go pop pop pop
His Glocko pop pop pop
One love, go pop pop pop

Yo.. who wanna play the hero? Your chances are slim
Less than zero, Shaolin laboratory friend
That's the shit though, came to satisfy but can't get no
Sound pasified from the get-go, Cuban neckties for you Kiko
Only carry mines for protection, the hoods like the Wild West I reckon
Hold up a second, lost my breathe and
Take it from the top Introducin'! (Mr. Method)
Runnin in your session
With nothin but my words as my weapon
And twenty-eight years of aggression
Do it for my people when I take it back
Like I'm repo-man, agent double-oh negro
Know who I am? No, I don't give a damn
Evil, flash a Crooked I like I'm Deebo
Gets down and dirty like your moms pots and pans
From a small town, drink ya down like Shazaam!
This is how ya Enter the Wu-Tang Clan (Yeah)
36 Chambers, you're pu-tang man (Word)
Brothers with a mic make a true slang fan(Yeah)
Brother with a gun make the loot change hands (Word)
That's how it is, you could ask RZ-A
Through rain, hail or snow I deliver


DJ, that music just turns me on


The marvelous bone crushin assassin appears to be
Blind in glasses
Daredevil bang head with shovel
Iron skin, Tony Starks, liquid metal
The rebel in the evenin, shadows sweapens, vanishin
The book of instruction, fuckin with the Wu-Tang Production
Is lord to all who come and see, my art too deadly to teach
Read my death touch, ascended grief between each point
Slendid, hand Swingin Sword recommended
Slice through the bone intended
Try to sketch the classes, reflection of perfection
Mic-phone swing like numb stick to scar
Mohammed Ali, mic MC, Shakwan walk the dead sea
Dead sea, Digi..


Yo, yo.. yo..
My mind keeps playin tricks, I'm caught up in The Matrix
Digital mode, your flows is all wasted
You smoke weed with seeds, I crush mines and lace it
Two tokes a pass, kid it's all basic
I know you lust, so relax and be patient
As soon as I spark the stem, ya all taste it
Number one on the charts, it's time to erase it
Replace it, you was wack from the start, face it


DJ, that music just turns me on


My Glocko pop pop pop
His love go pop pop pop
My Glocko pop pop pop (x5)
You stomp the fuck off yo' block
My Glocko pop pop pop
His Glocko pop pop..


DJ, that music just turns me on




Yeah, it's like salutation, greeting
Ladies and gents, good evening
I'm the speaker for the evening
Get up out your chair, throw your hands in the air
Have drinks on me, hit it slow, though
Each dose, well potent
Some particle, compound into one article
The headline read, shall I proceed?
Hell yeah, well let the turntable spin
Like the chrome on the G wag' Benz, let's begin


Aiyo, spit that shit, that make niggas wanna lick they Glock
When I grab the microphone, I can't stop
To drop that shit that make you get "ahh"
Down on your face, with your the gun to your --
Ladies in the club, they frontin' like --
My brothers in the club, we try'nna get "ahh"


Look, another smash hit, my niggas from the boulevard
East New York squad, in the yard gettin' ripped
'Least twenty five a clip, a hundred men stomp in ya face
The wolves barkin', careful, you might get trampled
Caught flashin', wrap him in the masking tape
Jimmy Basking, murder was the case when the crowd break fool
Iron Mic Duel held down by the poolside
Along came a spider, spun spools in a cypher
Screamin' on your mic, leads spray from the sawed off pipe
Stenographer type, the ghetto hype slang, flow roll
Like water off the brim when it rain
Iron Maiden, checkmating, no escaping, we takin' it


Aiyo, spit that shit, that make niggas wanna lick they Glock
When I grab the microphone, I can't stop
To drop that shit that make you get "ahh"
Down on your face, with your the gun to your --
Ladies in the club, they frontin' like --
My brothers in the club, we try'nna get "ahh"


So terrifyin', so electrifyin'
Ya'll niggas can't deny, it's so death defyin'
Also, unique, it's so much heat
On the turntable wax, when I speak on the beat
One-two, throw it up, like you came to give it up
Drop something in the collection cup, for the cause
Of the sixteen bars, fast cars and jewelry
Fine silk, Cantonese wine make the rhyme shine
Bright on the seven continent
Take it to the fullest extent
Go anywhere, and live


Aiyo, spit that shit, that make niggas wanna lick they Glock
When I grab the microphone, I can't stop
To drop that shit that make you get "ahh"
Down on your face, with your the gun to your --


Yeah, P. Diddy, I know you dancin'
Crowd still movin', ladies groovin'
When the God show and provin'


Shit went something like that, I can't remember how that go..
Knawhatimean?




When I was small
We had nothing at all
We used to eat Grits, for dinner
It was pain
Almost drive a man insane
What we could find for
To survive another day
But I said nah...


An old killa bee once hummed me a tune
Stay up at night, don't sleep on ya moon
Four seeds in the bed, eight seeds in the room
Afternoon cartoon, we would fight for the spoon
Old Earth in the kitchen, yell "it's time to eat"
Across the floor, you hear a dozen stampeding feet
One pound box of sugar, and a stick of margarine
A hot pot of Grits got my family from starvin'
Loose with the welfare cheese, thick wit' the gravy
Used to suck it, straight out the bottle as a baby
Steamy hot meal serve less than five minutes
Big silver pot, boilin' water, salt in it
House full of brothers and sisters, the pop's missin'
Pilgrim on the box on the stove in the kitchen


When I was small
We had nothing at all
We used to eat Grits, for dinner


Young shorties in my hood started hustlin'
Packin' bags at the neighbourhood associate
Growin' up, not as fortunate to have that fly shit
I'm too young, no jobs'd hire me legit
You walkin' down the street with ya gun in ya hand
Drinkin, thinkin' of a masterplan
Your Old Earth can't afford what ya friends got
So you roll up to the spot, with ya thing 'pon cock
And it seems worth the takin', stomach achin'
MorningStar veggie bacon go good with the grits
Now let's take it back for real
When we used to build at ghetto big wheels
With the shoppin' cart wheels, and wood to nail the seat on
Girls skippin' rope in the street
The Summer heat, left the jelly prints stuck to they feet
Skelly chief, flippin' baseball cards for keeps
Momma said it's gettin' late, and it's time to come eat


When I was small
We had nothing at all
We used to eat Grits, for dinner
It was pain
Almost drive a man insane
What we could find for
To survive another day
But I said nah...




Get it burn it, get it burn it
Get it burn it, get it burn it
Get it burn it, get it burn it
Get it burn it, get it burn it
(The gun'll go, the gun'll go..., the gun'll go...)


Aiyo, one thing for sure, keep you of all
Keep a nice crib, fly away, keep to the point
Keep niggas outta ya face, who snakes
Keep bitches in they place, keep the mac in a special place
Keep moving for papes, keep cool, keep doing what you doing
Keep it fly, keep me in the crates
Cuz I will erase shit, on the real, note, you'se a waste
It's right here for you, I will lace you
Rip you and brace you, put a nice W up on ya face
Word to mother, you could get chased
It's nothing to taste, blood on a thug if he gotta go
All I know is, we be giving grace
This is a place, from where we make tapes
We make 'em everywhere, still in all, we be making base
Y'all be making paste, these little niggas, they be making shapes
Our shit is art, yours is traced


This is the way that we rolling in the streets
You know when we roll we be packing that heat
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go...


This is, Poverty Island, man, these animals don't run
Slums where the ambulance don't come
Who got the best base? Fiends waiting to smoke some
Approach something, ask him where he getting that coke from
My dudes hug blocks like, samurai shogun
Cause no V and no ones, equaling no fun
Who want to treat they nose, huh? Body'll go numb
My woman need funds, plus her hair and her toes done
It is what it is though, you fuck with the kid flow
That make it hard to get dough, the harder the kid go
Harder the piff blow, harder when it snow
The pinky and the wrist glow, this here, what we live for
Get gwop, then get low, but first thought
We gotta get the work off, the gift and the curse, boss
Yeah, see I'm the shit yo, the dirt in the fit, no
Hustling from the get-go, the motto is get more


This is the way that we rolling in the streets
You know when we roll we be packing that heat
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go...


We was quiet flashy brothers, strapped all along
With the dirty .38 long, twelve hour shift gate
Took case, state to state, you think he won't hold his weight?
Put ya money on the plate and watch it get scrapped
We get ape up in that club, off that juice and Henn
And it's a no win situation fucking with them
You mean like Ewing at the front at the rim, finger roll a Dutch
Million dollar stages touched, techs, gauges bust
Trust no one, the lone shogun, rugged Timb boot stomper
Damaging lyrical mass destruction launcher
Nothing can calm the quakeage when I break, kid
Peace to my brothers up north, doing state bids


This is the way that we rolling in the streets
You know when we roll we be packing that heat
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go...


Whoa... this is the way we be rolling in the club
You know when we roll we be packing .32 snubs
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go


Get it burn it...

Life of a drug dealer
Killah hills 10304


Restaurant's on a stake-out so order the food to take out
Chaos outside of Sparks Steak House
Maintain the power, I feel the deal's gone sour
Nigga missed a wedding, late a fucking half hour
And his man who bought land from Tony Starks
While he was contracting bricklaying jobs in city parks
He's a loan shark, bitches raise a grand to a finger
In the garment district, got it sewn like Singers
Cause all that talk blasphemy this kid after me
For the heist, in a Burlington coat factory
Fuck it, he turned state's on my nigga Castro this co-pilot
Who used to drop rice sacks of blow
On this remote area we label Dead Man's Island
Two hundred miles South from Thailand
Right off the docks, I got luxurious custom made yachts
Burial plots, for my niggas hit with fatal shots
There's no need for us to spray up the scene
I use less men, more powerful shit for my team
Like my man Muhammad from Afghanistan, grew up in Iran
The nigga runs a neighborhood newsstand
A wild Middle Eastern, bomb specialist
Initiated, at eleven to be a terrorist
He set bombs in bottles of champagne
And when niggas popped the cork, niggas lost half they brains
Like this ex-worker, tried to smuggle a half a key
In his left leg, even underwent surgery
They say his pirate limp gave him away
As the feds rushed him, coming through U.S. Customs
Now look whose on the witness stand singing, a well known soprano
A smash hit from Sammy Gravano
Here's the plan minimum for the hit, two hundred grand
Half time at the game blasting niggas out the stands
The sharp-shooters hit the prosecutor, judges are sent
Photographs of they wives taking baths
Along with briefcase filled with one point five, that's the bribe
Take it or commit suicide
First rule, anyone who schemes on the gold in Syria
I want they small intestines ripped from they interior
I got a price for those jewels, ship 'em freight cargo
Don't forget to launder the cream through Wells Fargo
Reconstruct those processing plants for the call of Costa Rica
Four hundred barrels of ether
Two hundred pounds of reefer and fifty immigrants with fake Visas



The saga continues




I wiped the chrome off with the dust cloth before I bust off
What's the cost, life loss?
High price to pay for a small reward
Kill for that Bushwick and Horsely broad
I provided the jumper cables through the booster mini-packs
Based on the drama unfolding in the track
I don't hold back, I spare no one
Swords swing like shogun, now who want it?
You see the truth, then act upon it
Or feel the fire's full view
Ain't a MC that I hit can pull through
Y'all niggas are like kids, flashing plastic tools
Unaware of the multi-year dynastic rule
What?! Stupid!


Without a doubt, it's in the heart
Where the best darts were written
Sitting at the window of the Grand Old Earths
Youths thirst for knowledge, I teach but hold heat
Cause some savage niggas are lost beyond reach
Broken homes breed seeds of no guidance
Left to wander the streets and experiment with devilishment
Violent, felon offenders, supreme folders
One-twenty bomb holders let 'em off and explode
The battlefield haunting, the daunting
Wu-Tang dance, deadly emits six pence
Spiral, rifle barrel pointed, elastic noose
Plastic head wrap stifle, survival
Tribal, title - Secret Rival
Article subliminal message throwing
Bitch niggas hoeing on labels
Mic cables, capable of slowing down jets on deck
Fucking you straight through continuously
Justice, the war of the critical penital
Some long overdue, now served by the chiefs on cheat
Drama builds, it's the street prophecies fulfilled
Bitter chill currents to the invited
Bang for the phones, live niggas on their way home
Snatch poems from clones, we got it sewn




This is hood life
All my thugs rolling on dubs, living the good life
This is hood life
Everyday we live our lives, like it's the last time
This is hood life
Baby girl, if you don't know, this is the hood life
This is hood life


Son died wit the gun on his waist
Watch the barrel spin, the rude one beg no friends
Arm self, we bomb for the wealth
And chant, men engage in battle, set the stage
I'm prepared with today's Math, my mic be my rod and staff
All hail, this is Irief Jamel
Chief of the Chee Saw, gun you down southpaw
Still fuck my pussy raw, all praises due to Allah
Who wanna spar mind, on the 64
Truth be the bulletproof, be 'em wit the moo-moof
Truth within reach, born breach, I still teach
Civilization, to all the human families


Who's the Spanish kid, damage your shit, and he reppin'
To a nasty track, get the crowd moving, just like my weapon
Disrespecting who? Playboy, I thought you knew
Killarmy's a congregation of niggas that'll murder you
We talking prime time, no bells ringing, never heard of you
But if I died, and you fucking with fam, then I'm serving you
Personally, ain't no rehearsing your speech
I give you chills when I come through like a chalkboard screech
I never ask for nothing twice, I usually take it
You'se a tool that don't work right, and usually break it
I'm a keep it real nigga, ya'll usually fake it
Ya'll play around wit bitches, I strip 'em naked
I that hit you wit that Smith & Wess' I found in the lake, kid
Ya'll don't hear me? Then ya'll don't need to be near me
I'm not insane, I think it's just a life of pain
Raps, gats and drugs, just run through my veins
Not to mention, all that life adore
All the times I had to pull out and hit the floor
Exchange shots, empty the clip and serve one more
And if no one got hit, then we call it a draw
It's hood life, if you been there, I don't need to tell you
If you smell like swine or pussy, I don't need to smell you
Play your part, my thoughts is like state of the art
X-rays, don't play, slugs'll rip you apart




First things first, just let it be known, blow 'em from the dirt
Putting in work to get mine, yo fuck getting jerked
See I find the true shine lie within scent
Blinding these dispising envious niggas who analyzing my men
Ya'll weak cats? I seek and destroy like break beats
I take heat, from the fake in the street, and tap your feet
You know what I mean, don't touch me, rest of ya'll get amped up
Like Guess jeans, but courtesy like dry cleaners specialty
The recipe to me be 36 forms of energy
Born and swarm on, any enemy, remember me?
Last name's heard, and that's my word, you shot back but missed me
You bird, you blazing me is crazy absurd
Handle the cannon like I'm Julius Irv' and ball wit it
Violate and I'mma leave that ass just out the curb


Aiyo when lightning strikes my brain, electricity travel through my body
Twenty thugs with snubs, all up in the party
Knight Rider Ferrari, bitches, guns and drugs
Lay around in the dining room
Staten Island Platoon coming soon, money, greed and the law
My lyrics is hot in the summer June
Without Loud Records, my Army make more noise than kaboom
Magazine queen turn fiend for CREAM
She drown in the pool of kerosene
Her big mouth is what lead to fire, to the gasoline, she blew up
Like Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven
4th Disciple electronic musician
Bitch ass niggas play your position
Examine more bodies than a physician, physician...






Yo, it's Tone Starks the don, the face of a killer
The voice of the past and presence, I speak thrillers
Rock the purple robe, crush them with 24 karat gold
The chain is chunky like the neck of a monkey
Glass slipper, my wallows is made from lion skin
King of the jungle, ain't shit about me humble
Rock a black panther hoodie, nigga, made from panther skin
I'm black on the outside and black within
The hood superhero, the motherfucking Don Dada
The Don Wilson, nigga, I do what I gotta
I'm a boss, them DeLucas trying to front on my skin tone
I left the fam to start a fam of my own
A black Italiano, big pinky rings from Sicily
I move like the don of the fam, its officially
War time Starky, on some black avengers
Shadowboxing with killers that move like ninjas


I declare war, war on the De Lucas
Bulletproof jet planes, nigga, you can't shoot us
Can't stop my reign or terrorize the power
Tony Starks, new king of this crown, y'all better cower


I'm prepared to go to war for the battle of supremacy
There's nothing now to remedy this decision
The only thing left is the loyalty of the family
Cause once we establish the power they gone turn sour
And use everything in their power to shut us down
We've come to far to turn around Tone
Got a new connect, Don Stone
Flew his private jet from Rome to talk business
He heard about your crime saga poems looking to invest millions
It's up to you Tone, this move can make us both rich
The crew is armed, cocked, and ready to rock steady
It's non-stop hustling, flow of their own casino, RZA Tarantino
It's Wu Gambino for life, you know how we go
And to the last breath blow, mi amigo




Born into a world with violence, death and destruction surrounding him at every turn. Tony Starks took control of his own destiny and aspired to become one of the foremost leaders of the criminal underworld. Regardless of his will, and the ability to run the streets with invincibility, there were still those who chose to stand in his way




He's just one man, don't make him sound like a god damn army


Yo, it's Tone Starks, the don, the face of a killer

This rap game ain't what it seem
Artists get cream turn fiend, selling people a dream


Aiyo, you rappers don't amuse me with your crystals or Uzis
Industry groupies, living after movies
They Scarfaced my race, some support hate
Life's a court date, some die to escape so hold your weight
Y'all niggas brag too much, fuck with us, we bag you up
And use the same clique that you thought would back you up
Its '98 eliminate bait and open gates
Enough of chains and whips, let make brains eclipse
We all claim we rich, hold thugs in crypts
Forgot about the seeds growing up seven to six
Fuck a Benz with tints, I got the Razah prints
Y'all rappers love idols, there it is I'm convinced
Burn my contract, mental combat
And stomp your battle rap with a Vietnam track
Red and white Sadaam rap sippinh Cognac
I bet you didn't know that the real Jews are black
I tell the truth cat where your mind juices at
The world or the heavens?, God or the reverend?
Your girl or your weapon? Christ or Armageddon


This rap game ain't what it seem
Artists get cream turn fiend, selling people a dream


Here in this life, big cities a dream
On the low is the scheme, a fiend that clock green
Without jocking somebody's sting, about the plot
You pull the ox, who pull the stash out the lock, yo what up Oc
About ready to pull the rabbit out the top
Platinum gold oops upside your knot, now nigga stop
Now nigga please, you ain't really ready to roll them sleeves
With your three degrees forty below, enough of recipes
Tight jeans, hype and don't know what nothing means
Acting like you Billie Jean selling how to be a fiend
When your loves about black marketing a nigga for his cream
And the Big Apple it ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled shes a queen from out of town wagging her swing
All around with she glasses and women asses
Is what made men jack asses
Everything including your company jacking
You niggas asses for your ransom
And next thing you know they got a nigga dancing
Chancing him out of his advancements
And how y'all gonna pay back these back taxes?
This ain't healthy for your assets
It's like your face done been bashed in your career ain't happening
After the monkey wrenches and forks done been stabbed in


Intriguing to the ear but bitter to the heart
I begin to take part in the art of dart throwing
Starring the Wu-Tang swordsmen
Raindrops fall the block remains hot
Steam rises from the streets which forms the clouds that I move through
Renew my stainless sword style
Allah has spoken, the golden code of silence has been broken
Mic terrorist  brew wickedness improves
As I ascend and expand extend I seen men
Fall from grace tryna trace the origin
But there is no beginning or end to the lifeline
Sunz of Man forever shine through the mic line


This rap game ain't what it seem
Artists get cream turn fiend, selling people a dream


I sad case of a rap star, permanent scar caught in the rapture
Of the bar code, he was more sold like Old Gold
Paraseuco, industry whore, bitches adore
Truly yours, feeling me more enemies fall
Ill and hardcore, ready for tour, shaking breaking jaws
Making new laws open the doors healing my sores
Blessing the poor, the art of war we less a boar
Verse one we guard a star and the starting artist
Another target on your market style is garbage
You get bombarded whole clique slapped retarded
Pussy harded MCs bleed slugs to the body
Its physical domination, lyrical laceration, brutal termination
When you fuck wit the federation
Collaborating with my nation, discussing allegations conversating about the downfall of Satan
Ghetto frustration keeps my head piece aching
Constant motivation keeps my world in rotation


This rap game ain't what it seem
Artists get cream turn fiend, selling people a dream


Cars? Women? Huh livin lovely? Phat houses?
What you think its about?
Not gettin paid? Havin fame? Havin everybody lovin you runnin up to you?
What you think its about?
Think its about teaching? Think its about givin up jewelz?
Givin something for the children to look up to?
What you think its about?

This rap game...y'all gotta figure that out...This rap game




Yeah, yeah
A-yo, a-yo
The I-N-T-E-double-L


Its like Im trapped inside a cage
I cant explain this type of rage
Its not a moment or a phase
But possibly the end of days
Watch as I stand up on the stage
Not as an artist but a slave
Deep inside my subconscious
My music keeping me sane
They say its levels to the shit, I say its levels to your brain
You cant acquire the higher, youll always remain the same
Regardless of all the money and bitches yanking your chain
What good is a private plane to a man who cant walk the plains
Hip-hop is now gen-pop, populated with lames
Attacking you with these frequencies meant to destroy your brain
Im fitting to go supernova expose em to super-flames
Soon as I pick these locks on these psychological chains
The answer is in the question the question comes from the pain
And the pain is just electrical signals sent to my brain
But the brain is just a box where information remains
As I try to remain a soldier, the voice in my head explains


Im still shadowboxing lungs and oxygen
This an icebreaker, no bubblegum was popping
Another hot concoction trick, ya might need amoxicillin
The kids too sick, you're gonna need shots to kill em
My method is ill, Doc admit him
When I see you, ICU can get em
Your boy give em bars until the judge acquit him
The court cant convict him or find the gloves to fit him
Thats OJ, I mean OK, I mean, Im not kidding, no play
Jealous ones still envy, thats Jose
Peace to Cartagena, I flow hey
But I dont speak Spanish, yo no se
Im a seasoned veteran, obey
Obtain a freestyle, its cold pay
The old me, resort to my old ways
My old man was stuck in his old days
Still he wanna blaze like John but rapping aint in his forte


Look how we did it to ya
Yall just dont get it do you?
Special deliver to ya
This is how we give it to you
I'mma get it to ya (x4)
What rapper spit it truer?
But they dont live it, do ya?
My shooter cock the Ruger
This is how we get it to you
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)
I'mma get it to ya(RAW)
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)


It was only the elite who could walk these streets
With jewels and not get stuck, niggas didnt give a fuck
Real Gs know Im talking about
Taking what you making, stripping what you wearing
Caring about nothing
Gun barrel in your face, cold steel on your cheek
This is how we meet and greet, enemy across the street
Leaning on his Rover jeeps, smiling, showing all our teeth
Seeking son in my hood, it aint all sweet
And you havent earned the respect
Of those who come, creep and take money
So you just food that niggas come eat
And they dont get no chain back
You might see em rocking that
Fuck you looking at? Problem needs solving
You see that big 357 thing revolvingrevolving


Yeah, you niggas aint street, my money talks word of mouth
I figured you out the life I live, youre not about
Price on your head, Im taking cash advances
Ill take my chances, then deal with the circumstances
Livin off the land like a land shark
Im on the lamb like the gyro with the white sauce
Idle times a devil playground, make moves
Watch me kill your whole vibes, crush groove
Hands high, say hello to my little friend
Point the finger at the bad guy, its me again
Who are they to criticize me? I do it like a G
Im a nigga from the motherfucking streets
Throw me in the fire, watch me bubble
I was built for the struggle, my knees never buckle


Look how we did it to ya
Yall just dont get it do you?
Special deliver to ya
This is how we give it to you
I'mma get it to ya (x4)
What rapper spit it truer?
But they dont live it, do ya?
My shooter cock the Ruger
This is how we get it to you
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)




"The story you're about to see, occured along the main
Trading route, on the border between the North and South..
At a small outpost called Red Clay Village."


What the fuck y'all niggas thought, huh? What you thinkin bitch?
Are you stupid son, must be stupid kid
What the fuck is wrong? It's the Wu bitch
Ain't got a clue bitch, tie ya shoe bitch
Get the fuck back, 'fore we break a f... listen
Tryin to tell y'all niggas, give you a fair warnin
Just a chance to live, so you can see ya kids
Yo son nah, before I split ya wig
I'd rather feed you this, but you ain't wanna eat it
So now you got to FEEL IT!!

Beat changes
Yo what the, yo
Let me fuck it one more time then y'all can fuck
Y'know how we do it in the hood
Yo.. yeah.. turn the mic up, yeah, yo
Y'all niggas better rock y'all hoodies
Take money snatch jewelry, in the hood
You find the best woman lookin good
Diamond she need polishin
In my hood, all the gunshot legal
At the same time we gotta stop killin our people
Keep it in the hood, niggas walk with they gun
Keep it in the hood that's where we come from
I rep Brooklyn, home of the gangsta
I know a few murderer, drug dealer
In the hood, we speak mathematics and build
What's the total weight of the brain, Allah real
Slang jacks and hold gats, in the hood; 80 proof
Get my dick sucked on the roof of the projects
Dice game in the park, blunt sessions after dark
Movin with the Wesson
Welcome to the God we build and drop a lesson
Pussyhole testin, in the hood
Got the word from the hoodrat, shorty on the wood


Murder, bad boy ya block off ah
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah
Murder, nine millimeter me say
Murder, no time fi talk, one fi
Murder, men an' dem ah talk 'bout di
Murder, Masta Killa come calm wit nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying, me say murder


Ay yo, we boys in the hood, big bad wolves in the woods
It ain't all good, pass the goods
Deep in the project halls waitin to shine
Walk with a nine and talk with gang signs
In the hood, niggas put twenty on Hoopties
Four heads, one forty ounce and a loosie
And keep dough on the flip, a ho on the strip
And roll dick throw on the flip
Weed clouds thick enough to block the sun
Cops come, but thugs never drop the gun, understood?
Far from ya Hollywood
From day one, I vowed I would keep it in the hood
From project chicks with hips and slim waists
From five dollar plates apartment six-eighths
O.G, I spit G to the young ones
I keep it in the hood that's where I come from


Murder, bad boy ya block off ah
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah
Murder, nine millimeter me say
Murder, no time fi talk, one fi
Murder, men an' dem ah talk 'bout di
Murder, Masta Killa come calm wit nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying, me say murder


This is the place where thugs is born
In the hood - Blink to long ya life is gone
In the hood - Convicts still live with they mom
And they whole family tree is tattooed on they arm
In the hood - Crack fiends'll furnish a 'Llac
In the hood - African's be drivin cabs
In the hood - In the streets the ghetto is hot
And the illest gangsters, on the block with cops
In the hood - The ones you love'll fill you with slugs
In the hood - Babies born addicted to drugs
In the hood - We make life or death decisions
And the school system is like a minimal prison
So you can't knock the hustle or the life that I'm livin
In the hood - it ain't all good, repent or you sinnin

 (x2)
Murder, bad boy ya block off ah
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah
Murder, nine millimeter me say
Murder, no time fi talk, one fi
Murder, men an' dem ah talk 'bout di
Murder, Masta Killa come calm wit nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying, me say murder




Shout out to Morocco, what's going down?
This your boy, MEF, Mr. that is
Capital M, capital E, capital F
I'm here to speak upon things, one of your hometown favorites
My boy Cilvaringz, doing big things upon this
We gon' make it pop like this
Ya'll wanna see what time it izzy
Man, this is in the name of Allah
RZA, Shabazz the Disciple, Masta Killa
Killah Priest, your boy John-John Blazini
Let's do it


Listen, the wise elder spoke, write as I quote
Then open the seal, and reveal these things
That will come to pass, if you can last through the storm
Man will be tested in all forms
Then flesh will be beaten until submission
Forgiveness has been given to spare your life
Still your eyes glaze when you greet my wife
Sinful thinking, it's strong wine and drinking
Lead to the destruction of such men as Samson
The grace period given for those who will repent
Those other than righteous, Masta Killa will send
And time is at hand, as I walk the land
From the U.K., back to the streets of B.K
Given sight beyond sight, to write the unseen
No amount of treasure can measure the gift given
To speak the unspoken, it's the chosen


I need one cup of Dracula's blood, two virgins
Dressed in all black, to start my sermon
One heart of a merchant, one teeth of a priest
The head of a monk, mixed in a bowl, with the 9/11 souls
I see him in the sign as the reverend was told
I read the scroll, but I'm still blindfold
Wait, I need more ingredients, so I look for the seeds of disobedience
Chop off the foot of Bush, throw him in the pot, let him cook
To every word I jot in this book, I pray the FBI's overlook
The recipe for America's destiny
Tech will squeeze, after dragging, I stab him in the abdomen
Free the Palestinians, free the Africans
Free humanity from the insanity, our planet bleeds
Mission cycles of symbols and idols
Our skin put Bibles, Qu' Ran, been through temples to old mosque
Stepping through the Garden of Eden where the revengeful angels throw rods
Oh God, save us from the outrageous Pagans, I spray guns, til the barrel's empty
I'm like Moses to Pharaoh's envy, turn of the century
Burning in misery, think...


In the, name of Allah, who we give thanks and praises
They turn us from the wages, watch over your saviors
He gave us life, made us upright and raised us
He wrote the book, we live according to your pages


When the holy father spit, you see the bottomless pit
Demons rise out, Shabazz close the door, this God's house




Titanium fangs, skull nearly mammal
At the holy city of Mecca, on the back of a talking camel
Grey Flannel Cologne, crazy ammo get blown
Wherever I sit son, that is my throne
I'm the reason why time started, I be the kind hearted
Trying to bust me, you aiming at a blind target
Designed with a sublime for the vintage
I control the whole, don't deal with no percentage
Even with a 3.5 mil deposit
Your life is still illusive like a CGI composite
Where your mind and your body discombobulate
Need to regenerate, let your mental seed ovulate
For nine months, in the womb of my wisdom
You may find a program to descramble the system
And cause a glitch, whether bright day or black pitch
We strive to build homes, and stack chips
From the ice of Alaska, to the heat of Calabasas
We over through the master, he build our own castle
Remove the impostor, take it up an octave
As my vibe continues to energize your chakras
Out of Allah mercy, I speak these verses
To help bring the truth from beneath the surface
To help get the proof, from beneath the churches
Defeat Shaitan, and complete the circle


I move with a strike of elegance
Like Saladin on a horse, backed by seraphim
Where flowers open and my past and unruled is downhill
But see, I'm quick to the back
The fate for the house of Mecca, the stone of Abraham
My word alone will enslave a man
Deeply to the sword of Islam, though he resides with his mom
In the Pagan land, the shit's calm
Praying to the cross of Christ, what is right
But the Qu' Ran claims Christ never lost his life
To the crucified punishment of Roman justice
And that's why the Bible cannot be trusted






What up Prince Rakeem, Masta Killa, Cilvaringz
John Blaze, S.T.D., in the name of Allah
(Yo, yo, one-two, one-two, turn my mic up a little bit
Turn the headphones up just a little bit
Turn the frequency up a little, yo...)




New York, New York, New York, New York, he he, yeah...
New York, New York, New York, New York, yo!


My devastating hot East New York mentality
Keep me on point for my million dollar salary
Heavy weight lyrics never lost one calorie
Fat stacks, drug dealing styles the black AC
Nickel-plated macs, We pack the chrome tecs, yes
From one single idea, everything appeared here
Understanding makes my truth crystal clear
A yo, snap out of Candy Land kids, the old rumor is
Blacks become immune to shit, we never did like
Cross color clothes crossing over, getting crossed out
Criss crossing we bossing all cross breeds
I'm a knowledge seed, I want action, that's what I need
Never no doubt in my mind, it's the rhyme
Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, defeat, it's not meant for me
Victorious with no opponent that blast through components
Jamel Irief raising hell with the flavor
Smoking on the mic like smoking Joe Frazier




Murder one of y'all niggas..
Get to hurtin one of y'all niggas..
Bitches, snatch the shirt off one of y'all niggas
Kick dirt


Color Glocks splitters just listen there's UFO visitors
Fly paintings remainin, reclinin pro-comissioner
One boot off he Rudolph, know he hyped flew off
Hibernatin, dead in the makin, ear-rake him, gear-rake him
Technician murderer, Wu hit the universe
Our words is crush, fingers icy slush, ringers wants Mercedes bust
Tip bottles, Movado, sailin in some Wu goggles you follow
Mail and jail letters, sendin niggas lottos
What made you murder my flow, what made you rival my clothes
What made you  fuck it, yo son these niggas gotta owe
I think a lot of flows, I flip exotic hoes
We paintin pictures if it's was drizzies, seen a lot of those
Gettin fly with Ghost, Power just buy the boats
RZA your vision is exquisite, daddy hide your scrolls
Platonic chronic shows, tonic prose
Off the meter Panasonic know, son line me a ho


Devestatin shockwaves strikin the nation
Newsflash, warn the people, assassination
The hour of detonation, pure untampered or mixed in any form
In any form mixed untampered it's pure
Dissect each line of the rhyme
Find my ingredients and nutrients
Teach patience and obediance before movement
Killer bee student enrollment
I'm out your control and expose if it's synthetic
Quote these plush degrees as I inject, there's many at risk
Slang therapist Shallah Rae
Bless the people, with magnificent wordplay




Aiyyo you know the half, some get respect, most we show the path
They quoted tracks while we spoke math, blowin fast
Expose the craft, first picks chosen in the draft
I don't flash, hoes love me cause I hold a stash
Known to blast, paramedics couldn't close the gash
Floatin past in a 'Nail with the oak dash
Show the cash, watch it blow in half, it's no fair
They goin mad, check their tape recorders and their notepads
Crabs wanna play me close and grab
Can't believe you on the canvas, I'm just throwin jabs
Where the powers you supposed to have, hand in your soldier rag
You posin bad, show your ass son, you won't last
With heavy weights that elevate the whole mass
Compose a smash, rollin grass at Ghost lab






Yo... yo... yo... yo, yo


Time to knock 'em out, cut 'em with the glass hand
Time to shut 'em down, I'm coming out the badland
Oscar the Grouch, kid, jumping out the trashcan
The last man that violated, got chopped with the sword
Send him a one way express ticket to see the Lord
You think we falling off, the beef's internal
All that bullshit we going through, it don't concern you
I'll thermonuclear burn you, you'se a human sacrifice
Cuz I be smashing mics with the Passion of Christ
Stay fully loaded, equipped with action devices
Kid, stashing these stripes, join the force
Honey, take ya flick, lift and point to the boss, soon
As you blink, your coins is tossed
It only takes four bars to get my point accross
And I'm cold as winter frost, on top of the mountains
Elijah, was the prophet, along came Malcolm
And I'm scalping niggas, taking devil's heads
Money generated, niggas taking heavy bread


I was born in a barrel of razor blades
Right next door to haze, I used to be afraid
Of the devil, as a boy, but now as a grown man
I realized, he is just a toy
A grafted image, of the magnificent splendid
Dominant, prominent, Islamic
I was here before the dinosaurs, shine and defining law
Measure every inch of the Earth, combining more
Elements and chemicals, fire, space, and minerals
Kept devils on the run, like Monk-Monk the General
Appear in a gang attire, slept in a ring of fire
I, got a bigger beat than Billy Squier
Dirty Dick Dastard' dart, straight out the dungeon
Transform on niggas like the rail whip from London
Paul Bunyan ax tracks, get peeled, caps back
Hard to get out, nigga, head like naps
Parental advisory, no M.C. is wisin' me
Me and the mic, like, ebony and ivory
We go together, like, cheese and cheddar, like
Jeans and sweater, like, Mo' and better, like
Who could take a sun ray, twist it to a rainbow
Darts sit upon your head like the Kangol
V is for Victory, I mastered your trickery
Tryna clock like dickory, get smoked like hickory
So please stop the bickery, you can't get rid of me
Wu Killa Bee, from now to infinity


Look at this bitch ass, snitch ass, about to get a kicked ass
Get mad, get smashed, and get another zip bag of 'dro
For these ho niggas, slow niggas, told niggas
Fucking with the coal miner's daughter, she a gold digger
Killa, I'm back iller, been realer, chinchilla
Coat, ex-crack dealer, cap peeler, dope
Uncut coke, cut throat, niggas had enough dough
What up, though? My nigga, I don't trust no bitches
That's real shit, feel this, vanilla Dutch and steel lick
Forensics is still tryna figure how I killed it
Wu-Tang, my crew bang, let our nuts hang
Like that piece on a new chain, mami, pop the poontang
Your party, find me where the stars be, or probably
Walk into the corner store on Targhee
Smokin' Bob Marley's, I'm hardly, a nigga to be fucked with
And you tryna 'catch up, but you barely cut the mustard, aight then


Just another spine chiller, U-G, RZA
M-A-S-T, A-K-Illa, M-E-T-H, O-D gorilla, straight from the Killa
Brownsvillah, do or die Bed-Stuy
Murderer, East terrorist, we clap gun thunderist
Land of the Iron Gods, swords can't live
Medina stay warrior, how can I escape the block
From being boxed off, lost in the shuffle of life
Living right cost, legendary crime boss
Fresh kicks drip in the street, beautiful unique
Freestyle, be so wild, fresh out the Penal
Track it on the Pro Tools, foul, smooth as blue nile
Wave spin, water blend, dart flow, sun glow
Kool Moe Dee roll, gang up on a power show
Snoop never love a ho, bang it on in your vehicle slow
You don't know how the God be flipping the style
And keep it so, Witty Unpredictable
Truth or Natural, the Gods is actual
It's a fact, I was destined, to grab the mic and bless them




I know why you're here...
You wanna test out hard with my kung fu
(No, I've come here -- and I need your help
Your steel darts, you still have them?)
What for? (because they have guns
That kill up to a hundred yards, very powerful)
My darts could beat a pistol?
(You wanna help or not?)
{Duh-deh-duhn... live and direct
We got the connect, we gonna ride
Deh-duh-duh-deh-duhn... deh.. deh..}

"It's what it is!"


No question, sensational dart, no dollar superbs
Spoken word slang, throw them with perfection
Slick when he talk, simplistics, stand exquisite
Tiger palm smack ground, one man down
Got a few that'll kill right now
Bring his crown back with Kunta, one-two
The truth and the square, dare any man to stare
Down the eye of the barrel, like a needle to the camel
You will never enter, nuff ammo
Shaolin Finger Jab, stab the man running
Deadly sold delivery, stunning poetry
For the masses, solid liquid gasses
Gather to a bomb explosion, Sony eruption
Frontin' on Pelon, Lei Long'll get you swung on
Long barrel spinning rims on something foreign
Semi-auto flow spit forty five in the left grip
Right hold the mic tight, strike
With the force of Mike, when I'm speaking


Straight from the Hall of Justice, Hummers
Dirty bones, black 'Didas, black reefer in jars
We fly militant, brilliant thinkers, tanks
Yo, pull it together while we guzzle these drinks
We armed veterans, holding up swords
Driving Alfo Romeos, breaking down Sicily yayo
We seen the drama, drawing these heaters on cheaters
Shooting at bitches, hopping up domes for weight
We wild style gorillas, fly apes caught in Botanical Gardens
Trying to get back to the States
The harder they come, the harder we scrape
We coming back in jet lears, flying through the Tri-Boro today
What's really good, live niggas go up beside niggas
Mad bullets sit in your hood
We titanium vets, with jet fuel, vision the biz
We orchestrated like no other, word to mother


Say, why'd you have to ask me, there are many experts
(I know you, you're my brother
Also your darts are pretty formidable)
Heh, I must admit, it's fast as the speed of light


Yo, I rock a black mask, homemade bottle of Goose
Toney moonshine his miracle herbs and African roots
Blow suits, slap A&R's, tapered your jaw
Had you chopping off your body parts like this was Saw
Cut raw, got the Fishscale flooding the streets
And Masta Killa's blowing girders outta crystal sheets
Slay beats, just the Verra' boss, Wu-Tang Holocaust
Fuck around, leave you with a mouth full of murder sauce
Broken, hanging off the cross with one nail in
Chuck meat, ya chicken bones is looking real frail and
Heavy, my seventy seven got suicide doors, my wrist
Chirped up with pretty rocks, with no flaws
Guns stay barking like pitbull spiting, it's frightening
How Ironman, ricochet lightning
Bob and weave, duck and squeeze
Why ya'll can't pop holes in the kids, holla!

"It's what it is!"
"It's what it is!"




Shit is traveling, hehe, yeah
Uh, and you don't dare stop
Come alive party people give me what you got
Uh, yeah, hidden gun spot


It don't take long to write a song, when the beat is strong
Check the bicep, flex the tricep
When I hold a microphone, you can't take it
When I start to spit the dart, you can't escape it
Trace it, and guide for you to write ya next shit
Supposed to be bitten, and sent three times a day
Fully automatic word spray, hold 'em at bay
Red dragon slay, turn M.C.'s to souffle
M.K. outta B.K., flight outta J.F.K., on his way to the U.K
Heard the fans wanna see me and GZA perform
When Math throw the "Liquid Sword" on, we gettin' on


Check it, darts fly, through the air, hit the M.C
I lay 'em all out, til my clip is empty
No one can take the hate, from the Clan
We execute, carry out the plan
My pen glides across the paper, like skates on ice
Makin' rappers think twice
You don't want to enter this deadly chamber
Even on the same track, you still a stranger
Just the thought, raise the hair on your skin
And once you step in, you feel the forceful winds
Prefuse 73, lace the track, and the DJ
Put many cuts on your back
Even in the foreign land, we still reign supreme
Whether solo, or the entire team
All over the globe, we represent the hip hop
Hoes and forces are bound to get dropped, what?


Wu World Wide, GZA, Masta Killa
Saga continues...



*instrumental intro*


Intruder alert, sound the cymbol
This be the war of the Shaolin Temple
It's time to restack my gun
We the ones that'll come through and smack sparks out your art
With the exception of a few that respected it for what it was
Sick venomous sydrome, studied many styles
But this tactic I've adapted and made it my own
Feelin rightness at it at home, splittin your head with the chrome
He's one who sees he's a threat
He couldn't have made it through, all the bad seeds and quarentines
We hit him with explosive gases, so he couldn't teach the masses
But still, who came in the name of Wu-Tang to nourish the brain?

*instrumental until 1:42*

Repeat verse




Yeah, yeah... we gon' get high to this
(The world's crazy, son yeah.. you know)
We gon' get high to this (just something about her)
My girl's a killa, my girl's a killa
(You know, her bag was always heavy, everytime I been around it)
We gon' get high to this (and diners, and restaurants, I don't know)
Yeah... yo...


Aiyo, I couldn't get enough from the way she smell
Was it Baby Phat, J.Lo, or straight Chanel
Her face belongs in a Luther video, Never Too Much
The way she smile, her face look pretty, though
Hands is soft, feet, no calluses
Her father owned six Palestine palaces
Laying out in New York, plush villas in Vegas
Greatest designer wear, son, she sport the latest
So I, pause the smooth talk, made her a drink
Blew her a kiss, as I sat down, she smiled and winked
Stood up, grabbed my hand, what up, slid ya boy to the bedroom
Popped the suitcase, I'm in the lead room
This check was loaded, equipped, with fifths
Porcelain handles with horse back kicks, whispered
"You know what, Ghost, I do hits" But niggas get fooled
By the sexyness, I'm a real gritty bitch


Killa Lipstick, my femme fatale, with the biscuits
A hit chick, now I'm number one on her hitlist
She killing the game, cuz she the business
Type of chick that love you to death, then leave no witness
Killa, I call you Killa cuz you slay me
Killa, you murda, mami? Ooh, you such a fucking lady
Killa, drive me half crazy, let's go half on this baby
Killa Lipstick, k-k-killa


Yeah, this white chick from L.A., she smelled like Downy
Had her best friend named Jade, from Rockland County
Double cokeheads who love cartoons, type chicks who eat pussy
Listen to Prince and play with they wombs
Flight attendant out of Delta Airline, get money girls
Travelled the world, only one did jail time
Jade, her father's a judge, same nigga in the O.J. case
When he tried on the glove, but uh, in this scenario, four A.M
The bars closed, now we at it again
Drunk nigga, come out I'm popping mad shit, he's past lit
Nancy Drew, drew out her purse, the blue steel ratchet
Didn't even say shit, she blasted, barrel smoking
Shot the Henny out his hand for laughing
These are my bitches, Nancy and Jade
Natural born killas be letting they guns blaze... god damn!




Look she tired of the same old basic, let's face it
This is how she wants to be laced, I'm raping it
Anywhere, I'm taking it, she loving how the gangsta flex
This is thug sex, Iking it, nasty talk
As she liking it, spanking it, she biting the sheets
She's a freak, my view from the embassy suites
Is off the beach shore, Dirty would've love you, mami
'You like it raw?' A tear drop, fucking you slow
I see your knees knock, your love is so sweet
If I switch beats, and hit you with angles, you might breathe
You know the Godbody make healthy wise seeds
You, plus a glass of weed, is all he need
You could travel so far, look, maybe book a flight to Mars
To escaping at, one forty two?
They take Jet Blue for two, into Long Beach
Rain lifted whipping the port, from when I touch
Look something nice up in the stash, hit a Dutch








Aint no Bugattis round here, just a old box
Swishas on deck twistin up the whole box
Today was wonderful I came up on a few rack
The definition of a G bring the truth back
Yea the grooves back Im on the panoramic life
Nightime vision in my shades and its damn near night
Yea, I put a hunned on this smoke bag
Smell like an onion in this smoke bag
Get yourself toe-tagged, niggas so fast
Run up with your ass, I run up in your whole ass
No disrespect to your ass but mami want it so bad
I stick em like post-its Re texas hold em


Im the king, said Im the king
Yea Im the king of rock, there aint none flyer
And I wont stop rockin, I wont retire
Im the king, said Im the king


It go, Kash, if you see what Im smokin now
Take two and pass nigga, blow it out
I know it smell loud, but really it sweet
My spot on cloud nine yall know I put up my feet
And Imma have a drink, Im on the ground black
My  I love her for that
Imma call up my connect and get up on a few jars
Last time I seen her had to run a nigga two large
On that Jamaican fruit, he call it fruityard
And now its martian green, it gets you Bruno Mars
Yo, listen I be on that Khalifa shit
Aint nothing silly though, yea said




Come up for air shorty, take it easy mama
You aint gotta impress me, slide it cooler than Gretzky
To the rules when its messy, keep it true would you let me
Disrespect you like how most rappers rap about in they songs
If we do get along can I Vietnam bomb
Surprise you with witty charm
Flip another response to her messages
Lessons is prerogative, prolly twist a piffery

Disappear, no forgettin me Im slippery
Musician, claim Im in need of a muse
Just an excuse for her in my swimmin pool
Rap perks kinda cool, never stop rhymin fool
Do it every day, all the time and my dude it go


Microphone blue and the flow is so fluid
Just cool you, just some catchin up to it
Hot liquid drips the lyrics hit the pavement
Like daisy cutters through the basement
Taste the aftermath of my iron palm blast
My five daily 
Who could last the session with my Cherokee chief
See my wallaby Indian mocks
Watch me shadowbox, 52 locks blocks tomahawk
Ox chops technique street sweep
Yellow tape, white sheeps gun smoke somethin dead
My chess game blow you out my frame
So by any means I be the royal lion kings
Son Ill be the royal lion king

 3x




But I love the way... that you carry yourself...
Even love the way... you wear your hair...
Ain't that loving you' (Ain't that loving you')
Baby, ain't that loving you' (Ain't that loving you')
Baby, for more reasons than one...


Roses are red, violets are blue
On one knee sucking your hips, up in your poo, boo
Got a flu, cuz I'm loving your candy lips
Tight as a glove, when we lock, understand me, miss
We made love in our socks, Hawaii was our last trip
Water splash the ass, right between the rocks
Dreamy fox, your hard nipples, yo, I kissed them
As if a spring fountain came running through like sprinkler systems
Your eyes twinkle, I'm your victim
Your hot jacuzzi love, unplugged, Stephanie
Her pops, don't like black people, that's why she left me
Especially, fucked me, test me, then stressed me


You got some tig ol' bitties, you every bit of pretty
You come from Cakillac, or just to see me in the city
You got the oh my goodness, you got the oh my goodness
You bootylicious, ma, your doggystyle is oh my goodness
I see your nipples peaking, I got Victoria off the hook
No she telling every local single secret
You sweating and you moaning, I'm wetting and I'm grown in
I'm biting my lip, ma, your head game got me zoning
Wanted to thug you at first, now I love you the worst
Every man in his right mind, wanna fuck you on Earth
Your fragrance got me floating, your patience got me open
The type of dame to give you brain, playing video games and smoking
Forever and a day, my love song, my babe
The love jones'll stay, when you love zones a way
Forever and a day, love song, my babe
Love jones'll stay, love zones the way


I let love slip away...
Now all that I can say...
Is hear the toast to a better day...


This is King Toast Queen, we touch glasses
Sipping the finest imports, burn murs and Love Supreme


Peace to my forefathers, stories of King Solomon
Autobiography, momma, this is my reference
Been up north twice, avoided the pins on the last setting
Ghetto cambaret, watered down charteney
Not only brought up, aknowledge yourself
Momma said you my boy, so avoid the negative gassing
Ain't no future in flashing, everyday struggle, who asking'
I live amongst snitches, who love when po-nine kept
Who was in the projects blasting, old timers
Whispering how I'm a dead man standing, a star of the track heads
Pushing stolen video parts, God body, but still love criminal parts
The girls ate pork, all winter then had asses in the summer
Millionaire dollar run-up, rolling on the roads that Allah paved
Word around the hood, Mary J. Blige would say
Solomon Childs, ghetto celebrity, top grade, nuh...


I let love slip away...
Now all that I can say...




Suga, come here, ayo man, tell ya man
He better bring that fucking money here tomorrow, man
You, walk up in the joint with me, man
It's all real, yo, what up son?
Yo, hold the bottle, it's your night, nigga!
It's your night!
Yeah, mad bottles! Playboy! We out of here, man
(Step inside, kiss the ring --- so salute, and toast to the best who done it)



When I step inside, kiss the ring, Wu Familia
La Cosa Nostra, it's our thing
So salute, and toast to the best who done it
Murder rap shit, I spit, for the vets who love it


By the time you read this letter
Your head gon' fly off your shoulder for lying
And I'mma be in bed like holders
Blood from a horse on your spread, you tried to play me now
I'm coughing up, dough on your head, you just a baby
See me in the flick in Zurich, I had to maybe with me
All these niggas stay in the 90's, getting rich
Rick Ruler robe on with rings, walking to the throne
Fronting like I know I'm the king, I live alone though
Buying up, China's Beemers, taking it to Simon's in Medina
Only just to blind you and leave ya
These young boys is crafted with aim, I bought 'em all
Fly ranches, cuz they all stand beside me with flames
Regardless, yo, to making the classic
You gon' witness some of the tactics
Some died, live in the action
A live general when he walk, if he died, then we slide
Ninety thou' in the coffin, and take the child


When I step inside, kiss the ring, Wu Familia
La Cosa Nostra, it's our thing
So salute, and toast to the best who done it
Murder rap shit, I spit, for the vets who love it


Black Jesus, check my walk, check my talk
Legend in the flesh and I rep New York
Crowned king, been down to bang, I'm House Gang
Knockout specialist, in and out the ring
Got dinner tables long as boats with old kitchens
And Wu-Tang logos splashed on all the dishes
You know how I speaks the truth, how I teach the youth
I'm an animal, I beast the booth
Been grinding, banging out for food to eat
Your boy still eating good, check my new physique
Since the world is mine, I'mma write my name on the clouds
So that ol' yee faithful, can praise it and bow


Now he's an old Mafia don, from back when
He managed to survive the game, ducking fame
It's how he maintained, the State of Grace, kept his lab laced
Ladies of a fine taste, kept his place guarded
While the young charted, found acquitted, all charges
And his heart loss and, marksmen take the contract
From the contact, waiting for the right event, it all made sense
He left no prints on the weapon, and he was blasting
Came home from prison stashing, still stacking
His whip still matching his kit, steel flashing
Hands quick, nice with his shit, three holy foods drops jewels
From a street corner level, young brother, I'mma rebel
Here to instruct private soldiers to buck arms
Ya'll rap cats had your last win, toast the kings
It's Wu-Tang, it's our thing, kiss the ring


When I step inside, kiss the ring, Wu Familia
La Cosa Nostra, it's our thing
So salute, and toast to the best who done it
Murder rap shit, I spit, for the vets who love it



"Koto... Chotan..."


Yo, yo, Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah, I'm not reneggin'
I don't fuck with dead pigeons or the pigskin
You fuckin' fake 85% snake
Derelict ass bitch, your class in dead weight
Ain't no fire escape from hell, every devil ain't pale
I blast like H.G. Wells: "War of the Worlds"
Allah is Lord of all, you sure to fall
Collapse like the Berlin Wall, while I'm just hurlin' ya'll
Lightnin' bolts ---- by writin' quotes
Strikin' jolts that frightenin' to adults
A to Zig-Zag you get smacked, all in a shitbag
Flushed like the spermbag, because your germ had
You on some ol' fake thug shit
Drunk from the drink, gassed up by the drug shit
Wrong analysis: kidney shot cause dialysis
While the Gods rebuildin' Jerusalem, golden palaces
Babes in Wonderland wonderin' where the fuck Alice is
While you're jerkin' your dick catchin' mad callouses
Slave labor steel drivin' like John Henry
Layin' down underground tracks for nine pennies


Huh, get you amped off the anthem
Yeah, I get you amped off the uh...
Yeah, look, another smash hit
My niggas from the Boulevard
East New York Squad in the yard gettin' ripped, at least 25 a clip
A 100 men stompin' your face, the wolves barkin'
Careful, you might get trampled, caught flashin'
Wrap him in the maskin' tape, Jimmy Baskin
Murder was the case when the crowd break fool
Iron Mic Duel, held down by the poolside
Along came a spider spun spools in the cipher
Swing with all your might, lead spray from the sawed-off pipe
Stenographer type, the ghetto hype slang
Flow like water off the brim in the rain
No escapin', Iron Maiden, check matin'
Grandmaster Flash spinnin, P.F. cuttin'
The sticky Afgooey, rolled in the fronto leaf
Jamel Irief smash teef in beef


Some people lyrics ain't hot
My delivery is ill on the mic and I rock
So hot, this stage should be a stainless steel pot
Leavin' burnin' pains Neosporin couldn't stop
On cats who couldn't rock
Would shook cause I drop 'em
Fear is a probelm in this game if you got 'em
My mic I carry the heat for rappers playin' possum
'Fraid that I'm a see 'em, spit a rhyme, lyrically drop 'em
Just to say I got 'em, but it's realer than that
I'm about more that what you see and what I speak in my rap
So be conscious of that
Grand told you, "Watch the quiet ones, you didn't get it?"
You think that you could rip a chick who spit her lyrics
Pretty rhymes so tight my lyrics did it
Got you open and it worked it and you won't admit it
Hopin' that we both forget it
These ain't no one night stand lyrics, I'm never really finished
Got you duckin', tryin' to pivot, beware
Next time, come wit' it

"Koto... Chotan..."




Lot of people, you know what I'm saying
That be getting misinformed, thinking everything is everything
You could just get yourself a little deal, whatever
You know what I'm saying
You gonna get on, you gonna get rich
And all these labels be trying to lure us in like spiders
Into the web, you know what I'm saying
So sometimes people gotta come out and speak up
And let people understand
That you know you gotta read the label
You gotta read the label
If you don't read the Label you might get poisoned


Bomb these niggas God!


Tommy ain't my motherfuckin' boy
When you fake moves on a nigga you employ
We'll all emerge off your set, now you know God damn
I show living large niggas how to flip a def jam
And rough up the motherfuckin' house cause I smother
You cold chillin' motherfuckers, I still warn a brother
I'm ruthless my clan don't have to act wild
That shit is jive, an old sleeping bag profile
The soft comedian rap shit ain't the rough witty
On the reel to reel it wasn't from a tough city
Niggas be game, thinking that they lyrical surgeons
They know they microphone's a virgin
And if you ain't boned a mic you couldn't hurt a bee
That's like going to Venus driving a mercury
The capitol of this rugged slang is Wu-Tang
Witty unpredictable talent and natural game
I death row an mc with mic cables
The epic is that I rush associated labels
From east west to atco, I bring it to a next plateau
But I keep it phat though, yo
I'm hitting batters up with the wild pitch style
I even show an Uptown MC a style
Who thought he saw me on 4th & Broadway
But I was out on the island, bombing MC's all day
My priority is that I'm first priority
I bone the secret out a bitch in a sorority
So look out for A&M, the Abbot and the Master
Breaking down your pendulum
As I fiend MC's out with a blow that'll numb the a-
-ppendix, I'm holding more more weight than Colombia
Index Interscope, we RCA, clan
That's coming with a plan to free a
Slave of a mental death MC don't panic
Throw that A&R nigga off the boat in the Atlantic
Now who's the bad boy character, not from Arista
But firing weapons released on Geffen
So duck as I struck with the soul of Motown
My central broadcasting systems is low down
And dirty, like that bastard
It's getting drastic


Read the label and say it loud
Another Wu banger
Thirty-six chambers, through your area
(Yeah, the RZA, phat tracks on a disc)
RZA razor RZA razor sharp
(Another Wu-Tang production kid, coming at ya)




After this drink.. we-we-we..
Now become sworn enemies!
Huh-huh, after this drink, we
Now become sworn enemies!
Sworn enemies!
(Uh, yeah, come on, come on, come on, pick your gun up
Come on, come on, come on, salute nigga
Real cats)


After this drink, we, we now become sworn enemies!
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)
After this drink..
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, yea
Yeah, real warriors style)


Hear the crowd start holla
Stepped on stage in the Wallabee Clark
Mic check sound correct, so vivid
Like I'm stepping out the speaker, streets taught
Never leave an enemy behind, when he goes
He might strike again another time
I came home from the warhead, fucked up
From the things that I saw
Women that were kinning me, slept with the enemy
General strayed, the ghost seemed tempting
They were deceive, what they were promised, was never received
I cock aim, squeeze the gun at M.C.'s
Not for a dollar, not for the fame
Not for you to holler, or shout the god name
A risen one from the slums, speaks with authority
The dart well flourish, the wise pursuit wisdom
The fools soon parish..


After this drink, we, we now become sworn enemies!
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah, yeah, get your gun ready)
After this drink, we, we now become sworn enemies!
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah, what, come on, what, yeah, uh-huh)


Ahh... this is born everlasting
The style came blastin', through your component
Makin' ya'll want it, but ya'll can't clone it
Deliver to the booth, the truth is so raw
Hard to the core, wild as a boar
A lion like roar, forty day tour
Through the Singapore, boat with the ore
Struck a nerve when he heard the words so clear
His heart was hardened, by the lies and deceit
Then came a beat as rare as leap year
Sparked something inside that made him wanna ride
And go cop the tape, he searched for, for years
Like an old beat break, Hypnotic on ice
Chillin', he drankin', Armored Truck tankin'
Crowd charmer, it's the Iron Mic bomber
Piercing through your armor, bad news that you can't diffuse
Short fuse, you know we can't lose


After this drink, we, we now become sworn enemies!
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)
After this drink, we, we now become sworn enemies!
(Come on, come on, come on -- come on, come on, come on)


Ahh, see the God light so bright, I hoodied up the sun to glow
Few lines from the mindstate, create fat tapes to go
From the present day, let's motivate
The universe borns itself, I just insist in the action
Testin' in the land of lust, stood firm, in the God I trust
Met hate at the gate, grieve, no need
Jealously took his head, and then fled
Bangin' in your walkman, live from New York, in
One instance, look, clone from existence
Ride like a crocodile on the death row
The Iron Mic poem..


Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, uh
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, yeah, ahh, yea..


Making your way in the world today, takes everything you've got
Taking a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot
Wouldn't you like to get away, get away, get away..




Let's go... yeah... yeah, yeah, yeah...


Kaboom, I came through the door
Never seen a girl like you before
Your eyes, your lips, your hair, your smile
Oooh baby, I like your style
Heh, I just need a clue, to what a brother like me must do
The touch, the kiss, to hold, me with
Just get that thing started
Oh no doubt, I'm gon' love you right (no, no, no, no, no)
Woman so just cozy now
There when you need me to hold you tight
Never left stressed out, or in doubt (oh, no, no, no, no)
Well welcome to the world of the Real McCoy
Three times a man, never was a boy


Baby, we're here doing nothing
We should be into something
I'm looking at you, you're looking at me
It's all good, girl, burn some weed
No need, you stand around fronting
Let's go get into something
I'm crushing on you, you're crushing on me
Let's go kick and roll some trees


It's so cool, I moved close to you
I begin to smell your sweet perfume
I smiled, said hi, y'all don't, reply
I like it when they act too fly
Heh, all insecurities, could never discourage me
The smooth, finesse, I will, impress
Can't help, but to, confess
I came here just to love you right (no, no, no, no, no)
Woman so just cozy now
There when you need me to hold you tight
Never left stressed out, or in doubt (oh, no, no, no, no)
Well welcome to the world of the Real McCoy
Three times a man, never was a boy




Aiyo, peace beautiful, here's just a few lines
To let you know I was thinking, look I had a few drinks and
Then I lit a bone, thinking bout your skin tone
Pretty fat face, with your high cheek bone
I love to hear you moan, you know our phone conversation is grown
You sayin' "daddy come home", I'm all alone
Here staring at your picture, kinda hating, I miss ya
I soon come kiss ya pain and make it better
You dressed with my sweater, for the scent of your man
While I'm out hustlin', black gloves on my hand
My mind pan, pictures you in front of the fan
I know it's been a little while since you felt my embrace
You miss daddy taste, you pace back and forth
In your Vicky thong lace, the anticipation is great
You can't erase, the thought of my arrival
Feel the tingle, it's the sensation


I be rubbing that, holding that, loving that
Girl, I know you like it like that
I'm looking at you, you're looking at me
It's all good, girl, burn some weed
I be loving that, holding that, squeezing that
Girl, what you gon' do?
I'm looking at you, you're looking at me
It's all good, girl, burn some weed





 + (Raekwon)
(Yeah, yeah) Aiyo, how much more for a fifth of Vodka? (Peace beloved)
(Six bottles of Henny, six bottles of Henn) Word, word, let me get that
Herb, yeah, yeah.. (bring that bucket here)
Yeah (get some ice, man, two more bottles of Cru', man, word up)


I've gone through life pretending
That time will change the ending


Peace to the God (peace God) pour out a little liquor
Shame On A Nigga, I heard the reaper done came to get ya
So I done copped a fifth of, Vodka, and in your honor
I've grown this fetish for loose ladies and baby mommas
Some say it's bad karma, what you do, man, it come back on ya
Music got us up off them crack corners
Now I'mma swallow this whole bottle for Ol' Dirty
Damn, it hurts me, I hate it when brothers go early




Word to my son, he gon' remember you, rubbing on a statue
In his lab, that resemble you, and what it meant to Wu
Us forming like a family, you just blew
You was the chess piece on the board, that made us look true
Watching your pen swish, you love frying kingfish
You the pearl in the ocean, I'm up on the land, pissed
Now you moving more prestigious, me, hitting this reefer
I know it's real, guess I slept with the Black Jesus




I became weak when I heard, that his body expired
It was hard for me to believe my brother retired
Suddenly the clock stopped and the room started spinning
How can he walk off the field during the first inning?
I cried like a baby on the way to his place of death
Hate not being there, the minutes before he left
Now I'm in the booth, ten feet from where he lay dead
I think about him on this song and what he might've said




When I first heard the word, I needed air to clear my head
I know you didn't say what I thought you said, my brother's dead
You crazy, another Dirty prank to get the family cranked
Ya'll niggas shouldn't play like that, I know how you feel
Lord, but it's real, and I still can't believe
And my heart still grieves the loss, there's no pretending
Ason Unique, loved wine and fine women
We singing on tour, "ooh baby, we like it raw"




Can't pretend...
Some day it gotta come to an end
But I'mma keep you right here dog, real close to my heart
Yeah...


I popped a bottle on your born day, God
Tried hard not to cry, I still can't hide the scar
And I still ask, why to God, analyzing your form
As I stood there beside your mom
And I share the blame, cuz you was calling for help, kid
Should've, would've, could've, had the time, I was selfish
I carry on your struggle, each day it really hurts me
I really miss you Russell, hope you forgive me Dirty




Yo, these walls I wanna crash, and put my fists through
Shout out to Dirty, let the whole world miss you
Reach out and kiss you in your coffin, my heart races
I dropped tears and watch my nigga fall from greatness
It's all wasted, flushed down the drain and
Soon as the news hit me, I bust out with pain and
Rivers I cried, my brother just died
I'mma see you, my nigga, on the other side




Ah, man, how do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones that have to die
It's hard to live without you, God, I shouldn't have doubted you
When you said that The Passion of Christ was all about you
From the God Mobile, to Linden Plaza, to Brownsville
Florida to Ohio, to Putnam, to Park Hill
You interrupt the Grammy's said "Wu for the kids"
Took four or five shots when they rushed in the crib
Trey-five-seven cracked ya ribs, cops shot ya whip
You've been chased by the pigs, sold the four year bid
Crashed cars, still came out without a scar
They tried to keep ya free spirit trapped in a jar
So you'll keep ya mouth shut, and not tell the world
Who's who and what's what, and probably go nuts
How we treat them hoes? Dirt, how we treat them hoes?
We fuck 'em in the butt, Dirt




But those mistakes behind me
Cast shadows to remind me

*gong bangs*
*Sifu Shi Yin Ming reciting the Heart Sutra*

Still livin' like dat, dat, dat


First and foremost, I be the funneling punishing
Lyrical acrobat, whose quite astonishing
Solar stance on the track, mentals to try me
I snatch your heart right out your chest like Priest Pai Mei


Free from the Killa Bee, who is this I.T.T
With enough cheese, from the city where they rip the beast
With techniques, he seek, build or destroy
White toe on his tag, snatch his flag


Ref techniques, from the force of the transcontinental
Monumental, snatch your soul or your mental
Diamond mic splittin', that's right, the unforgiven
Flying guillotine, rip my raps, where the Killa's at?


We straight out the basement
Double shotgun, left his brains on the pavement
Tasted, the cement ear, he smell it when it's deep
You know when to tuck your heat
And start creep, through the streets with the




I get wicked when I spit it, see the picket signs
Lines of people, they wanna hear it
The dart with the eye in kamosi
Special guest star, Jamel Irief, Afu-Ra
Exhibition, mic spar, for the televised fans
Across the nations, so steal at ten bases
Spin around scratching his crown, gun down
Another sound boy for dead, step in the chamber
Something like Thrilla Manila, but it's iller


It's been a long time, stunnin' and gunnin', let's make it simple
Fifty strikes, light up the mic, make it official
Live your lessons, don't bring your hood up in the temple
Masterin' styles, the spinning kicks and the tripped out physic
Perverted Monks, shining the light, y'all be holding this
My art of design, is silver surf through the cosmo's
I lightsabe my ways, so my flow's can float
My quest for this zest, so yes, to be the rhyme most




No man, no army can calm me, if he cross
He just lost a bet of his life, sent the wrong kite
Watch it where you moving at night, but either way
In the day, you still pray, any way you lay your head


Super kinetic and magnetic, who ready to set it
One with the sun, now tell my mind to take control of the planets
Blazed with the heat behind stars, that's ultraviolet
I'm ready to ride hardcore, just like my style is
Press the venacular, of the highest stature
My lyrical dycatomy --- spectacular
Blum-blum, give it to 'em raw
Listen to the brothers who get rugged and raw

Tell us, who is this refine black queen, eyes so innocent
Vanilla cherry scented, can I get to know you?
Let's exchange digits, slide, so we can kick it
The night is almost over, gave a C note to the chauffeur
Your place, or mines, she said "Mines'll be fine
I rarely find the time to dine and unwind
With working full time, you know, and school, partime
Are you listening?" I said "Yes, love, I'm knowledging
The ball game is on, kinda distracting my attention
Not to ignore you, I didn't mean to bore
Just thought I'd speak less, strive to listen more"
My cheri amore, you make the heart skip a beating
I miss your warm greeting, when we're not speaking
How's L.A. for the weekend, sound?
'Nuff deniro, shopping spree, Reserdero?
Momma said never trust him, it's only logic
I scope out every exit, and open every closet


And you can have anything
Baby, if you roll with me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I choose the best, but for myself
That makes you my queen
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


How beautiful is she to have the God Degree ready?
Veggie stirred fried, with the carrot juice side
Pretty feet, pretty hands, there she lie tanning
Bending with the sand, I docked the yacht
Stepped ashore, greeted the queen
As only a king should, unveiled the hood
Kneel as she stood, before me
She spoke softly, butt ass, she stood naked
With the bow-legged stance, so sexy
Sweet temptation, look how the rain come down
Your hormones pound, you moan with passion
Uteris contracting, time for some action
Cream rising, your breast at attention
Who is the original man? Got your quoting
Lookin' in the mirror, you ride, I hold it open
Short long stroking to death... (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)




And the drama stay major, I need a genie
If you can hold away, then come and see me
I'm guaranteed to make it rain, every spring but ahh
I know you love me, even when you cursing me out
Waited up til the candles burnt out
Ahhh -- please forgive me, I'm out here scrapin'
Drapin' niggas up, stackin' and takin'
A whole lotta paper, it's gonna take years and years
For me to express, the love elevation
The hell we go through, gives me the motivation
To get it right, makin' up at night
It's all worth the aggrivation, black woman through you
I'mma build me a nation, nation... of Gods and Earths (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)




I choose the best, but for myself
That makes you my queen
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lovin' you, it looks so sweet
So sexy, and still discrete
Lovin' you, it looks so sweet
So sexy, and still discrete

How beautiful is she, to have the God Degree ready
Veggie stirred fried, with the cabbage inside
Pretty feet, pretty hands, there she lie tanning
Bending with the sand, I docked the yacht
Stepped a shore, greeted the queen
As only a king should, unvailed the hood
Kneel as she stood, before me
She spoke softly, but as, she stood naked
With the bow-legged stance, so sexy
Sweet temptation, look how the rain come down
Your hormones pound, you moan with passion
Uteris contracting, time for some action

Youre the type of girl that I been dyin to meet


Yo listen, tonight will be exquisite
Behold the beneficent garment
Stitched from the best seamstress
Persian gold woven silk threading
Diamond red rubies in my crown heading
Clark Wally boots sway with the French braid
Preparing for the greeting
Peace princess you truly are a jewel to behold
I would love to have you as my guest, serving you the best
Watching you unwind the pleasures all mine
While Im tasting your sweet words of seduction
And sexual tones I was wondering if I take you home
Would you roll and light my bone for me
Im in the zone while Im watching you dance
And Im thrown by your passionate moans
And the sounds making me

 (Scratches)
So glad I found you
(Youre the type of girl that I been dyin to meet)


Oh she so sexy and she so sweet
This hot little mama I was (dyin to meet)
Oh indeed you are, yes beautiful Comanche squad
My starship taking you up
And Im loving how you flexing
When you stepping in the lobby
Queen royal lioness allow me to express
Your smelling be delicious
Bringing out my hot cool and vicious
Well built butter soft skin hair silk
Intelligent profession, paralegal on your hustle
You need a man to hold you down every now and again
And love you like a genuine friend






My Nubian princess, Arabian incense
All beyond a set, let me collect my thoughts
They so scattered when you not around
Hear you loud and clear when theres not a sound
Your humble cocky walk when your body talk
Cute little socks, Ima knock em off
The soft curve of your smile
Her thighs are like the banks of the Nile
And most cats wanna bend your friends
Not me, I play it cool, never mention them
Check, you got a name for our daughter yet?
Thinking of Nina maybe Juwayriya
My hands rubbing on her area
Her first nine months will be
You and me got something special going
The love our ancestors are knowing
The family is growing baby








Yo, listen, tonight'll be exquisite
Behold the magnificent, garments stitched from the best simstress
Persian gold wolven, silk linen
Diamond red rubies and my crown heavy
Clark Wally boots, suede with the French braid
Preparing for the greeting, peace princess
You truly are a beauty behold
I would love to have you as my guest, serving you the best
Watching you unwind, the pleasure's all mine
While I'm chasing your speed, words of seduction and sexual tones
I was wondering, if (I take you'll home), would you grow in
Over in, I'm in the zone while I'm watching you dance
And I'm thrown by your passionate moans and the sounds making me


Loyalty is royalty, loyalty is royalty
Loyalty is royalty, I'm so glad I found you
So glad I found you


Oh, she so sexy and she so sweet
This hot little mama, I always wanted to meet
Oh, indeed you are, yes, beautiful command your squad
My starship taking you up, I love it how you flexing
When you steppin' in the lobby, cream royal lioness
Allow me to express, she smelling real delicious
Bringing out my hot, cool and vicious
Well built, butter soft skin, hair silk
Intelligent, profession, paralegal on your hardcore
You need a man to hold you down every now and again
And love you like a genuine friend, yeah






The technique depends mainly on arm and finger strength
Once you've that
Then the next step is to learn how to pierce stone
Well you might as well start practicing now
Do you-Do you-Do you-Do you
Do you know, mantis legends?
How it was it all started?
It was fighting off this blackbird
Although it was only a tenth of the bird's size
It was a very valiant insect
And that's why the technique needs a brave man
And a strong one who isn't afraid of odds


Welcome back to the temple of Hip Hop and Sword Kenpo
Lyrical rhyme nympho, b-boy Bob Digital
Diamond crystal ring, solid gold bone rituals
We be the humble, most calmest individuals
Hard to spot microdots, we Sasquatch
Stomp MCs, third eye Cyclops laser beam shots
Being fired once the father get raised up
We John Blaze up, abrasive heat from a phaser gun
Never left for a stun dunn, Atilla the Hun
Type Killa Park Hilla, eighteen wheeler
Macks in the truck lanes from the rugged grains of Shaolin soil
You red wolves be prowling
Howling over the shit that got the whole world bowing
We spoiled, one thousand swordsmen
One thousand recordings, one thousand Wu stores and
One thousand rap tours and global insurance
Not your everyday occurrence
My rhyme torments MCs with the fear of God
You'll be cursed like Farad and struck by the iron rod
Tchka-tchka-tchka-tchka-tchka-tchka-POW

 (x2)
Hell's Wind Staff, the wrath of Black Titans
Niggas battling, sword swinging
Cut-throat women, whirlwind given, save the children
Escape the poverty for living
Let live, die by the mic, shadow skill by night


Man-Mantis style isn't easy to learn
A mantis is small but powerful
With it's arms it can lift up many times it's own weight


On behalf of the Wu-Tang Clan I'll display the Hong Kong
Shaolin King Kong poems
Slaps niggas in half from Kwangtung
Ten Tigers scratch like Allah Math, the Hell's Wind Staff
Watch the Eight Diagram strike the diaphragm
Pierced lung minute funk tongue double-edged, sound the drum
Here I come as predicted
Holding the raw seal, all heads kneel
7th Degree black mic skill is ill, listen to the guns holler
Swallow the shell, East New York terrorist
Break fool to this, madness, crazy low-hand
Grabs the mic stand, smooth as water
Spat Seven Seas you've not yet mastered
Breathe and lungs wheeze, Earth kills
I'm wrecking MCs, blood spills, meadow, is round
The piercing sound of silence deafens ears
Fires fears, wood sharp eagle claw tears
Tree from bark, hard to maintain control
When you leaking, I stand with the strength of Jobe
And hold pressure that'll bust your head, while I'm teaching
Civilization, one having Knowledge
Wisdom Understanding, culture refinement
Not a savage in pursuit of happiness
Thunderous Mantis, all chant this




You are watching a master at work..
(Haha, haha, yeah, haha...)


Steppin' live in the place, smackin' blood out his face
It's the principal, don't get it wrong
What I do to eat, is nothing in comparison
To what I do to keep, self up, right and exact
Sway the mac' if I have to defend the castle
Slang lasso, ropin' them til they recoup
Pass the keys to the Coupe, it's cute for wiz to scoot off, '95 north
Cut from the cloth of king, who bare struggle
In this life line, theology of time
Move with our major motion to the mic
To recite the dart that I have written
Light exists in the darkness, instant gratification
How far can you travel to mic spar?


Water is the softest substance in the world
At yet, it can penetrate the hardest, rock
Or, anything granite, you name it
Umm.. water also is insubstantial; by that I mean
You cannot grasp hold of it, you cannot punch it and hurt it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah...)


See the God light gleam so bright, I gain birth to
That you attract you, heart so fuller
Make you wanna pull your trigger and get rid a
Shiny bald militant head like Lou Gossett
He's walkin' with the shinin' lamp of knowledge
Glory be the law, with the justice sword
Supreme being, all I seeing, radiant son
Imperishable absolute, ya'll salute
Approximately three mil', bodies like an empty vessels
I must fill, check where I came from
Any God seal a Mason is my Sun
In this scene, lesson number one, for the dumb
If he ain't true and living, son, then I never heard of one
Pack your gun, one on one, come and get some


Water... now you put water into a cup..., it becomes the cup
You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle
You put it in a tea pot, it becomes the tea pot
Now water can flow, or it can crash..
Be water, my friend... (yo, heh, yo)


Yo, I thought the sign read: "No colors allowed"
Well how then, give me a few, just listen
Instead of wasting time, try'nna grab them back
The dominant magnetic will always attract
The under-life, quoting him, describe the beat
Now Eminem, for example, just another sample
Of your worst nightmare, coming back at you
So beautiful designed, the places of time, to see
Everything that has been, always will be
Now figure out the riddle, the never ending cycle
Born in his self, back into the circle
I'm thankful for the blessing, testing of the lessons
Answers and questions, trials and tribulations
That were set upon me, it's hard for some to see
But it's clear as day to me..


Be water, my friend..



Peace
This is the motherfucking high chief Jamel Arief
I represent the Wu-Tang Clan kid
Tony Touch, 50 MC's
Wu-Killa Bee collaboration
For the nation...

Intriguing to the ear, but bitter to the heart
As I begin to take part in the art of dart throwing
Starring the Wu-Tang swordsman
Day two breaks, it's a stormy monday
My ninjas lay in revines and ditches
Underneath shrubs and leaves they breathe through underwater wreaths
The enemy walks above, I remain sub-terrained in mud
Off-shore banks tanks approach the location
Bombed by the circle of death formation
Communication lines are sniped from these low altitude strikes
And large inhalements of shrapnel, fragments of shell
Inhale these highly venomous thoughts that I propel
Through the north facility, the city must suffer
At the hands of the chief's command volts are sent
At three minute intervals the heat intenses
Deadening the power from electrical fences
The fences are down, knowledge material lies through the sound
Revealing the skill that causes the ground to tilt, feel the tension
Blistering quills are scorching
You could never stomach the eruption of god dimension
Science is the study of all things
Knowledge my sword swing, guns go off in the east wing
It's a blessin' to deliver this lesson
Who's restin'?, you've been summonsed to awaken
A nation of sleeping giants who are clients to the devil's civilization
Migration expands my plan to the maximum capicity
Killarmy, nothing can hold we
From launchin' out over the earth and disperse
In the triple darkness niggas return unscathed
At ease and as you were
But the thought of be able to breathe and leave these worldly possessions
Have emcees fret to step in my direction




It's original, everything we do
Everything we do, is original
It's from the heart, that's right
Always remember that, we keep it original
That's right, the foundation


We was known for sad love ballads and guns
The rude one beg no friend, the selection's threatening
Never hesitate, dusty murder gun, tray eight
Bust head, known to regulate
War physically on the rule to rule a date
All I can recall was white and bright lights
The doctors and nurses, drunked the old earth
And killed the pain of the breech birth
Under the influence, I arrived at Brooklyn Jewish
Now a tree grows, standing ovation
Peace signs, salute to my nation
Brooklyn, it's good to be home
Gun shot blown, stay calm, don't be alarmed
Respect is being shown, for real
Weight like six sex till, followed by the walk-by
Intensify pressure apply to the hands that hold mics
Strike like the Pai Me Nine


Peace, my nigga (yeah)
That's that funny style ass nigga over there
Ain't nothin' changed, still hot out here
Snitches...


It's about 90 degree, in the project
Two bedroom, no A.C., God Degree low
Metal fans spinnin' hot air slow
I refuse to go, I'm determined to build
Watch me turn gas into million stacks of cash
Never lost on the cook-up, niggas can't walk the grounds
From which they came
Foundation never was strong, you ain't the same
Brothers is doing real time, it's not a game
Straight poet, no comeback, check out how the fiends react
Yo, shots lick, Wu lots and Nash' fit
Not many walk the streets, if not, few deep
Niggas get robbed by bitches in they sleep
He didn't understand, how well connected
How fast that ass get sent to the essence
My mic blessing, from the 120 Lesson
Crys' and the Henny' to seed, when I breath
One Blood, guest star me and Junior Reid
Meet me at the highest peak, God Mountain
Twenty nine thousand and some, from the Slum
They love gun, who you think taught 'em how to bust them, son?
Yo, who you think taught 'em how to bust them, son?


Yo, yeah, that's how they do it
When I'm writing I'm trapped in between the lines
I escape, yo...
Chill with the feedback, black we don't need that
Nah, they don't need that bullshit
Heh, shame on you, when you step through to
Ya'll muthafuckas know


Bullet fragment, the colorful brain has his name
He earned that stripe, no question, that's his lesson
Cut amongst organizations, then snitched?
You bitch, actin' like you thug and...






On my merry way from her merry go round
Mary hold it down, best in the town
On my merry way from her merry go round
Mary hold it down, best in the town
You deserve a crown, best in the town
Queen of the sound, best in the town
You deserve a noun, best in the town
Queen of the sound, Mary hold it down
You deserve a crown, queen of the sound
Mary hold it down, on my merry way
On my merry way from her merry go round
Mary hold it down, best in the town


My people like word up, my people like word up
Shorties with they skirt up we kill it and shoot the hearse up
Brothers like act right, brothers like act right
Hit em with that mag life flash light for the act right
Live from the session, had to make em guess huh?
This is not a lecture, live from the sector
Jam with the passion the heart reflect the fashion
We could get our bash on, brass knuckles to bash on
Here and there we takin it everywhere
The room with heavy stares, your petty cares
Now and then, here and there we takin it everywhere
The room with heavy stares we piss on your petty cares




Put thought together like punches, build quotes, combine notes
Every sentence properly cemented
Asia like black spliffed it
Young gifted with the gab as my brothers say
Feng shui I lived the realm another day, its still real
I await the thought it takes shape far from the mind
Then design a rhyme that I bore into existence
Simplistic, nothin complicated
No set dated, long I waited, supreme clientele
Pizza chit bang 4-5-6 and the dice
You know my rhymes slice my mic cock his head shot
My whiz hold a pretty Glock heads bob, beats knock
Son, this is show shot, blow until your speakers pop




Ok, turnin on the stereo, murder at the Marigold
Shootin at the stars, burnin at the burial
21 gun salute, punks uncomfortable
What? What? Fuck the booth, rappin in the casket
An underground nigga, shit, Shaq made a classic
Nigga love the sound when the killins by a masta
Me and my niggas livin already
Supposed to be dead or in prison already
Cant see me like sous storm
We do it up until anomalies is the new norm, learn somethin
Slap a kid with a book light, turn somethin
Eryday and send him on his merry way





 (x2)
If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome


The whole world trippin', listen it's still a cold world
The other day I had to bury my homegirl
Wrong place, caught one in her face
Plus her man's on the run and couldn't come to the wake
For Heaven's sake, you pray God open the gate
In this modern day Sodom, that's their only escape
10 year olds are cold, no, they don't hesitate
2 up a G pack, he chose the whole 8
Catch a 5 to 10 sellin' 5's and 10's
And the police informer was your childhood friend
In the real world, gotta hustle for your dream
Extend your clips, fit the muzzle with the beam
For the love of cream, it's nothin' but routine
Swing on the judge, take a couple for the team
He's the young Capone, he grew up in a drug home
Stranded on the Ave with a blunt and his gun shown


If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome


A live scene theme from a Godfather saga
A Martin Scorsese classic and I'm the author
Drama at the opera, crime story novel
Tuxedo suit and silencer on the nozzle
Meeting place scheduled at the Broadway musical
Bravo, we arrive in bulletproof limo
Shotgun, the underboss of our main source
Of interest, the black widow cocaine empress
A princess rich from her family's inheritance
Now let's talk business, begin by addressin' the bricks
That was missin' in the last shipment
At first, everything nice, everything routine
Jocks lining up the food, we blessed him with the cream
But on this day he wasn't ready and my God sense keen
I noticed that his normal firm handshake shook
It wasn't steady when he squeezed


If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome


He went from prince to a king out of a life of rubbish
Wearin' tailor-made suits, Sky Dwellers and clusters
To perfection, rags to riches, the evil's done influenced
That pushed him off the edge, they said the greed made him do it
You're my right hand, damn, he fucked the trust up
It's ruined, niggas caught him slidin' on his belly
I'm grippin' on my hammer with the silencer twisted
Contemplatin' murder now, I'm 'bout to swerve on my biscuit
But it's my man at the same time, I don't wanna do him
He violated, broke a major code, bar what you stealin' now
It's over, in the falls of Niagara, he was soakin'
With a shell case stuck in his head, they found him floatin'


If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome


Allah let me lay in your arms
Hold me like a newborn
Sing to me the most sweetest song
The exalted, the most benevolent
The knower of all
Keep me safe 'till I return back to your residence
This Earth, my place of birth
As time went through the ages it got worse
Sicknesses, beheadings in Syria
Ebola's killin' my people, it's gettin' scarier
Most foods ain't even real, the chip is here
Deadly fluids bein' released, contracted through air
Dear God, it been a minute since I cried out
Since mama died, I never wild out
We need help like the phone's 'bout to die out
Can you hear me? Can you hear me now?
We need a miracle
Destroy the FDA for holdin' back cures
So they can get paid


If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome




Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home


Yeah yeah they want me locked down, fryin' in jail
Before you hear that I decided to tell, I'd rather die in a cell
I was framed like a wedding flick, 2 time felon
Still a predicate, doin' time, tell 'em that's a negative
Prejudice judge, bails be a mil' in cash
Scorin' money like the meter on the Yellow Cab
Give the witness an unexpected visit
Make his story change like walls blockin' his vision
Couldn't give a clear description, fearin' the repercussions
Like, "I was on the ground, I ain't see him bustin'"
Now the DA chasin' a plea, they hatin' I'm free
The case is mistaken identity


Whoever push me like Pusha T, I push back
I push a cap, before '93, I pushed crack
I'm hood, black, you know me well, what's good, scrap?
I'm smokin' rappers, you are a L, what's good Smack?
Hold up that's Goodz rap, pardon self
I just like good rap, but when I see Goodz I give his goods back
I rap for writers that pack strap to rhymers that backpack
To 25 to lifers that jack MAC
We movin' ratchets, no Kat Stacks, it's magic
The way we flip the package before the coppers can catch it
I'm past that chapter in life, let's live it lavish
When life take a piss in your bed, you flip the mattress
Before you try and get my head, get you some Pampers
Then take a long look at my ish and get your answers
Kick in my vicinity, I'm what rappers pretend to be
Charge 'em with a penalty, mistaken identity


Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy


Fresh off of work, he jumped out the van
Two suitcases, dangle from his hands
He opened up the door, headed up the stairs
Thought he heard a noise, but no one else was there
First sight he saw, struck him by surprise
Two shots was given, between his girl's eyes
Windows blown out, no prints on the door
All he seen was blood stains, smear the damn floor
911, ambulance showed up
Blood everywhere, paramedics throwin' up
Cops cuffed him up, hit him with the charge
But he was bangin' Mrs. Prixy at the Motor Lodge
He got his alibis, gonna use 'em all
He screwfaced the judge, he might take the fall
Someone set him up, a botched robbery
Mistaken identity, yeah it gotta be


17 years old, I'm headed back to the hole
I'm mistaken identity, every way was sold
I look like a hoodlum, I rock a lot of gold
They lockin' everybody up, ship your ass up the road
I ain't have a 9 on me, they was lyin' on me
Court day with my old bird, they was spyin' on me
Tried to set me up, plantin' coke in my pocket
The beast pat me up, they won't let me off


Na-n-n-n-n-nah it wasn't me
It could never been the G-O-D, not me
You terribly mistaken, son, I ain't the one
We could never look nothin' like, whether near or far sight
What resemblance does he strike? So my mic Fahrenheit
W for my a-alike, your DNA match tight
Even if they bite us, close but not quite
They still tryna get it right, mistaken identity


Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy



Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
Wanna go home..
Wanna go home..
Wanna go home..
Wanna go home..


Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy




Perverted Monks style
'99 style, knowhatimsayin?
Coming at cha, this how we do


Paraplegic, my fighting stance too strategic
No shadows on my kicks too much Chi horrific
To be specific, I'm coming through with jujitsu
Bone crushing bone breaking as I get into
Scorpion styles, with the speed of a cheetah
Hit your pressure points with light skills, I be
The blaster, Iron Palms is elemental
Combinations damaging nations in the mental
Cerebral cortex is obsolete
You'll die ten times if you try to test me
Taoist master, rhyme style disaster
Studied on the cliffs of mountains reading scrolls
Holding it down, iron shirt chigung
Apprentice in the temple with Guang Jung Nim
I went through torture deadly styles I'm the author
Ingested metals, yeah they made me supernova
Triple spinning kicks, side kicks and hook kicks
They come much iller, so you must be Masta Killa


It's Afu, change my style, change the weather
It's Afu, change your mind, just too clever
It's Afu, all the weak styles I sever
Combinin two styles on the mic with Masta Killa


The great ones have searched for the righteous data
To show and prove and master the separation of matter
And seeing through death, never loose conscious of self
Shed a shell keep it moving factor
Sword swinging the temple mental state
Danger chamber, eighth yang slang, Wu-Tang
Train private soldiers in this rap game
Like that Shanghai chinky eyed chick from Bed-Stuy
Wing Chung from Lafayette, Stuyvesant and Malcolm X
Fifty Seven Park, it might spark, it's the heart
One blood cell, featuring Masta Kill
After dark he goes, bust gone, trust none, touch one
Young chun, prodigal son, Killa Beez disease
Home grown, flown from over seas, city under siege
Ya eyes bleed, the weed got 'em red dread
Like spinning roundhouse kicks to the head, he dead






Yeah, yo, there's a dozen ways to die, six million ways to do it
Let's go through it, my mind flow like fluid
Torture, chop your legs up, thrown off the boat
Guillotine, nigga, one chop to the throat
Suffocation, saran wrapping your face
Buried alive, throw a few nails in the case
Manslaughter, eight degrees of separation
Leave your body chopped up in a piece, that's mutilation


Six million ways to die, cyanide in your drink
Catch a Cuban necktie for your mink
Dahmer style, cut up and stuffed in the fridge
And maybe washed up ashore and found under the bridge
Hit him with the whip, drag him half a block
Machete or the sock full of padlocks
Chainsaw, switch your medication
Stomp a nigga out til he one with the pavement


Torture, he's gruely peaking at the meeting
Suspicions of him being a rat? Even worse than cheating
I'm cold reaking of ice picks, scratch and sticks and closed fists
Brassknuckle steel toe kicks
Cracked ribs, punctured lungs, hard breathing
He's gasping and wheezing for air, his breath he can't catch
He clinches the shirt on his chest
In a dying effort to reveal his last will before he was killed


First things first, I chop your head to your fingertips
Butcher knife your torso, chop up your ligaments
Make sure it's legitimate, conceal all my fingerprints
Chop, chop your body up quick then get rid of it
A hole in the desert, body bag, just polluted it
Your miss was a snitch too? Shotgun killed the bitch
Leave her in the wilderness, suffocated and scarred up
Your brother want more too, blow his fucking car up


Another homocide city, murder mystery efficiently
Delete your fucking history broke bone, missing teeth
Throw bones, it's slippery, brings on the triple beam
All topped and chopped up, my luck is a Mr. Clean
Clorax and vicious steam sterilized the whole scene
Photograph your death so I can spread it to your whole team
Won't leave a trace of evidence for the case
It's sinister to finish it, hit with the man with no face


Red wine and pink veal
Unknowing that this would be his last meal
Comfortable hes made to feel, six inch stiletto heel
Kept his refills filled
Titties like big ass, kept him still for the real deal
Hitman from Brooklyn, Tommy gun specialist
Our one accomplice, sipped Courvoisier at the bar
Then waited till she lit a cigar
Then sprayed
In shattered wine glass he lay, he never saw it coming


Yo, murder one, bullets went fast through the flesh
I cocked the sawed off shotty, put a hole in your chest
Blow your lungs out, I've seen you been smoking for years
You got no heart, I'll hunt you down like Cape Fear
Push your brains out the back of your head, blow off your hands
Leave your body in a dumpster, head in the trashcan
Cell catching scene look clean as a whistle
Ghost carved through your skin tissue til the bone grizzle




Yeah, yo, there's a dozen ways to die, six million ways to do it
Let's go through it, my mind flow like fluid
Torture, chop your legs up, thrown off the boat
Guillotine, nigga, one chop to the throat

Butcher knife your torso, chop up your ligaments
Make sure it's legitimate, conceal all my fingerprints
Chop shop your body up quick, then get rid of it
A hole in the desert, body bag, just filled the ditch
Your miss was a snitch too? Shotgun killed the bitch
Leave her in the wilderness, suffocated and scarred up
Your brother want more too, blow his fucking car up


Another homocide city, murder mystery efficiently
Delete your fucking history, broke bones, missing teeth
Blow bones to smithereens, brings on the triple beam
All topped and chopped up, mop buckets and Mr. Clean
Clorax and vicious steam sterilized the whole scene
Photograph your death so I can spread it to your whole team
But won't leave a trace of evidence for the case
It's sinister to finish it, hit with the man with no face

Crack that pineapple open
Vision of break faces, gettin' money lay in the boats
Got big rifles, play the hood, ride Benz cycles

Meet the real, we lock the real, me/him lock the steel
Pop off, pull out, drop them bills

Drape a nigga up with the ratchet, less talkin'
Caught him on the 'nard, bomb like a G. hard
Explosion rocks the Promenade, I'm God
And he show and provin', 'knowledge how he movin'
Smift as the wisdom, move from my gate in a drunken state
I wrote this degree, adjust ya eyes in the light so you could see
Never fall victim, dictate the fate

Fine wine hundred proof, spittin' mine at you

She stood out like 5'3", sexy as she wanna be me
I'm in the cut didn't think she could see
She approach politely and asked "Could I assist"
-] "In a dance wit her and her Sis"
How can I resist an offer so grand ?
She said they need a man, to stand
Why they lock hands
Sounds like a plan wit ya Golden son Tan
Her sista is like pecan brown
She from Uptown, lil sis strokin' my back
I'm in the middle wit the Two step
Leavin' it simple, On and on party til we break


Yea we get drunk and we stay high
We known to take Money and keep the fam fly
Guns still bust so please don't try
All my ladies scream butterfly, tho' yo hands high


Yea you rollin' wit live from Brooklyn, it's the Squad
Hard hittin', face slittin', guns tottin'
They let them niggas in the party ?
DAMN! they gon' fuck it up
Brothers ain't *?Corrupt?* it's just how we came up
Rough, tough from the City
Pretty ass Pats, strung hung myself young
When I think back sometimes - I wanna roll one
Just blow one - and sit back
Unwind, kill a lil time, you know ?


Yea cuz we get drunk and we stay high
We known to take Money and keep the fam fly
Guns still bust so please don't try
All my ladies scream butterfly, tho' yo hands high


So peace, Happy Physical day, if it's your Birthday
More power moves to make, cake to take
Be Thankful for the food you ate, let's Celebrate
People on the Ecstasy - Please don't OD (Overdose)
It's really not Healthy for your body and Mind
Come wind, wind, wind
Pretty young ladies let your Mind float
To another place, taste raw dope
Track is like Coke - Niggas slingin' Soap
Compare to what I wrote - NOPE!




I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Five score years ago, a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today


Look, homicide is illegal, death is a penalty
Never let go when you've got ahold of your enemy
Eagle claw cobra clutch by any means necessary
Ill never let it go, see my shadow ninja mic flow
I throw a great archer dart arrow to your temple
Almighty bow of Ulysseus the indigenous
Plan of the Wu-Tang Clan became a world brand
We never let it go, we talk a half a mil a show


Never let go of your mind
Its a terrible thing to waste
To lose, but its very hard to find
Being that ignorance is lethal
We must touch hearts, tune souls, harmonize the people
Never let go of your plan, execute
So when you shoot, inspire everyone on the land
Never lose knowledge of yourself
For it may become risk to your health
And great loss of wealth


Never let go of your cream, never let go of your dream
Players retire, but they never let go of the team
If you a rider then you never let go of that thing
Pull up your mans like you better let go of that bling
This lifes crazy, too many life sentences, maybe
Fatherless babies on the block but they father 380
Thats just the hood lately, never let go
Im what the hood made me
Momma told me to find a good lady


Never let go of staring at the death
Like yo, that's your best blow
I still hold on like En Vogue
The cold go to war with the heat
Eyes wide, never falling asleep
All the talking is cheap
Call'em, ultimate warrior, W.W.F
I come up victorious, struggle is nothing to Deck
Set it straight for the seeds, to see a better new
Take the real life by the rings and I aint letting go
I aint letting go


No matter what the odds be
No matter how hard we
You never let go


Never let go of the fight, never let go of the mic
My honesty, my values, my loyalty, my pride
And memory of those who have passed to the other side
Never letting go, Im never letting go of my beliefs
My faith, convictions, real
Both hands holding on, never let go the wheel
We hood legends, misunderstood
These lessons, learned
Growing up for manhood
Keep focus on the prize what you better do
A little taste of heaven, sunshine is where we headed to
States whats ahead of you, always on the schedule
Smoke the gold leaf down to the residue
Letting go, is something that I never do
Those who let go, live life regrettable
Never let go of your hope or your rope
Eyes on the prize, never let go of the scope
When Im in jail, never let go of the soap
Hold on, boy, never let go


Never let go, the all-eye-seeing, the supreme
Never let go the love of your seeds, or your queen
Never let go your heart, or the place you started
The feeling that I had, Wu-Tang had just charted
The old earth departed, I give thanks to the martyrs
I never let go the love I have for thy father
Never let go the glow
The more I know the more that it shows
I wont let go, even if I decompose
Your seed will carry it on, we need to carry it on
Pass the baton, life is just the marathon
And ain't' playing to win it, its an epidemic
Never let go, thats what the god recommended




And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. Who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. For many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom






Im tryna see whats between your thighs
You might feel something if you just close your eyes
So good, yea you make a nigga wanna cry
No matter baby, I will fly
No matter how far, love
No matter how far you are


Across seas, climbed over mountains
Traveller, seeker of youth fountain
News mounting we true bout it
Boo bouncing out of the blue, figured out it was you
From Kalamazoo, the walk and stare
Scare raising your hair an amazing affair
Goosebump in the moonlight blurry the glare
Giving ghosts a good reason to appear
What a mirage, weaving word collage
Even out the odds, a taste for a taste
Feel the muscles in your face relaxe
Unwind, one time, erase your whole mind
Black sand beach, fall in love with your feet
The wind whispers in your ear to creep
What you doing? Dont speak
Words might ruin what this passion pursuing, babe




Shit you are my distant star
No matter how far I produce light
Then recite it through the rhyme mic
Receive it in the bearer of life
You are my shining diamond
Im cosigning down payment on arrangements
To take you, mould you and shape you and date you
Why would I play you, I made you
Think it through, you and I slide in Dubai, so fly
Sipping on whatever you do, I hold the Dom P
A spliff for that OG
Watching you dance so exotic to the music
Seductively you loosen your blouse, Im 'bout to lose it
Talking dirty lingo, we tango to the beat of the maestro
And sit back let the time flow, you know






Uh, now without disturbing our guest, moving casual
My mens vested, underneath they're double-breasted
Business as usual, nothing personal, punctual, seizing your lobby
Right on schedule, Gods took, tired and stripped
Uniform switched, I'm still entertaining this chick
But I don't trust shit, sipping 'paine, checking her frame
I'm brain picking for a quick sec, the lights clicked off
Music stopped, crowd moans, what's going on, she says
Ok, everything resumes a norm, computer room took now we in the system
The vault got a hundred million, ninja men scaling the ceiling
The building owned by the billionaire King Don Amondrion
He sold arms, had his hands in all wealth
Private jets, fleets of the best stretch, Benz, Lex
Jewel thief, he made millions off petroleum
He had diamond mines, robbing them blind, the feds owed him favors
So he hired Keisha, but the juks is already on
Swiftly, they moved in the don, politely
He's being escorted by an armed soldier, no one even noticed
Everything calm, nothing alarmed, couples mingled
As nothing was going on, but a few of the don's men
Sensed something was wrong, so wanna approach him with a smile
The don, told him carry on, he saw that his king was in check
And one wrong move could mean death, so he backed up
To round his crew up, now meanwhile back in VP status
Shorty winding, bump and grinding, sipping Sangria
Suddenly, the hour became Amaretto Sour, but son came to whisper
Keisha, I think we need ya, the don has been taken
She jumped quick, slip the 2-5 from her guard
And cocked it back, slick, gave a look, if she was trynna figure
Is he down? Worth attentions wrong, for a quick sec
Gave the perfect opportunity, for a smooth exit
They had the don with the mack to his head
We want the code to the vault they said
Now nervously his hand shakes, his heart racing
He fumbles with the combination, time wasting
So they smacked him, had him leaking from the nose
They told him, one false move, and your whole team goes




Time to ride..
Yo... yeah..
Lord, when you droppin'?

 x2
No said date, no said date, no said date
No said date, no said date (Lord, when you dropping?)
No said date, no said date


They said the God wasn't never comin' home
Grandma in a nursin' home, my mind is blown
I'm known to walk alone, but the fam
It's deep, yeah we all love heat
These military arm' marine, sub machine gun
Legend of Brooklyn, master craftsman
Lord, when you dropping?" No said date
Thought premeditated, well calculated
The air's been tested, the people can't wait
So, ahh - we agreed to send one, to swim from lost and found
See truth be the life preserve, we can't drown
Drunk with the victory, the Wu cavalry
Bomb the seminar, the last "hoo-ra" for chivalry
Classical, Yo-Yo Ma, laced in the bulletproof fabric
Crafted and mastered in space
What better place of birth than the Earth
When a star is born, but the path was narrow
Float across the Verrazano, stack ya ammo
Hit 'em while we got the muscle, in the streets we hustle
For survival, watch the God reign, build me a brain
Support it with a physical frame, imperial Asiatic material
Scratch the serial, smoking him, he gonna need a miracle
Prepare for burial, it's time, .45 to your head, drop your nine
We came to collect, the debt is overdue yo
Set to connect with Deck, we pushin' through
Yvette with the red Corvette from Lafayette
Pussy stay wet and she hold Tec
Respect to the six, she sexy wit a switch
Gun never stick when 'victions for the brick
Shots lick

 x2


Heh, yo, this is No Said Date
Peace, I'm Jamel Arief, pleasure to meet you
Not to offend you, something for the mental
Straight from the Shaolin Temple, so simple
Ain't enough ink for the thoughts I think
They travel so rapid, it's hard to grasp it
No assumption, Kay Slay get the shit thumpin'
Darts stay lethal, blaze one for the people
They traveled so far to witness
The killin' of a mastermind line-for-line
Half-time, center stage, 50 yard line
Long time, man for dead
Should've been, put one in his head
Before the poison spread to the body
Partly done, 'nough said... 




Yo God I got the Top Ten
Yo God - Quiet down, I got the Top Ten Liquor
Yea yea, y'all, yea, Peace Gods
Peace to the Gods, Yea Peace to the Gods
Up here chillin' wit Jamel Irief LIVE!!

When Individuals that didn't know they Math wasn't allowed to come Outside
You remember them days ?


Yea God man, you know what we had to do God)
Ain't no forgot we had to make them show and improve, yea be honest without
A doubt)


Just to show and improve everythin' was real
We had to keep this in its text
In order to make a seed grow you gotta constantly water it
And that Water was the Knowledge that we had
Through extensive Research we obtained and we gave it to the Young


Yea God, you know that See Allah..
Allah Believed if you taught Nine People
And that Nine People taught Nine People
And that Nine People taught Nine People
Guess What (That's right)


Let the track wind in your Mind, flow free
Remain Conscience on this rock 'til your best Ability
Infinity, back to your Saucer that you came
Energy see a change form, Atoms being born, neva endin'
All on and on and on, travel wit me
Not tryin' to convince the pack that it's a fact
But for those that can adapt, I live it, shit it and back
We have agreed, you'll feel the impact of the truth
Now squeeze the bain 'til something pop
Hip-Hop, Glocks and Tech's, Fat Checks
Fly Whip Chicks, Fresh Kicks, especially Fitted Crown
Wouldn't down, Open White Tee underneath
.9's and .4 Pounds, 45 Minutes of Menacin'
Dismantling any MC opponent steppin' in the Zone
Get ya Face Blown


I would like to let y'all know the History
Of how the first Bones Began
Allah Met Messiah - Allah Met Bismillah
Allah Met Prince Salam - Allah Met Uehara
Allah Met Akbar - Allah Met -] Kaheem
Allah Met Abiji - Who was Black -] at the time
Allah Met Al-Jamal - Allah Met Salam
And that's Three Elders that dealt with this Knowledge with him
And these Three Elders was - Fred Bone Justice Who was Akbar
He had Shaheem - and He had each beaker
Along wit each 12 - We became the 13th Men from 12 Disciples
I like to let y'all know from my Perspective
That the Mathematics was Revealed to us by Almighty God Allah
He gave us One and Nine, and A to Z


When I speak to wake the Mourn
That should surely die fuckin' wit I
Stealin', tellin' lies, to Master the Original Man
Home and Abroad the Sword is stay Justice
Reward is the price of food and Tony Blair
That killed Fred Hampton in Bed
Penalties to Enemies couldn't musket the seal in they heads
Show and Prove, make the mouth move
We build wit the MC Skill, Drop Math, nuttin' grabbed
Crafted - Mastered for the people
Then sling to the Rhythm if you feelin' what I'm givin' is real
True livin' Iron Pole, Microphone Steel
Thought Imprisonment, Big Business for Government Officials
Address the Issue, blow the Whistle
Take your face, value how fast the light travel
Swan Poison Animal eaters and Wife Beaters
Savage and Pursuit, false move and I'll shoot
Blast you, back to gas you, you can't last in the square wit the Truth


And that's Peace God
It always comes back to Knowledge
And that Knowledge is our Foundation
And the Foundation of all Life emanated from Allah - The Father
Manifested himself as a true and livin' God
Throughout Eternity - or even time Immortal
Man has always been God - 'Fore we under Supreme Being
Manifested and Taught by Almighty God Allah


Another Start Child is Born, Straight from the Vine
Before there was time, someone had to wind the Clock
And it's Understood, Wit the Body of the Universe
No Religion, just Universal Law
Wit except Existence, everythin' right in Exact
Universal Flag tagged up in your Head piece




I want two beef patties, special sauce, onions, tomatoes
Lettuce, on a sesame seed bun... on a a sesame seed bun, you big dummy!
Dah-dah-dah-deh-duhhhhhh (I want two beef patties)
Dah-dah-dah-deh-duhhhhhh (with onions... special sauce)
Dah-dah-dah-deh-duhhhhhh (cheese on the special sauce sesame seed bun!)
Dah-dah-dah-deh-duhhhhhh (you big dummy!)
Dah-dah-dah-deh-duhhhhhh


I rock the mic and make the crowd said "Ho!"
People if you ready to ride, then let's go
The older the wine, the more vintage
Each sentence, mature like stock dropped on beat
Sold in it's highest peak, the black panther
Call him for the answer, the Shadow Dancer
No cure for the cancer, carefully approach this near-ville approach
Tension in the street, we stressed and wanna eat
Supply, meet the demand for those who get high
Sly & the Family, carve my name in Stone, peace to Angie
On and On, Chief Jay Strong'
.44 long, state today's math and what's ya name born
The Abbott had his head reflectin' off the chrome
Bank loan for a mil', Oprah, hold me down like Dr. Phil


This is napsack rap, oint joint gas
My gats point at you now you can't point back
Penetratin' skulls, I'm diggin' holes like the mole
My sword will not dull
My daily toil's: to protect the Earth so the seeds won't spoil
Ya Frankenstein type mind like Peter Boil
Hooked on that Power-U, money, weed, power, too
Powerful God-U, fine booze, lines of snooze 
Clouds of smoke, we smoke to daybreak
We keep the leaves soaked, in that PC
Y'all best to run when y'all see me
I'm like Godzilla stompin' through Mt. Fiji
On his way to Tokyo
You hollow block head tell lies like Pinochio
Flip the Nokio phone, call my nigga T.S
"How you want the Triple X rock cut? V.S.?"
Or Princess, or simply solid
The Prince word is worth more than the wallet


Doggy doggy! We'll steal your bone!
Doggy doggy! We'll steal your bonnnne!
Doggy doggy! We'll steal your bone!
Doggy doggy! (I said!) We'll steal your bone!


I said, two beef patties, special sauce
Onions, tomatoes, lettuce on a sesame seed bun
On a sesame seed bun, you big dummy!!
Dah-dah-dah-deh-duhhhhhh
Dah-dah-dah-deh-duhhhhhh
Dah-dah-dah-deh-duhhhhhh
Dah-dah-dah-deh-duhhhhhh




Modern vampires of the city, hunting blood
Blooood, blood, bloooood.. blooood
You coulda from Rema, or ya come from Jungle
You coulda come from Fire House or
You come from Tower Hill
One bloood, one bloood, one bloood


I was rollin, showin my age, unshaven
Rugged with my Timberland boots that paid
I walk with a slight lean from the weight of my heat
Givin a green to shine infra-red beam
At the street traffic light recorders
Takin pictures of our corners
Cameras on the side of the buildings, we destroy 'em
The Chameleon throws cream to children, out the window
We movin in unmarked vans, disguised as a light tan
With plastic faces and rubber hands
Fuck fame, I shoot a hole in a 50 cent piece to test my aim
How dare you call the Gods in vain
Not knowin the seriousness of this and why I came
To Earth, feet first
I dare you lion tame to the beat of the drum
No questionin to the session, I walk with gun
The magnum'll bust his head from many directions unknown
Another statistic, change the ballistics
On the nozzle, make em goggle and swallow
Scrape the craters of the brain for data
Old scriptures on withered paper
Beginnin take shape and form
When the Gods get on it and crash your college dorm


You coulda come from uptown, or you come from downtown
You coulda come from outta town, or you come from 'round town
One bloood, one blooood, one blooooood
The fussing and fighting
The tribal war, racial war
Cause bloooood, blooood


Now verse 2, even more deadly than the first
Unrehearsed raw footage part 2 for you
I give this dedication, project elimination
Here's a burnt offering, nothing up my sleeve
I'm just vanishin with the vanishin cream
Here's jewels to live by
Identify before you enter and can't leave with weed
Fuck that, we waste no time in search of those who can't breathe
A bomb only has one time to explode
When I break I'm takin everything
Turn the city streets to Dusty Rhodes
Behold this return of the Invincible Tone
Rude like Governor Tuse and King Toustume
Who gave the order to bust 'em?
Don't ask this is Genuine Draft
Blueprint ultimate legit sting international, stone love classical
Comin back, to attack in black fatigue
Wu-Tang and Junior Reid


You coulda come from Lebanon, or ya come from Iran
You coulda come from China, or ya come from Japan
One blooood, one blooood, one blooood
You coulda come from uptown, or ya come from down sout'
You coulda come from outta town, or ya come from round town
One bloood, one blooood, one blooood
The fussing and fighting
Tribal war, racial war
Cause bloood, blooood, bloood
Mothers fighting daughters every day
Fathers fighting sons
Sisters hating sisters
Rappers getting murdered, every day
You coulda come from Lima, or come from Georgia
You coulda come fire outside or come from Hawaii
One bloood, one blooood, one bloooood
You coulda come from Brook-a-lyn, or you come from Bronx
You coulda come from queens, or ya come from Jersey
One bloood, one bloood, one bloood
You coulda come from Long Island, or ya come from Philly
You coulda from Canada, or ya from from over south
One bloood, one bloood, one bloood



With so much drama imma have to refocus 
Symptoms of a coma sleeping awaking baking
I drop bombs like Hiroshima
Elegant and  face bumping in mines
All she wanted to do is getting side
Than she got a side talking about "Let me ride"
I stay regulating since craytons was the daytons
Free Tracey Davis TC is chill
Cause ain't no fun if the homies can't have noone
And if Kurupt gave a fuck about a biatch
They already know that I don't fuck with no busters
And I don't fuck with no and I don't fucking no
So don't ask me shit, ain't give a fuck about a damn

Yelling one eight seven with my dick in her mouth biatch (x2)

The echo chamber enhance the flow wit the block party
Keep an MC head spinning like Dark Bacardi
This B.A.C. is 2.3
Now the liver's damaged, but his lungs are joint free
So inhale, exhale, breathe and get well
Kick something live stop chirping like Nextel
I'm All In Together, a swordsman forever
I paint the town red, with many heads are severed
R-A-W, I still bring trouble to
Throw your raps in the sleephold, quick to smother you
Dart heat your breastplate, meet ya death date
Rook down a E4, look, it's checkmate
No other way to describe a catastrophe
The plan was drawing blood and displayed it graphically
Direct order, hit the border, then slaughter
Horrific torture, by prolific authors
Shape and mold MC's, like I'm playing the skelly top
It's getting 'hot in here' like the single that Nelly dropped
So take ya clothes off, the track is so soft
A little vodka turn 'em into Ivan Koloff
Why do the Gods make MC's study from
Thirty five, and fifty year, then try to become
Under the study with the sword above the head
So he would keep in mind under the open pledge


Fierce glisten, something so sharp
Piercing, swords cling, the vigilante intimate
Close combat, this is emceeing at its best
But there is no contest, sent I'm this
Speaking of a test, this and try to question this
He so different with the swiftness, godfather civilization
Shell casing, universal nation
Could he be the one predicted, presidential sent in
Old school soul survivors, we the wildest
Asiatic Arctic flow is so frigid


Is it, the Zig Zag, I'mma pay you a visit
Somehow mistake me as an old wise wizard
Word? I'm not the same
I go somewhere, don't remember how I came
Is it the weed, the hash or the 'caine?
Or the Digi being stained on my brain
Appear from a cloud of smoke, the voter's on choke
If surrounded, seven men drop from one stroke
Even if my feet was shackled down to one handcuff
To defeat me, ten demons wouldn't be enough
I sleep in the lion's den, without the steel iron
Ascended like Musa coming down from Mt. Zion
Superlogical this, superlogical that
Digital, take it back with superlogical rap
Have a shootout, at midnight, the sequel's quicker
Forty four colt jolt, all you seen was the flicker
You distress like the damsel, lost like little 'Hansel'
Your flame couldn't generate the heat of a candle
Me, I be a Killa Bee, keeping exilery
Ol' play the desert e, shoot ten millime'
Master the millipede, you try to end the sea
Your body being found in the naval yard artillery
A black blind governor, a rich white mayor
Man, this whole city ain't got a prayer
Bobby has invaded, now the whole town's slated
Your decapitated head is being tooken' out paraded
Up and down the avenue, I drive a shatterproof
Benz, and all my men's are tattle proof
My mic is a dyke, my life is a light
A Day to God is a Thousand Years, how long is a night?
You get trapped in my shadow of dark, hark, who goes there?
Power-U smells like carp, don't put your nose there
Drop you to a tank of sharks, your wound's bleeding
And it's been two weeks since they had their last feeding
Any leftover bones, we grind into sand
And spread it out, over 20 acres of land
Some call me Steels, cause it's hard to bend me
See Cipher Pigs can't apprehend me
In a no smoking zone, I smoke bones of hash
Niggas see me, then I disappear in the flash
Next time I'm spotted, I got the fatter wallet
Moving with a clique that stick like dry porridge
Someone's been sitting in my chair, who goes there?
To sub zero cold, your words can't flow here
Glaciers of ice, plus layers of spice
Say your prayers at night, 'fore you touch that mic




Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone


We don't hunt deer
Vegetarian dishes from the concierge
Presidential suites, presidential treats
Brazilian models, oilin' up my feet
10 days a month, my girl pays for lunch
3 days a week, we work out at Crunch
Time after time, line after line
Our stock increases, rhyme after rhyme
In the valley, of San Fernando
Found Q-Tip's wallet in El Segundo
Prolly been spotted on Telemundo
With more wild cards than a box of Uno
That spin like propeller, my dog like Old Yeller
Holler at the moon, my goons at Coachella


Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone


I got my hands in the pot, 500 grand in the yacht
I'm the dope man with plans to expand on every block
Wu-brand, legendary hands, hard as penitentiary rock
Now put that to your temple, the Wu symbol's 'bout to drop
Insert the beam on my Glock, got that lean in my bottle
What that mean? High self esteem, straight cream on the top
Ridin' chops similar to UFC kickbox, kick rocks
Dirty trucker pit stops, shit, grams in a Ziploc
Watch how the pitbull lock his jaws, then lock your doors
Feds watch the boards, hip hop spills out my pores
I be raw, for fourscore plus 7 more
The Clan rock the tours, we be them reservoir dogs


Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier


Guaranteed I bang hard
I plan to leave the game large, no brainwash
The devil himself could not persuade God, my blade's sharp
Circle my square, I dare you Braveheart
Before I leave your head in your hands, what's your name, huh?
My lines get in your cells like 7 Ls
Any problem, I address you like I'm sendin' you mail
Let me do well, they'd rather see me dead or in jail
But let it be my life story if they ever do tell
Know I died for what I live
An intimate connection for that infinite reflection
That's my wife and my kids, there's a price on my lid
So now my stock's high and shots fired
My niggas who was tight with the kid
I'm hot as Hell's Kitchen with the oven on
Deck bomb, teflon the rappers nothin' to a don
If I'm frontin' then respond
If not, throw up your arms, it's the Killer Bee swarm
And your set, the fuck is y'all?


You entering the 36, mastering the 18
Sliding across chamber sixth, hands down that'll crush bricks
Backs thatll break bats, this is what y'all wanted back
Classic Wu RZA track with Mathematic actual facts
That weigh heavy, the universal striking attack
Dance the drunken medley, long axe blade, machete
The shadow stepping ninja


Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier




You leave me on fire when
You lead me like a siren
You leave me on fire when
You lead me like a siren


If only you could see everything from my point of view
You would understand the truth of things you would not misconstrue
Baby, let me into your heart, I want every part of you
Down to the itty bitty molecules for particles
If you just give me a chance
I'll show the god in you
We could go back to the garden and do what lovers do


I want everything
This world can give
A nice car to drive
A nice home to live
Money in my pocket
Love in my bed
It's my daily bread


You leave me on fire when
You lead me like a siren
You leave me on fire when
You lead me like a siren


If only you could see everything from my point of view
You would understand the truth of this and you would not misconstrue
Baby let me into your heart, I want every part of you
If you just give me a chance, Ill show you god in you
And we could go back to the garden and do what lovers do


You know I party like a rockstar
And you can catch me eating guppy at the shark bar
I see you Irif what up Allah U Akbar
8 million stories in the backseat of a cop car
But I dont need to go to jail I already got bar
Cut the coke with the baking soda I rock hard
For no charge or debit we call em flash cards
We flashin money in here, call that a flash mob


Check the dark star status, see the rhinestone jacket afar
Meth, R and P, my guitar string bleed
Rhyme superstar on the weed
RZA-Ra striking the keys, it's like heaven sent


I want everything
This world can give
A nice car to drive
A nice home to live
Money in my pocket
Love in my bed
It's my daily bread
Yo I want everything
That this world can give
A nice car to drive
A nice home to live
Money in my pocket
And love inside my bed
And I praise the lord for my daily bread
We rise and roll rock and roll
Trying to find a pot of gold
To free from the strife of todays economy
Trying to find a pot of gold
Trying to find a pot of gold




The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man


Yo, pa, I got a lady, I'm 'bout to make her my baby
Might even make a baby, the thesis makin' her crazy
She know my style wavy, I'm circlin' her Mercedes
Father, father was a preacher, I'm almost certain he hates me
But he ain't gotta date me and look, his baby is grown
And she decides on her own who resides on the throne
I'm her king, she my queen, we keep it right in the zone
And she understands the fact that I'm even right when I'm wrong
When she was prayin' in church, I was playin' in dirt
That's 100, I admit that we both was playin' at first
When opposites attract, I ain't always sayin' it works
I'm just sayin' ain't no use in me strayin', that make it worse
It's Wu-Tang, baby, my crew bang
And she's the preacher's daughter, I just call her my boo thang
And we tighter than shoestrings, or 10 grand in rubber bands
Man, sometimes I tell your parents just don't understand


No. yo, you mean Pastor Brown's daughter?
The preacher, the rich slave-maker of the poorer?
I used to see her Sundays comin' from church
We used to kick it at her window when her pops at work
Yo, her parents didn't play
She couldn't even come out to play on a school day
Thought she was gonna give me some on April Fool's day
(But no, no way) nah, (no, no-no, no-no, no-no way)


The preacher's daughter, she an illegitimate child
She know the word, but she be runnin' in them streets foul
She married to a man, but she's crushin' his brother now
See her in the market place loud and boisterous
With tight spandex on, chokin' her oysters
She a seductress in the form of a goddess
Never virtuous or modest, poison the part is
Breakin' the vessel, turn brother against brother
Man, that's how she molest you
That's why the preacher man prolly a mess too
Cause the fruit that she devourin' is evil
Never sin around righteous people
Black widow, preacher's daughter comin' to eat you


The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man


I met her on the bus stop with black eyes
That's why she said she don't fuck with black guys
I cleaned her up, fed her all my wisdom
Her father spit the gospel but she never caught the vision
Brutal ass whoopins, always facin' these evictions
So she only fuck with thugs that'll wind up in the system
Them greasy bastards quick to squeeze a ratchet
Never knew the science of virtue, Ecclesiastes
Like, a time for peace, a time for war
A time to laugh though, she never felt God before
Eternal love that'll pop like a kernel, this is grown folk talk
Between me and her, it don't concern you


The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man




There it goes
I was looking for it, there it is
There it goes
Alright, here we go
Here we go


Scandinavian bottles and Granddaddy Kush
Immaculate wardrobes, you had to look
Fox head furs from furlough, I'm double booked
Out of town with the subtle crooks
Double Dragon action
Fire breathing the interaction
Pure satisfaction of unknown passion
Bar crashing, tire slashing, and car scratching
My heart Alaskan
Love I was never asking
Biltmore grass, I double dip in the stash
Wine tastings, I bring my own glass
Potent hash, how long the zone last
Audi 6 chrome dash
Understatement, it's fast
Talk trash and make it rhyme with great design
Black Jedi with the force
Lightsaber shine
Breathe, slow down, take your time
No race, it's an acquired taste
You should savor mine
Be the change you want to see is my favorite line
When I'm quoting Gandhi to mami before we bump and grind
Last summer we summarized our subtle rise
Suckers tried to stunt got knucklized
New born's cry, the look of a mother's eye
That's how I feel about my art
I'm always surprised and astounded by the sounds when I'm around it
Founder's fountain of youth
Drum looping, we're about it


Say it loud, wack and you proud
Jump, scream, and shout it
Brother we don't allow
Say it loud, wack and you proud
Jump, scream, and shout it
Brother we don't allow


Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Word around town the whole city heard
Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Falcon flight nights
You can give me hers
Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Fly into the glass when your vision blur
Fly into the glass when your vision blur
Money stink mink, with the Kissyfur


Pretty bird flew right into my screen door
Glass look invisible
Look, peep how I'm rocking my Kangol like a HaLo
Wings of a angel, body so heavenly
I'm down to catch a felony
Especially when the melody is telling me
The recipe for flowing so steadily
Is witty unpredictably, my talent and natural game to bag a dame
Another track  and mane you make it sound fly
Silky, the flows is milky
Undisputed rhyme King of this mic ring
Dare a motherfucker to swing
Swords cling at the battle of the rapture
Fans that will kill you
Pretty bird scream for these microphone fiends
Legendary hip hop classic, we mastered
Burn like sulphuric for those who want to hear it


Say it loud, wack and you proud
Jump, scream, and shout it
Brother we don't allow
Say it loud, wack and you proud
Jump, scream, and shout it
Brother we don't allow


Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird (yeah)
Word around town the whole city heard
Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Falcon flight nights
You can give me hers
Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Fly into the glass when your vision blur
(yeah)
Fly into the glass when your vision blur
(yeah, what!)


I said "smile baby" She said "I haven't smiled lately"
"It's been a while, I got trials, I feel like God hate me"
I told her "count your blessings, not your problems"
Forget all our differences, what do we have in common?
Disparities, and our similarities, cause casualties
All in her heart cavity, battling like the Maccabees
The way a mack would be
Attacking all her faculties
It's deep, I'm like Philippe's them other cats is Applebee's
She make them bow down like the Japanese
Stealing hearts like a villain notorious
So dastardly, so nefarious
My boy's dapping me, it's hilarious
Shorty on fire, like a chariot
I guess a gritty verse it meant to be
The pretty bird may could return as the phoenix, eventually
I guess a gritty verse it meant to be
The pretty bird may could return as a phoenix, eventually


Say it loud, wack and you proud
Jump, scream, and shout it
Brother we don't allow
Say it loud, wack and you proud
Jump, scream, and shout it
Brother we don't allow


Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Word around town the whole city heard
Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Falcon flight nights
You can give me hers
Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Fly into the glass when your vision blur
Fly into the glass when your vision blur
Money stink mink, with the Kissyfur




Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to welcome to you
All the way from the slums of Shaolin
Special uninvited guests
Came in through the back door
Ladies and gentlemen, it's them!


Dance with the mantis, note the slim chances
Chant this anthem, swing like Pete Sampras
Taking it straight to Big Man On Campus
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Scandalous, made the metro panic
Cause static with or without the automatic
And while I'm at it, yo, you got cash, pass it
It's drastic, gotta send half to Dirty Bastard


Waves is spinning, blades is spinning
Slay em in the eighth inning
Stay truck, god stay playing linen
Kill rap, observe the uptowns, ho, feel that
Mink jeans on, seen where the real at
2000 Zitos, moving with a ill ego
For real, for real, ill lines, ill people
Yo, bring it back, 9 more civilians
Pollying deals, monopoly and bills, y'all niggas lying
Caught 300, lab look royal wit a mean stomach
Go broke, all seen, done it
Words from the heavy set, if I don't eat, then we already met
Fly ass bro, liver than coke


Now what Clan you know with lines this ill?
Bust shots at Big Ben like we got time to kill
Niggas can't gel or I'm just too high to tell
Put on my gasoline boots and walk through Hell
With 9 generals, 9 ninjas in your video
9 milli blow, semi-auto with no serial
Man metaphysical, I speak for criminals
Who don't pay they bills on time and fuck with digital
Never seen, smoke a bag of evergreen
My sword got a Jones, more heads for the severing
Johnny in the dungeon, taking all bets, throw ya ones in
Scared money don't make money, throw ya guns in


That's word to Damo, San Juan, Puerto Rico
Blowin hydro on a beach wit Tamiko
My gun bullet hollow for you to swallow
Blowin' the nozzle, hear it whistle
One in the head, this is code red, man for dead
X amount of lead spray from the barrel
Heat clear the street like Connor O'Carroll
Fully equipped, rifles, banana clip shit
To make my niggas from East New York flip


Yo, you may catch me in a pair of Polo Skipperys, matching cap
Razor blades in my gums (BOBBY!)
You may catch me in yellow Havana Joe's goose jumper
And my phaser off stun (BOBBY!)
Y'all might just catch me in the park playin' chess, studyin' math
Signin 7 and a sun (BOBBY!)
But you won't catch me without the ratchet, in the joint
Smoked out, dead broke or off point (BOBBY!)


Wallo's comfortable, chocolate frosting
Your socks hangin' out, yours is talkin'
Rock so steadily, son, I'm still crazy
Sport my old Force MD furs from the 80's
Nat Turners wit burners, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Taught y'all niggas how to rap, reimburse me
Rothsdale's, ruby red sales, Bloomingdale's, blocks
Ox tails chopped up in Caribbean spots
I'm nice, maxed out, creepin' wit the ax out
Murder these bikini bitches, switchin with they backs out


Niggas wanna pop shit, I pop clips
Bitch, I'll put my dick on ya lips
Alabama split, hammer slay quick
That David Banner gamma ray shit
Shells in the mouth, jailhouse snitch
My powder voice, Snow White sniff
Verbal killas, gorilla grip
God body shit, puff Marley spliffs


You might see me in a 6, that's not my style
You might see me wit a bitch, that's not my child
I be in the benzo, keep a low profile
Dead serious, take flicks and don't smile
Tryin' to get money, y'all cats is wild
I pose for the clothes, make a song like wild
I'm a chip off the board game, got sword game
Live life to the fullest, still want more fame
Darts on layaway, beats on standby
Outfits pressed up, ready for airtime


Run on the track like Jesse Owens
Broke the record flowin', without any knowin'
That my wordplay run the 400 meter relay
It's on once I grab the baton from the DJ
A athlete wit his iron cleat in the ground
Wireless nigga who sprint off the gun sound
The best time yet still 7.0
Swift flow made the cameramen clothes blow




Walk in the club, doin it big
Everything she do shit, on some bullshit
Champagne on er body, on some new shit
Imma exclude her and include her
Pussy wet on the set, nigga pussy purr
On some jah rastafari ru girl
Pink pussy, pink panties, pink nouveu

Make her kitty cat, whistle back, yall know she got that
Red snapper, dog catcher, sun I had to ask er
Will you get that B sippin on me miss blondie?
When your friends call me, Palm sweet beach
After party, let us all see, your pussy smoke a Lucy
Creep, let yo body speak with the same heat
Knee deep, in between the sheets, do it to the beat
Come whistle at the hot chief, me and Gotti getting money
Poppin Don, smoking lovely, Gs up, hoes down
Wu Tang and Dog Pound coming through your town

Uh... sweetness.. beautiful queen
Beautiful queen... beautiful queen, yeah

Add a little sugar, honeysuckle and
A great big expression of happiness
Boy, you couldn't miss..
With a dozen roses, such will astound you


Her refinement was beautiful, I acknowledged her attraction
In passing, driven by a desire to know if she's taken
I was askin', "Is your heart vacant?
Excuse me, Miss, how you feel? Can we build?"
Could it be the mind you see, guidin' you to me?
Extendin' my hand to welcome you in paradise
Supreme observation, di-tect hesitation
Your mind flashed back to other shit you've been through
Others left you questionable, what's acceptable?
The first sight of this divine light might shy you
Warm words melt the ice between us
My thoughts penetrate and begin to break through


Let's hit Vegas while the weather is nice
Kiss my hand before I roll my dice
In the 7-45, L.I., rollin' up to your doorstep
It's just the simple thtings in life we do


Watch the God as I'm shapin' and moldin' this planet I'm holdin'
In suspended animation, love is the highest elevation
Of understandin' I can show, over this candle-light scene
This is King toast Queen
We touch glasses, sippin' the finest imports
Frankinmyrrh and Love Supreme, raspberry bubble bath cream
Steam the mirror, I draw hearts with our name
Relaxin' ya brain with sweet sounds from Claudine
Gladys Knight on to Curtis Mayfield thing
It's just nice-ness, the absence of confusion
Love, peace and happiness, pure bliss
Reminisce about the evenin', hit me when you reach home
Maybe we can build and add on over the phone
Sugar I smoke bone, do you think that I'm wrong?
Your moms might disapprove of my smooth rudeness
Excuse, I don't mean to intrude




Aight, yeah love
See you treatment is royal, relax and uncoil
You spoiled with petals on ya bath water, love
I rose in my whip with my wiz in thought
It rained lightly on the window, the wipe was flowin' simu'
To the melody, "Didn't I blow you mind?"
Hit the spliff slow, sit low, seat reclined
In due time, every square inch will be mine
She so fine, reflectin' the light I shine, over wine
I knew she had the good nook-nook from the first look
Hair well groomed and thing
Body wrapped with the Fendi sandle to match
Coach back, swingin' on arm, approach the calm
Skin buttermilk soft as Persian lamb cloth
She asked for directions as if she was lost
But fully in tune with the stars, Sun and Moon
In the tomb, when Starks hit the milk of Lorna Doon




Didn't I blow your mind?
Oh, didn't I blow your mind?
Oh, didn't I blow your mind?
Didn't I blow your mind?

Hit the spliffs slow, sit low, seat reclined
In due time, every square inch will be mines
She so fine, reflectin' the light I shine, over wine
I knew she had the good nook-nook from the first look
Hair well groomed and thing
Body wrapped with the Fendi sandle to match
Coach back, swingin' on arm, approach the calm
Skin buttermilk soft as Persian lamb cloth
She asked for directions as if she was lost
But fully in tune with the stars, Sun and Moon
In the tomb, when Starks hit the milk of Lorna Doon



Didn't I blow your mind?
Oh, didn't I blow your mind?
Oh, didn't I blow your mind?
Didn't I blow your mind?


Beautiful queens, beautiful queens
Beautiful queens, beautiful queens




You will be punished (Wu-Tang style)
For all your evil deeds (Wu-Tang style)
Be warned - you will suffer (Wu-Tang style)
Justice (Wu-Tang style)


Slept on this hazardous enterprise
Hit from the back, from a long range attack in disguise
Week self-captivity became months
Those who were holdin' it down they hold a pump
Do we delay the conflict and prolong the suffer?
Got a mass of starvin' niggas wanna eat supper
Unfair corruptions lead to abductions
Creatin' wider circles of destructions
So we attack, with the pen and blaze in
From the terrifyin' to the fascinating
Quick to slay a narrow minded nigga that's hasty to give credit
Full of hostile overtones mixed with wack edits
They heavily defended airfields
But they bodies rot behind punctured steels
When I greeted you, you didn't hear a piece of my voice?
Oh that water was my liquid of choice
Forensic couldn't tell it, it was nine tons of steel pellet
Powerful projection, noise is deafening
Carrier battle groups, that's threatening
Higher level bombing, plus
The shipment in hand known as alarming, bells ring loud
In the same crucial manner but different style


Wu-Tang style
Wu-Tang style


Ayo once again, all blunts again
Yo the real remain silent, any type of violence I'm in
Allah's helpful most, innovative raps
That brought wealth through, shot out the belch too
We holdin', automatic semis with sick lines
Run up, body niggas, break down shoddy niggas
Styles so sharp, state of the art
Greater the mark, flyest creator sprayed layin' darts
Flowin' like water, "Apocalypse Now"
Gun out blaow, wow the shit's wild when you short us
Runnin' through parkin' lots, don't get caught
Let off, bark your shots, we outta here, off the blocks


It ain't all to the good, muh'fuckers hatin' in the hood
Gotta a hundred wolves waitin' in the woods
For the Clan's forthcomin'
I miss you in the game a court summons
And fugitives of rap caught runnin, y'all get locked up
E'rything was wack 'til we popped up
And got it on and poppin' like Orville Reddenbacher
Potnah, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
Wu-Tang got ya, like every ghetto got a Tasha
Request lines are now open, you see these MC's chokin'
And thinkin', "What's that SHIT they be smokin'?"
I'm so focused, simple chronic halitosis
Keep my shit funky when I spit this braggadocious
 Y'all niggas got some fuckin nerve
To critic what I write, that's my muh'fuckin word
Blah blah blah, like N'Sync
Kiss that ass bye bye bye knahmsayin'? I ain't playin'


Many shall come, few chose to stay exact
Track after track I'm fightin' for survival
Before me I see hills and mountains they sway
The words gotta move and the crowd's like the ocean
I walk water holdin' y'all suspended with the vocal
What's the total people that came to see the Gods?
I gave thought talent, construct my best poetry
Potentcy, high-level content
Side effect may cause a tec to eject, many places
All ages streets to cages, split faces
Shoutin' nuff love to the peeps from Miami
We live from Pulaski and spread glassy


Wu-Tang style




Yeah, yeah, y'all
This is the famous Popa Wu
You know how it go down baby
You understand? The Remarkable Timing by the 60 Second Assassin baby
We coming thru man live, just live baby
We doing our thang now, man
Coming straight from the mind, straight with the math
You understand?
We gon' put it in for y'all right now
You understand?
We gon' take it all thru the degree of knowledge man
And bring it back man to the foundation

(Hook) Jay-Z sample
"When I rhyme with Remarkable Timing"


One-two, now, one-two, now, listen
Meditation soul for strings, wisdom overflowing, mind blowing
60 Sec, Masta with the Bronze Naz classic Chamber Musik rapture
Before the laughter came tears love hella right
Black, brown, red, yellow, white
My mic bless nations with the perfect timing
Lyrics build the universal thought
Rhyming is the leads, my magnetic substance is speech
Attracted a-alike
Now ladies when you hear the God speak squeeze ya legs tight
This is Irief, you know what I bring
The murder word play, intensity danger
Chi-Town P-Stone Ranger
Teach the truth, Black!
United we can fight it, divided, well you know what that do
When crews separate hate, when family suffer, friends kill friends
Brothers gotta stand together
We can make it, take it to another level
Peace to Rebel INS

(Hook) Jay-Z sample
"When I rhyme with Remarkable Timing"


It's so remarkable, spark-able up the world and arsenal
Dutch, chuch, phenomenal, crush, rush the silent hill
The timing I'm in, has got me vibing on assignment
Where all the livest live men, silent upon my entrance
That too, formerly introduce heavy on revenue
Who generate only new cuz you never knew
The history, the chapters, the saga, the seconds after
I almost called it quits, and realized that I'm the ...
High exalted, yet falter, slaughtered the Almighty Titan
Keep fighting the good fight, and prosper in Remarkable Timing

(Hook) Jay-Z sample
"When I rhyme with Remarkable Timing"


60 Sec, for creating the impossible
Remarkable Timing, concoctional
Bullshit can step into my arch of flow
Non-un-lockable, my hourglass still tick-tock-able
Like some of y'all birds I know they stay flock-able
Coo-coo cuz I still lock in the sock, you know
Made contracts but fuck everything optional
Fuck an infrared I got you cross-line telescopical
You know you here today but gon' tomorrow
You know like years took hip-hop ago
Nothing right now is really marketable
All talk is philosophical
60 Sec they scared to death, I'm unstoppable
How you gon' stop every Sec can stop a flow
My mission impossible, I'm hard to kill
Somebody guard his grill and let him know that God is real
Time be the master of illusion
Cause the level of our mind stay grooving
Never be no time to be losing
Only once in the time shall be proving
Time be the master of illusion
Cause the level of our mind stay grooving
Never be no time to be losing
Only once in the time shall be proving

(Hook) Jay-Z sample
"When I rhyme with Remarkable Timing"


Popa Wu baby
Remarkable Timing, 60 Second Assassin
Straight from the mind
We gon' put it in for y'all right now
You understand?
We gon' take it all thru the degree of knowledge man
And bring it back man to the foundation
You understand?
We gon' make it rain on y'all this time
You understand?
And y'all gon' wonder who caused it to happen
Give you 60 minutes of your time baby
And what you gon' get the Remarkable Time baby
You understand?
Yeah, 60 Second Assassin y'all




Damn back again, up on track again
Some of y'all black again it got dark
On your mark get set
Out of sight out of mind
Hyprocites forget like marionettes
Strings in the back like nets
The chosen one who can laugh themselves to death
Lack of rhymes, meaningless punch lines
Battle for your mind, like Israel and Palestine
Good news there is some hard ass times
No more disses, repeated hook lines and chorus'
Days of doris'
Got issues and wishes
Got the jam but gettin paid up off the misses
Ain't nothin wrong but wait fuck another love song
It's the R&B strangler bringing noise in the Wranglers
Rock all the heads big times and alzheimers
Shot the pill while I drop skills up in Brazil
Now the pitch
Lord save us from that sword of Davis
That kidnap hip-hop tracks and the beats in the game of rap
Put my soul in it
Care less about the gold in it
Boom the shootie
Got 'em running from the paparazzi
La di da di, when the feds come and doom your party
Cracker in the back, don't you know it's illuminati
Ain't nothing changed, P.E. we be the same crew
Resurrection in the game here to save you


Yo it's going down baby, it's going down family
That's my word
We gettin ready to turn this shit to the two and three zeros
Ya know what I'm sayin
Have all the clocks goin backwards
Have everything goin haywire
You lauged before let's see you laugh now blue cow
How now black cow
Word to bird, word to bird, word to bird, nigga


One on one, hard like tarot cards
Behold, the one man million man march
Takes a nation, 400 year violation
Apocalyptic no power in this happy hour
Hazardous, no you don't like lazarus
Just black baby
Where my soul be at
Star spelled backwards is rats
Let bra man rap
I'm trapped in the back with these industry cats
One step forward two steps back
Making habits claiming habitats
Ratta tat tat
Wish you could turn back the hands of time
And get mental
Pop the track eight track Lincoln Continental
I'm the mouth that roared, swore to the Lord
The eye of hawk, both live and die by the sword
The forbidden
The six man be sinning from the beginning
The suckers hand be hidden
Intense
Knocking your block with some sense
P.E. got more jewels than dead presidents
The devil try to get me cross like a crucifix
But I am focused on the vultures like a loc of locusts
New world order is goin' down
Gettin round, I'm the spook that sat by the sound
Fucking with Saddam will bring a new Saigon
Ain't nothing changed, P.E. we be the same crew (boy)


Yeah that's right, 9-8, no joking
We coming out smoking
And for all y'all that's been sleeping on us
You're lacking you're lacking
Aiyyo, check 1-2
I've got my mand that's about to sneak up on you and your crew
Ya know what I'm saying
Check 1-2
Aiyo Masta Killa I want you to put one up in 'em son
And show 'em you ain't done son
Ball 'em with the back of the gun son, make 'em run son


Sliding down Broadway beneath the J line
Slumped in the incline position
Mind travellin beyond the shell
Which holds the soul controlled by the Allah
I be most humble but also punishable
For those who are unlawful to righteousness
I strive to stay alive and live this
Many fell victim to the wisdom
I mastered this
The track ovulates the mic like prostate gland imperegnates
Onto the paper the pain pours
For the love of my brother that hurts just the same
Fuck fame
My gun I bust to maintain
Moods are insiduous
Baffels and eludes those who label the God being anti-social
Chose not to apply their third eye
I travel at the speed of thought rate
It's fatal
What will enable a man to levitate


And you can take that and put that on the back of your brain
Coming straight to you from Masta Killa
Ain't nothin' iller
I told you PE is still in full effect beyond the year 2000
We ain't taking no shorts and y'all need to know that to make your head fat, boy




You asked me to secure a place for you in history
History is watching, waiting for a decision
This is your moment


Ayo, revenge is sweet, that's why I take my time with it
Like good pussy I just stay when I'm up in it
Evil plan, my mind functions well off spite
I don't do that tit for tat, I blow your shit up like dynamite
Take my life, I'll take every one you love
Have your kids thrown out of a plane, Look out cuz
My plots are like movie scripts, they well planned
Snatch you off the land and drop you off in the Sahara sand
So don't scam, don't try to double cross me
My Tennessee goons'll nail that ass to the cross, B
Revenge mode, I live life by the sword
And if you live by it, die by it, I'll still kill your horse
Set me up, coming back, like a thief in the night
I'll have a suicide bomber pop up on your flight
You couldn't take my life, my mask done resurrected
And I'm Ghostface Killah, way more than you expected


Those involved with this tale cursed the day they ever heard the name Tony Starks, and wreaked the day they heard the music was played from the records which comprised of his flesh


Yes, but what they didn't expect
A hundred ghouls from the projects
Armed and masked with flamethrowers and gas'll blast anything
Hung him by his tongue ring, till he gave the info on how we find his kinfolk
Made him sign the ransom, then gave the note to his grandson
Bust the shot and made him run fast back to his family
News of his discovery would set off a chain of events
That would then lead to members of DeLucas to bleed with no exception
They sent the wrong message so kill everything, no exception to the media
There would not be a retire or cease fire till every Luca has expired, in entirety
Wishes of the god, Tone Starks to eternity, respectfully


Cutthroats, murder sprees, and killings were synonymous with his gangsta life before his passing. So it'd only seem fitting that it would become the embodiment of his new life


I keep having flashbacks of blasting at you bastards, cutting outside the benches
Got convicted of the gun charge and laughed at my sentence
Four years, five flat post-release supervision
For niggas spitting in the wind, but that's what I get for missing
So soon as I hit the bridge again, niggas is finished
Ninja mode on a mission out to end your existence
Think I'm sitting up in prison with a tin of L, in a cell, sick ass hell, listen
Everyday is like Christmas, I miss my seed and my missus, but I see em on visits
I ain't stressing over pussy, beat my dick to her pictures
When they free me I'mma see you, leave you food for the fishes
Hope the Luca crew is in for the fixing, now get the henchman
Line em up, Tommy gun em down, the muzzle extension
Tear they flesh off if one of em flinching




You take on face value how fast the light travel
It's heaven sent gift from the Universe
Blessings, tired of Offerings
There's no compromisin' the truth

Exposin' the Germ, take Worm
Poison animal eaters you must learn
Let me teach you how to see through six
Risin' above the mist, the naked eye can hardly detect

'What then is Justice, that we may do Justice?'
'The face of a killer is your face, my face, our face'


This first MC Law he swore to make the crowd raw
Came up through the floor drew his Mic from his hip and began
To squeeze Clip, son said 'Don't kill 'em as quick'
Let 'em do tray, palm stay 18 Jay
Who made it possible for you to witness?
First born built the weather to storm
Bees swarm like hundred witness scorn
This is warnin' to the people we ship the sour
Diesel through the Caroline distribution
Pipe line spark it equal
Guarded people as divine makes it's final descent
To the Pavement, we laced it, keepin' it basic
Who is this Ivory Jamel Ring Bells through out the city?
A few know him well this description Black Male
Wit the Universe who flag drippin' off as the Bell

Huh, after all these years, what you said was true
The Shaolin and the Wu-Tang is very dangerous

Hahahahahah


It's the ODB kid, once again coming through your area
And I'm going to tell you one time, you gon' love this


I had to get the money, said it wasn't a choice
Die Hard's on the bars, Ladies lovin' the voice
Morphine flow, numbing your joints
Bomb a nigga like he number 81 from Detroit
Zombie life, World War Z
Antidote to your virus, your highness, the world on me
Capital G, cool as the dude from Dos Equis
So deadly, I don't make it rain, I snow heavy
Sick lane, Nic Cage how I ride with fire
Forever with bars, sort of like a lifer
With the son of anarchy, I be breaking bad
Walking dead, day dreaming of making a band
Dancing with the stars, Americans idol me
The mentalist with the Big Bang Theory


Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


The most duplicated, anticipated, validated
Urban legends in the books with the ones who made it
Highly celebrated, everything was work related
Current top 40 got the Wu deep in all their business
20 years Killa Bees, yeah, we hold the pennant
Monumental stance on the cover with my co-defendants
Drop her sentence, in remembrance
Construct these jewels so they can live through my descendants


Youngun, I can see your draws, pull your pants up
Can't even call yourself a man until you man up
And if you call yourself a fan you need to stand up
This ain't a party, it's a jux, keep your hands up
And I don't care who runs the city when the summer come
Your summer's done, Wu forever, and we're still number one


Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


Picture a nigga on the strip getting rich off the drug shit
Putting other niggas on, teaching em thug shit
Then they want stick 'em up, then they get slugs quick
Hood-type niggas always living that crime life
Jealous-ass grimy niggas seeing the limelight
Slimy old nigga like fucking your mans wife
Fool shouldn't use the word brother, he man dyke


Yo, I spin my web all across New York
Get it out in all types of ice, there's a sport
One chain, two chain, three chain, four
Niggas mouth's drop like the leaves in the fall
Tone got that WBC
I take off heavy in air balloons and land in the Fiji's
That's my bird and that's my word
You faggots keep fucking around and get curbed
(I came to town)


Forms circles like the rings of Saturn
Dust rocks and ice in a particular pattern
Then this fascinating picture has emerged from surface
A wonder of the young world with an urgent purpose
A wild fire engulfing every home
It's history chiseled and carved in every stone
A workshop where skills are learned
Handcrafted and drafted, written works the main concern
Urban center provided with a social structure
And a curious culture full of superconductors
Each stain is part of a scene with
Intricate geometric raps on a larger screen
Spell bounding, marvelous and it's surrounding
Viewpoints remain the same, it's all astounding
A place where the forgotten art is so powerful
A striking image is something that's so valuable


This one's the blackout! Three-fifty-seven to your mouth!


GZA, this is called Ruckus In B Minor
Rae, all those bad times is behind us
Ghost, put that mask on to remind us
Method Man, let 'em know who's New York's finest

Can't even call yourself a man until you man up
And if you call yourself a fan you need to stand up

Your summer's done, Wu forever, and we're still number one

Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


Now I'mma let all you motherfuckers know
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga
I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker!


My lines is like Peruvian coke, go ahead and try one
My recipe is A1 remarkable with my mixture
Rainman mathematician, this city slicker
The finest threads cover my frame, the cloths of royalty
Strive with an army of winners and no pretenders
(*One*) We live free and achieve more
But first we gotta win with no stalemate
The all eye seeing is victorious biz to the sound man


Armored trucks, tanks are bulletproof, been the truth
Loot the track, clear the booth, my thought ready, aim, shoot
My knowledge one twenty proof, let's tear the roof off
Let's spray, M-A-S-T-A
King I Love-Love club, pack stadium rock
I hold the mic snug, split a slug
Black ninja, mask and gloves


Still number one, still number one

Uh
Imma f'kin like this, ha, ha, ha...
You already know
Peace to my brother Ghostface


Party people, welcome to the gathering
Many of you tonight have traveled for many miles
To hear the master of the art display styles and techniques
Now with this piece of steel that I hold so firmly
I conduct yall accordingly, one time for your mind
Authentically designed and crafted by the hand of god
Autograph, camera phones, flash as I enter
A glimpse of the ninja, rarely seen and heard
But his words so powerful, catch him at the show and prove
Building with Allah's son, who they talking bout, me?


Who they talking bout, who they talking bout, ahhh?
Who y'all talkin bout? Ah?
Who they talking bout, me?
Who they talking bout, you keep my mic in ya mouth


With beats so banging and, bass drum kicking and
Melody soulful strings are calling, it's like
Back against electrical fence, but Im a winner
My mic's like my only defense, brothers locked down
Aunties that changed my pampers, all sponsors
I wont fail the mission, with self knowledge guiding me
Nothing can contain me from seeing everything that's mine
Economically, nothing is given
We know steps are taken, people couldn't see it until it burst to existence
Brush the stardust from the sleeves of my jacket


Who they talking bout, who they talking bout
Who y'all talkin bout, who you talking bout?
Who they talking bout, me?
Who they talking bout, you keep my mic in ya mouth


See, this is how your rhyme gotta be young G
Im a writer not a rapper, emcee
Build-or-destroyer, some overstand, but I understand that
We are students to life, true divine order
Must be restored in order for us to live right
Yall stay chirping like birds, words travel
At the speed that Im slappin you
Ask you as the world revolves, caliente
Its about 100 degrees with no breeze, can you swim nine thousand?
I bench press hills and mountains from the highest peak
I fears no evil as I walk through the valley
Im like the father at the first rally, are you listening?




Yo, yo, yo, what up kid? Yo, these niggas is back, son
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) I'm telling you, spit that, done it nigga
Yeah... yeah... yeah, yeah, I seen it like a Zenith, man
You hear me man? Word up, man, ya'll know what it is
It's on again, man, for real, Top Gun, what what


Aiyo, we came through thumping like elephants
The new Range is super-charged, I remains intelligent
Back to the formula, lord, hard grammar
This is God school, make sure the lobby ain't jammed up
Excalibur swords, T-Rexes, bibles of rhymes
We in the lunchroom, weed and veggies for breakfast
Polo campus, sicker lances, the crisp
Hundred dollar kick niggas, that be showing you hand steps
Back to the dormatory, where niggas
Broke my forearm and index finger, now you write glory
True holding my flag, it's all engraved in my blade
So when I wave it, you gon' say Rae mad
Now it's 28 Days Later, now Wu's up, do something, you can't
It's blood in my eye, I might get amped
To rip something down, the billboard holders is back
So when you see me, you gon' say he gets down


From darkness to DNA, I move with my brother
And we resonate, energy that shifts in colors
Bringing MC's punishment, then I'm done with it
The meter leave way on the fast break, I run with it
It was not a hobby, but a childhood passion
That had started in the lobby and was quicky fashioned
Every line to line, bar for bar is clockwork
Hazardous and powerful enough to have your block hurt
Check the total amount of MC's inflicted
With torture, from moving with work that's restricted
We criticize producers til they joints are right
Then acupuncture the track with pinpoints of light
Hitting them from well conceiled firing positions
With explosiveness that'll make the deaf listen
Drastic, pyroclastic, connected with the same old
Down the dangerous slopes of an active volcano


Blitz like the Green Bay Packers, sack like the linebackers
Hang with niggas, like redneck crackers
Strangle cold bottles of Beck's, like a vexed German
Duck low behind the car, my tech burning
Neck burning, from eight karats of sunlight
Absorbed, in the grill, Big Pun like
Lord of the Wu-Tang sword, know what that means?
Like J.R. Tolkien, it's the Lord of the Rings
This is my man, Chef, auto, like Grand Theft Auto
The 18th letter, followed by the mark of Zorro
Plus A, not for apple, but I pack an apple
Shorty try to buck back, and knock me off the saddle
Caramel, pecan, sundae, Pregline
Plump breasts, was filled with saline
Her big booty cousin, nasty Nadine
Get you on the floor, whore tried to double team


Is he still that nucca? Is he in the hood like that?
Is he really strapped? Will he really split yo' shit?
I thought you said he rap? Pull up in the yard, ten sets
He ain't flexing, microphone ripping, heat holding
Who testing? Rope-a-dope his black lotus
Can't quote this, chat with the sword tongue
Duck when the axe is swinging, wild Apache drum
Crazy Horse kicking his thoughts, he won't quit
Can't tell 'em nothing, he grown, give the man room
Space was demanded, beat banging through the speaker
Voice, heat seek missle, guided at the listener
Swing to the gospel, catch up and wet at the brothel
Unstoppable, direction of my flow, optional
To the ear, depending on the current of air, the crowd's in




What are you doing home from school so early?
You shouldn't be back for another two hours
Now answer me... what are you doing home?
(I got suspended) Suspended? For what?
(Nothing) A good student like you, don't get suspended for nothing
Now why were you sent home? (Cuz I'm black!)


Bangin' on the lunchroom table, I used to spectate
And watch some of the M.C. greats
Throw verses back and forth, I didn't have the heart to step forth
I used to take it home to write some of my own
But still I wasn't ready to touch the mic-phone
The back staircases of school was filled with blunt residue
A broken lightbulb and the crew, a man or two
Bangin' on the wall while a few M.C.'s, shoot the breeze
I'm just passin' through, I might've took two off the trees
We fiend for this hip hop quarantine
Listen out for the walkie talkies of the Dean (security coming...)
*beat switch*


Bododo.. school!
Sat in the back of the class with my hand up
Two wild security guards, grabbed my man up
Threw him in detention for 5 days suspension
Cause he said, the teacher was lyin about the Indians
Tryin to dumb us with the story of Columbus
And brain-numb us, when all you see, that came from us
They copy-carvin, I learned about God and
Taggin Wu logo on the book margin
Intense like a New York riot, she stood quiet
And asked me, could she speak to me in private
(Mr. Diggs, you actin' like a fool...) Huh?
(You know these rules that we have in these schools) Yeah..
(You and your friends think y'all cool) Why?
(Cuz ya'll walk through these halls with the 12 jewels)
Fat shoe laces and tri-colored sneakers
I stood like a man then I questioned my teacher
Why don't we speak about the wisdom of the sages?
And how did Europe black out in the dark ages?
And when they got light did they white-wash the pages?
And the inquisition, why was Christian's thrown in cages?
And why would they try to destroy the nation?
With their birth control and bring control fluoridation?
And why it seems that half the school is racist?
She said "Diggs, to the office!" We about faces..


Headed my paper with the proper title
Who wrote the holy Koran or Bible?
Bein' that person with the scent ability
Makes me responsible for the uncivil
The next morning as I entered the building
A cypher goin' on and the Gods is building
My hot chocolate spillin', after 5th period
Let's cut out, go bag some chicks up at Tilden
Wonderful had the rental, "Nobody Beats the Biz"
Instrumental, attractin' a few
Nothin' really poppin', let's slide to Clara Barton
Bumped into a few good brothers from Morgas Martin
Mentioned Norman Thomas, had chicks
That'll hit flicks, and take you shopping, true indeed
I thought Sarah J. had the one that I need
Mary Burtrum, Julia Richmond, is it fashion?
Eli Whitney sing the song with me
Sisters from Washington Irv. swing a arm
Brothers in death, pull the fire alarm
Rude ones flow rapness, Western House money makers
Maxwell thunder hip shakers..


They not on my level, but I can sit with the O.G.'s from there
And make it major, youknowhatimean? (That's what's nigga)
Right, but, we not doing that until we get this business settled
And even while we doing that, we try'nna get the Wu-Tang niggas
Cuz I love them niggas, I feel as though
They represent the east coast, how we represent the west coast
And I love them... *echoes*




Uh... musical clever
You know what time it is (Ooh-ahh, Meth Tical)
Yeah... what... (Hey, did you turn my mic down
Oh.. my headphone fell off.. damn..)


Death come to those who oppose
Knockin' at the door, holding a rose
In plain clothes, when the face ice cold
Lock your windows, still I come in when the wind blows
Come in slow, suddenly your eyes close
Then your body set through your soul, it rose
Turn into a black crow and fly into the internal night
That's when I also take flight
I turn into a great falcon
With mighty wings, when they flap, they move mountains
I leap on your back, like a wild fucking monkey
Eyes are blood shot red, with a growling tummy
Beat your fucking back out, like a gorilla
When I was tore, I figure my way, out the house of mirrors
I show up to a recording session, with no facial expression
I'm just there like I crept in
Escape through the east gate, return through the west ends
When the son said, I'm like the westerns beneath the moon light
And the crescent, Priest, I have a stance, that's strong
When I perform, I transform, into a sandstorm
Leaving one third of the land torn
I'm like mice, I react strange
I'm like a terratrane, I react crazy when the weather change
Then the father of a hurricane, handcuff pain
I whip tornados with iron chains
I make volcanos scream out my name
Niggas kill me, try'nna escape my wrath
Through death, don't you know, I'm crazy muthafucka, I hold my breath..


Flicks... sluggy... one time
For your muthafuckin' mind
Wu-Tang Forever, this is just the next chamber, baby
(Fish filet, fish filet) Ah, ah-ah-ah


We walking dogs, foot soldiers, fuck you all
Guns and roses, play the wall
The final curtain calls every day, all day
We hurtin' ya'll, project hallways is triflin'
Public Enemy, number one, still fightin'
The power, like Tyson
When nothing else work, start biting
Swallow up that weak shit, they writing
Spit it out, frustrated with the line
Hard for me to get it out
Intellectual, architect, bomb threat to a vegetable
Mr. Meth, you can get the left and right testicle
Step to the rear, Wu-Tang on arrival
Raised in the ghetto, singin' songs for survival
Nothing else matter, suspect chin niggas shatter
Clap a mad rapper, red dot beemin' on the blood clot, splatter
University, anniversary of terror
It's now, or it's never
Ain't no in betweens in the cold war
Can't hold it down, got a thousand that can hold yours
Starvin', pardon me, God, I get a charge
Like a human lighting rod, strike back with no regard
For the innocent, harder than the bricks in my tenements
Wu-Tang, forever and a day, we be killin' it


So patient, they sat there in the aisles and waited
For the testimony, hungry, for a statement from the one and only
Thirsty for the ceremony at and, true Wu die hard fans
Now look how we rock, make a freestyle drop, old school like the wop
My grandaddy used to do this dance called the slop
I keep it hip hop for ya'll, we don't stop
Got ladies by the flock, no safety on the Glock
Stop, look and listen when the semi auto's pop, your neck
Mock with the rope, who can match palm
I'm strong as a nuclear bomb, dangerous armed
Have you not prepared yourself, you've been warned
Gun shot to the informer, Killa Bee Swarm
Caught 'em on the corner of Lavonia
Reported missing, found him in the fetal position
Shot twice, armed with the rocket
Blind for the target, deaded on arrival
Suspenseful, kill or be killed, pass the rifle




I despise your killing and raping
You're despicable (Are you my judge?)
It's just you should be punished
I'm gonna chop off your arm, so are you ready?


Check these high hats sling tings moving through the rubbish
Party robust, rec room style for you brothers
Time's ticking, erupt misconduct
Entering one funk before the drum dry up
Dial, style, jab vocab slow
Alphabet run, construction voice might blow
Tap dance swelling Hemingway novel model
For a breather, dirty reefer hide your bottle
Cut down, come with something that's round and profound
Blood brothers, people of colors, we get down
Watch this fly, force feed things being said
Nine Diagram acid black evil red leathers
Mic half a dangle, serious a man
My mic clapper death wish, everlasting plan
Heavenly God body, know me as the cleaner
Night champion, old villain style seamer
Kiss a spider, Seagal saga why bother
Godfather talk drama, fly swatters


Number two, Chao San Poi


This Wu shit be hard to kill and full blown
Rhymes filtered through the net before words hit the chrome
Pro tools editing tracks that's rough
Cause a jam without a live MC isn't enough
So we attack this and grab all within reach
Throw a scrap back to niggas,perfect your own speech
Shit is copper, it ain't worth the mic stands
Used by backup singers in Atlantic City bands
Niggas look on and get hooked on this mic line
Reeled in and shipped through the pipeline
LPs delivered with style and potential
Niggas flowing smoothly in a sequential
Order, revealing hidden tape recorders
Stashed inside pockets of those who lack aura


Twist the DAC up, them niggas with math is back up
Watch he act up, fifty-two block track we slap up
Playground manoeuvre, jet to Vancouver like this
Two Kahluas one chick, she's German Luger
Get the shit on, light a fresh pack, bust it open
With the seal on Dunn, deal on this, with the real on
Necks rocky ring, call it the Decatur
Slang soufleer home decorater, player
Mic immigrants, nine of us formed resemblance
Somethin flashy, God dead-armed is nasty
Peep the ornaments enough to make Shorty-Wop stare at me yo
He killed the God might as well throw a chair at me


Yo MC's wonder what's Hip Hop thunder
Tell you the truth it's just one nation under a groove
Gettin down for the funk of it
Like Fred Sanford in the biz...
Yo inhale this paraphernalia, a Wu memorabilia
Melba the fortune teller, tried to tell ya
Bout the group recruit we scoop up CREAM like Breyer's
Then spread across the globe like telephone wires
Thirty-six assorted, Shaolin imported
Chambers been recorded, you're fuckin with the loops
Time for royalty audit
Fabulous establishment metabolism, Blackfoot Indian
Cherokee started out smaller than amphibian
Then grew to a physical body with five meridians
As the pendulum swings closer to the millenium
Two thousand, wickedness is spread amongst my citizen
I got a muscle the industrial to make a hustle
And politic with Lyor and Russell
When niggas is still rushin we'll brush you


He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives


Thoughts are contained in the trenches of the brain
Ignite, blowing the mic to Arabian heights
As I recite this medley, niggas couldn't fuck with the
Deadly ground I hold down
Classical gangland style, shots hit the ceiling
Panic and confusion echoes through the building
Continuing to build, I strive for perfection
Driven by the will to live, Glocks I hold
Shots I give, while searchers of rescue teams
Look for means of survival and who's liable
For this harrowing experience
You scream for the extreme, fiend for the cap
And proceeds of the Wu-Tang Academy
To fuck up your anatomy with assault and battery


Number two, Chao San Poi
Number two, Chao San Poi
He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives
Number one, Yen Chang Wa
He's an adulterer, don't trust him
Number two, Chao San Poi
Number two, Chao San Poi
He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives
I despise your killing, and raping
You're... despicable
Are you, my judge?
It's just... you should be punished
I'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?
I despise your killing, and raping
You're... despicable
Are you, my judge?
It's just... you should be punished
I'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?




I'm a - I'm a - I'm a shadow
I'm a - I'm a - I'm a shadow


I'm a shadow
Sucking light from the ground
Born from a window
Giving hope a taste of gloom


I'm a shadow
Following light in sorrow
My moment will be found
As I lay on the ground

Verse 3 - Masta Killa]
P Gordon
Yo Cruz we taking big money this year

Im on a private Island to record my album
Out of the shadow, gonna roll a platinum
Somewhere out in the West Indies
Laid back chilling under the palm
On private beaches, blowing trees
Pitch up in the shadow of a top model
Or be in a shadow, in the shadow
Like Carlo Gambino, over the shoulder of Frank Sinatra
All the mobsters in the shadows, getting money
Nah, we ain`t braggin'
We just stacking plenty of paper
Blowing the vapour
All in the maker, shadow lover
Mary Jane girl, shadow dancer
Im a Leo, she`s a Cancer
Rich dinero,  you can call me Theo
Wait that don`t sound like Killa flow
Motherfucker my flow is that cash flow
I need a hundred a show
That's what I came for
If ya`ll can`t afford me, ya`ll won`t see me
Only on TV, or out of the shadow
Sick apparel, double barrel
Flame and arrows
Have gun, will travel
When I speak you know it's heat
My shadow technique can never be beat
Don`t push on me as far as green that makes your head spin When you 


I'm a shadow
Following light in sorrow
My moment will be found
As I lay on the ground



  (x2)
Intruder alert, sound the cymbal
This be the war of the Shaolin Temple
It's time to re-stack my gun
We the ones that'll come through and smack sparks out your art
With the exception of a few that respected it for what it was
Sick venomous syndrome, studied many styles
But this tactic I've adapted and made it my own
Feelin' rightness at it at home, splittin' your head with the chrome
He's one who sees he's a threat
He couldn't have made it through, all the bad seeds and quarantines
We hit him with explosive gases, so he couldn't teach the masses
But still, who came in the name of Wu-Tang to nourish the brain?




One, two, one, two, the High Chief
Yeah... yo... so alone... baby


I'm just lookin' out of the window
Watchin' the gunshots blow-ow
Thinkin' how we all was turnin' out
Keepin' my head above water
Got to make a weight when I can (cuz I can)
Temporary lay off, cop pay offs, daily rip offs
Informer tip off, clips lick off
The judge got hit off, boss got knocked off
Worker made a come off, cash got dropped off
Buildings got burnt out, sisters got turned out
Work out in the yard up North, tryin' to burst out
Pissy elevators, dirty cop favors
Tongues hiding razors, minors turn majors
Wave the bigger tools, shoot out inside the school yard
The game ain't' changed, niggas done made their own rules
They buildin' plans, they pull a million dollar scam
Watch for taped conversations, Jakes and dollar bands
The black market, labelled the movin' target
Dwellin' in the heartless projects
Evil eyes walkin', the BBS rims flossin'
The beat walk in, harassin' the street walkin'
They keep talkin', like the Rebel might slow up
They set me up to go up, the witness din't show up


Look out in drug stores (but I'm slippin') bare approach the look out
Be off the block by ten, the kite was sent
Then all those who dare to oppose, were sent back
Chained to the train track, protect ya jaw
These silverback niggas eat their oatmeal raw
Cee Allah sawed the shotti, 'Preme went down for a body
He killed Poppy, dusted in the lobby, toxy off shocky
Cops be harassin' tryin' to stop cashin'
The episodes pass, I flash back to guns
And crack stashed in grass, you movin' savage
Please warn him of his ways and actions
Before I blast him
Then the homicide was justified when I arrive
Black tints on the glass with the stockin' cap mask
It's all official, steel pistol style whip you, to the gristle
While my team be stompin' you out after the whistle


I went from the slums of Hell to paradise in Heaven
From a slingshot to a wall of Mac-11's
I drank with the Devil and ate with the Reverend
We talked numbers and I told 'em, that mine was 7
The total amount of hits, behind the collapsed building
That had exploded in a frenzy of killings
Bodies lay near tons of twisted metal
Of a structure and atomic force, it leveled
From the tale of the tape, the product failed in comparison
The weight, the height, the reach, was not a year within
Sight, the significant, difference was the ammo
Wrecking y'all individuals in the nano
Second by second, heat blazed through the night
Leaving a dazzling array of neon lights
The primary reason of mission for them spitting
The firing kept hitting, them ducks that kept sitting
But the informants x-rays gave off electrons
Within a few next days, entire sets gone
Prenticle precisions used to remove the eyelids
Those responsible for my brothers with high bids
Life in the hood is an award winning film
Lived out by savages who can't escape the realm
A place where the young meet and greet with guns
In the park they interrupt the pure innocent fun

When I'm locked down I use Timbs as my shower slippers
I'm in the background mingling with the powder flippers
In the basement, hard-body power lifters
I crush sour in the sifter, see how I lift her
Universal God I stay scientific
The kid with the Golden Arms, Iron Fisted
Stay Asiatic, so cinematic
Noise in the attic, bang out with them automatics
It's hood politics that bring the hunger back
I'm straight chopping wood, call me the lumberjack
Check the catalog put out a hundred packs
Watch for drug sniffing dogs they coming from the back
I'm straight thunder clap the funky drummer's back
It's pure Dopium, give em a heart attack
I stay stacking plaques like ancient artifacts
Joe Namath in the game I'm the quarterback


Eight balls of coke, blunt to the greenery
Pounds in the trunk get you a concrete scenery
Handmade ox'll get you dumped in the mess hall
Snitch niggas run to C.O.s to confess all
This is street knowledge, knowledge I school college
Like a speech from the GZA, sharp like the RZA
Don't run with a scissor, nigga the truth is the
Truth, now I'mma drop a few jewels in the booth
Used to boot crack, stuff em inside a tennis ball
Ans throw it when they rushing the block, trust no cops
Driving around with two mitts in my socks
Cooked coke gon' get you in more trouble than money
Don't crawl through dust juice the pigs is hungry
You think they ain't watching
They watching while you uptown copping
Back home while you're cooking and chopping
They scheming on the block waiting to get it popping


He had a sword and an axe with cuts
Under a road that was woven from silver and gold, waxed it up
His army was so great in quantity
His crops and livestock boost the economy
Many would travel by boat to see him
His image adorned most schools and coliseums
A merchant, hustle those silk and velvets
Portrait illuminated when the torch was well-lit
Picture so beautifully painted that
One thought it would breathe or move cause it would leave a mood
Or energy, you see his wife practiced Yoga
Made herbal enhancers that had saved the soldiers
Guard the treasures in the chambers, halls and vaults
Well-prepared for all assaults
Heavy guarded village
Armed with the sharpest weapons designed to pierce and cause blood spillage


From a young teen, a murder team, inspired by crime
See Allah Just granted permission for my position
Sit down, write rhymes, escaping this repetitive cycle
Slinging dimes, losing time, doing hard time
Teaching y'all mathematically, come see
The epitomy of what you wanna be - emcee
My semi-auto gun mandatory at the sound clash
The mic touched, dance mashed up, pounds of the best
Green glass bottles of don, I sip the liquor slow
Flow so devastating when I go solo
Even when I'm dolo, pretty gun I'm holding
Head swollen off the solid gold soul
Iron Mic pole beat your face like you stole something, trust me
Living life royalty, all wise and healthy
Welcome to the best of me, from knowledge to infinity
Never stopping my projectory, I'm galactic


Yo, peace to all of the gods and all of the earths
We been building like this ever since the first day of birth
The more I start to build, the better I feel
Keep ignorant niggas from me, use dummies for shield
You're not Godbody son, you're just garbage and real snotty
Cherry head gaylord still stuck in the lobby
This the first Now Born, son I'm blessed with mad lessons
Conquered crazy devils, my mind is a weapon
You can't fast with me and avoid the swine
You degenerate emcee, I'm the best of mankind
Allahu Akbar straight jewels and real stars
I'm down with the RZA, got help for the Widow's Son
Pop off on you, you ain't nothing to me - DUN DUN
Original Tyzeem, Holy water, Visine
Designated wordplay, God respect my deen
Shine on little stars and respect the Queen


New York Giant, call me Deck Umenyiora
Fresh with the water connect, two and a quarter
Deal with the dealer, don't trust the transporter
My job is done once I get it to the border
Perico, coke game is kilos of cocaine
Hypodermic needle to the groove, I dose veins
Overdoser, you know the product is raw right
Lines take you there like I wrote it with off-white
Got him bent up, hands looking like a tin cup
Sorry no consignment, get your ends up
Move from the gate now, he on his way straight to Jake now
I'm on the hush with my weight loud
Got the shakes now, how they want it bad
Five or six heads chipping in for a bag
I got the works like a burger deluxe
Get your fix while I'm serving it up, word to us




The Buddha Fist and the Lohan Fist trace from the same
Basic technique and when competing against each other there is little to choose between them
But, the followers of the Lohan style want it more
Power for themselves and used their new masters help to eliminate all other contenders
The Buddhist style followers resisted
There was much conflict in the fighting world

General: Yes they do make good athletes, which one is he?
Instructor: That one



Every man is born good
But no man are the same
What he learns changes (the) man
Confucius so says "What a man learns, so he is"
Learning is the brains food
We eat well grow up good



 You can't tell the story without
Telling the story of Soul and what is it
 Well Soul is live, it's live at one of the more humble levels where you need more, you need more
Things that you think are real valuable
That mean s much to you
But I'm telling you if I had to got back
I think I would settle for one of the smaller things
Because it's a little more relaxing to the man



Now number two, practiced the snake style
He was known as the snake spirit
He had the speed of a snake


Niggas is like serpents out there

Serpents will bite
Lay outside, and then they roll back into they holes
They slither, in the streets of Brooklyn, New York
Slither in the streets, of Manhattan
In the streets of Queens, streets of the Bronx
Streets of Staten Island
Wherever you see em they slither
Whoever... yo
Fearsome shit... check it out
Yo, yo


It broke me up when they pat me on my shoulder
Said stay strong cuz his life is now over
I flash back to the heathens that he roll with
They shot him up and down nobody knows shit
My peers, little ears
Came up to me with a eye full of tears
Last night we was shootin dice and gettin nice
Kid rolled us, played us for our merchandise
We were in the hallway all day
Me, Steve and Little Ray
Probably at first they tried to rob me
Back me in the lobby, pull out the shotty
Then came Scotty, fragile body
My first impression, he returned from a party
He would just stagger, smellin like Bacardi
The Dragon, braggin, how he was fuckin mad hotties
Pressed on the elevator button, then all of a sudden
He licked off, about a dozen
Slugs from the cannon, that ripped through my cousin
Nobody was standing when the nigga started bustin
Blood started to flood the floors by the elevator doors
That's the last thing that I saw
Damn, we planned to make grands and buy a home




Jagged edge, rockin God, hard as Stonehenge
Pledged whoever crossed his path get scrapped with a sledge..
..hammer, he didn't give a damn about the manner
And on the block he was called by the momma's
And the grandma's, 'indecent', 'heathen', 'juvenile delinquent'
His weekends was frequently locked inside the precinct
His most recent cape for catchin papes
Was snatchin up snakes on a roof butt-naked hang em off like drapes
Then ask what's the combination to the safe, with the brace
And those who didn't reply they fell straight to their face
Razor blade sharp who invades the dark
And raid more spots than Spays and NARCS iron heart like Tony Starks
A fierce lion, who never leave the crib without the iron
And on the block he be slingin rocks and duckin from the sirens
Greetin niggas he loved with a pound, and a bear hug
Those who wanted life, they catch a slug from the snub
A Five Percent, who all knew was one to ten
He loved the Gods with his heart but his brain was filled with sin
And when he came through niggas be lookin out
Hopin he gets shot or tooken out, or locked the fuck up in Brooklyn House
In PC, on a liquid diet, but he was louder than a riot



Do the knowledge to a nigga named Trigga
Bad rude boy from the land of Jamaica
With visions to venture, to the U.S
To receive the gold that he couldn't acheive
In his country, even though he sold mad weed
For the next man, who was the Don of the clan
Niggas actin like they got the block locked
Like I can't sling drug raps and eat food
But I be the rudest, bad boy steppin gun totin
Shots lash out like a violent explosion
At the nigga, who tries to stop my production
Intervene the scene and slow up the cream
None of that black, East New York, gun talk
Niggas I extort from Baltic to Boardwalk
Memories of injuries wounds and burns
Walkin' through the streets of Medina I stand firm
Cause I know this, which means I can hold mine down
Without a doubt, niggas who front, get snuffed out
Justice must be born there's no escape
Cause a snake can't be reformed so I wait
Comin' in the name to proclaim your fame for protection
And you don't know no fuckin' lessons?



Bad, bad, Leroy Brown
Baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than the deep blue seaaaaa
Badder than you and meeeeee
Niggas comin thru the trees, like a salamander, bitin'
Like a piranha, but I'm bitin' you back, like a black pantha
The style I'm ampin' the... fuck my name, who I be?
Fuck the game, it's all about the moneyyyy!
Owahhaerahh, sometimes I get high with the Meth
Then I turn to the Killah Priest
When it comes TWELVE O'CLOCK!!
I turn into the demon beast, yo
Yo fuck that shit!

YO! SHOW THESE MOTHERFUCKERS WHAT TIME IT IS
 Rawwrarrrah
Rahhwarwaahauh, rawwaroar!!
WHO's THE BAD-ASS? *rawharrah*
WHO's THE BAD-ASS?
 Rawwwaahrah
[He practiced the snake style
He was known as the snake spirit] YEAHhhhhh


Lyrics, never waitin, twelve days, penetrated
When I come with the ruffness, mad niggas try to rush this
Slip into my killings, then I slays and you're helpless
When I try to stay sick, it's yacub grafted six
Calm for the kill, knowing the style that's ill
When I drop, lyric skills, brothers say, Buddah chill!!

I'm a dollar and a dream from seein a brick
In grimy hallways, slingin nicks and treys
When it's on then it's on and poppin, shots lickin
I'm spittin this shit for the hood, Glock clickin
Tension in the street, we stressed, still wanna eat
I walk through the valley of death, the hotstepper
Holdin red pepper, everybody on reach
I need a beat to expand, the mind guide the hand
Pen stroke, excellent quotes of literature
Nights over Egypt, black as Arabia
Gundeliro self I savior, I need the (uh)

Aiyyo, aiyyo
Aiyyo I got the whip smellin like lemon
Roger Clemens jerseys the man blew seven cold coolies in the Worthy and
I crush those rappers, keep the toast near the rad-iator
We like our guns warm, it's easier to make the papers
Stayed off, the cape came off, Ghost G'd off
The track's like doin six months and I'mma beat off
At the airport attention always flow in my direction like
You let the best then sparkle his perfection and
Bitches be askin them, Ghost you got so much shit
You need to cash in, bracelets matchin 'em


Yo, yo

Reunited on the radio, Wu-Tang superb

Sinatra, the pop the Jackson 5 recordings
Uptown Saturday, "Cotton Came to Harlem"

 (x2)
My guitar string sing
Make me wanna like, spit that thin, thing
When I'm on the mic talking to you, how you like?


I stimulate life and matter in my circumference
None could ever match my palm, I'm calm
So you know when I blow the bomb
It's gonna quake something like a migraine pain
It's gonna ache something stopping all motion
You could never move against the energy intensity
Knowledge my reality
Everything flow mathematically in order
My universal gravity pull is magnetic
Peace Allah victorious, Shabar B. Glorious
Mentally the mind see every speck of dust
And every cubic square inch
The God magnificent build and make the rhyme still back to the paper

 (x2)
My guitar string sing
Make me wanna like, spit that thin, thing
When I'm on the mic talking to you, how you like?


That's word from my Soul
I came to bring gold from the trader, he stole
And left you with a promise that was never fulfilled
I build and make the Earth quake
Catch a thought before it escape and write it down
I'm all so blessed, these words I manifest
My universal flag on my chest, Sun, Moon, Crest
Govern by the God of course, cause I'm a star black to the core
The mic so hot, it a blow the Fahrenheit
It's only one day, but I love it at night
Yo, let me build with you for a second

 (x2)
My guitar string sing
Make me wanna like, spit that thin, thing
When I'm on the mic talking to you, how you like?



*kung fu fighting*


It's the sound of the slums, drama with drums
You pop shots with the corks, cause a problem for some
Got the whole city up, floatin' with the semi tuck
Roamin' out of zone, and I'm known in the gritty cuts
And a Wu Killa Bee co-d, dumpin' off
Broad day, no macks, so you know it's me
Notice me, I shine like July sun
Live son, I'm a rider through provide one
Show the CREAM, I bust and blow the scene
In a fast car, kickin' up dust and smoke screen
Hit a nigga hard as Joe Green, his whole team
Feel it, swollen veins, a dope fiend feeling
Coming out the mouth, like you won't be killing
Yeah, you sold three million but you banned on the block
Long guns to your face, pass the mansion and yacht
And you ain't retaliatin' man, you ran to the cops


Uh, all gangstas and fellow MC's, we now meet
The threat is now an actual fact, and that's the least
The lion paw, ripping your jaw, dismantle face piece
You may not have heard of seen, my Murder One Team
Something's best untold, crime related
I am who I am, so fuck it, if son stuck it
We all lay to play to the best, sip the fine grace
My rugged lifestyle is survived, I don't apoligize
Hustle is the road I chose, there's no compremising
When the guns is drawn, shots fire
Son, all my killas is fam, nothing hired
Ya'll faggot niggas wired for sound, before the things blast
Wait for the train to past, man, face down
We straight from the murder capital town, it goes down
Daily on the regular, dressed in assassin attire
The bulletproof rap, strap 'em with the bomb to his body
Ain't no coming back...



 Uhh
 Deadly melody part two
 That's my word!
It ain't safe no more... bitch!


Yo, yo
Brain gets punctured and drained through the nasal
Hour of assassination be upon you
Movin with the tiger strike, bound, gagged and shot
Red the head in, dapple light centered
East remains hot with police
But I keep a lease for my, four-fifth automatic
Extended clip rewind, bust mine
Anytime you reveal your snakeish ways and actions
Observe the magnetic attraction


And it's time for some grid...


...iron rap, action-packed grudge match
Tough act to follow, hard copy novel
Throw you off the Verrazano
We swimmin with these sharks, yo I rate bodyguard
Stamp my initial in your birthmark
P.L.O., bust like a calico, tally ho
Black expo, Tecs in afros, we back yo
It's Dolemite, crash your windpipe, with the mic device
Fatal strike, daily mic fights, shoot out the street lights


Sight beyond sight, late night, city light
Tight like a virgin, mergin with my A-Alikes
Splurgin, dirty to the grain, no detergent
Filthy, innocent until I'm proven guilty
Submergin, deeper in the lecture I'm servin
Truth or consequences, life or death sentence
I'm hurtin, your person, I'm certain, it's curtains

Chorus: Method Man

It ain't nuttin like hip-hop music
You like it cause you choose it
Most DJ's won't refuse it
A lot of sucker MC's misuse it
Don't think that Wu can't lose it
Too much to gain to abuse it
The name of the game is rapture
This one is complete, it captures bass


Yo, I bring chaos to blocks like the riots in Watts
Rapid fire shots ripple through Kevlar, 9 Glocks
Technique of rhyme pop machine gun ammo
Sporadic flow buckled a foe, intro to outro
Calico, throw verse, but slide my dough first
I make thousands in the club with no shirts, go bezerk
From the Shao' borough, whylin out on the furlow
Commando, styles thorough, solo inferno
It burns slow, thermonuclear degrees
Heads are underseas down to the youngest seeds
Wannabes clone, they light like summer breeze
Hundred G's for the Garden, them fans stampede
For the top cats, hit the mic like the iron-palm blast
Equipped to perform the task
S-I-N-Y, and what, head or gut
The head rush, will cause your cerebellum to bust


We be the world's most fabulous
Hazardous, to fuck with these ravenous
Killers get you stuck to the wall like wooden cabinets
Extravagant, je-wel drop a helicopter high
Up into the sky, lines philosiphize, I got stocks to buy
Watch my pockets rise, to the bottom bust confide in God
In Sin I trust, the villianous, criminal minded killers rust
I intend to build and fortify in men
Mastermind rhymin, navigate the globe then retire quick


Aiyyo fluid rap bend through it black, buluga black Ac'
Tackle that, ghetto tabernackles throw it in your lap
Slang A-K, national, geographical
Mathematical, slide up in your work casual
Nike Air Dog, who wear it all, plus down to brawl
All a thousand with a bloody hair, flammable
Rap mayors, who clap Himalayas pinky fingers
Ever glacer, lacer, hand laser touches grail bomb blazers
Sly-workin, network bezerk, mad hurtin
Killer whales, fucking up sales, crash Bloomingdales
Masqevendo, John Lennon tenor break, mad descendo
Fuck y'all niggas carve my ice through your Benz window

*door creaking open*
*gunshots followed by a car alarm*

Chorus


Uhh.. Spazz-Ola.. (Spazz-Ola)
S-I-N-Y 10304
Lock your doors
Crack your jaws
Drop your drawers
It's all day everyday with this rap souflee






Looking on various street corners
I'm sure you've seen it yourself
Standing on the corner, is an alleged brother
Dressed in blue, or green, red and black
And starting the news, that the revolution is coming
And you better get ready, sort of like (I feel you son)
The end of the world is coming, unfortunately (I got you, though)
The world is just gonna drag on and on (I know how it is)
And we have a poem that we've written particularly (I said I know how it is)
For the brothers on the street corners


When the revolution come, you can see me on the front line
Firing my gun, standing right beside my son
If I go, it's understood that I stood for something
When my whole life, they told me, I was good for nothing
I was raised by the stray dogs, blazed off, layed off
Breaking laws, graveyard shifting every day war
Focus now, notice how, things change, soldier
I remain the same, I'm older now, I embrace the pain
I blame the struggle, nearly drove me insane
Thought I lost my head, till my brethren told me the same
No tears for the reaper, I've buried bout a thousand
In graffiti, "rest in peace" sprayed off throughout the housing
I tried to stay civilized, the hood's a prison inside
The only difference is the doors don't slide
Still we trapped in the animal cage, cause we got animal ways
So we react, with the animal rage
And my section's real, weapons peel, cheddar's the deal
Seen the depths of hell, now I stare, death in the grill
From the slave ships, to today's bricks, same shit
I'm awake, to the wickedness, and one, with the pavement


The all great mind stays divine, my hands remain deadly
We shine without the hung jewelry, produce light
That'll travel through mics, now as the time riping
We took words that we nourishing, encouraging
A nation to awaken, those who were sleeping
Can you conceive the thought? Transatlantic import
Slave and bought, secret relations between blacks and Jews
Might set a fuse off in the head
Many dead lynch hung, swung from trees
Brothers in the struggle together, eat from one pot
Hold each other down to the sneaker
Nothing come between us
Fast money and chicks, did it to the best of cliques
It's sickening... huh

 (x2)
It's me and you son, forever in the struggle
No doubt, we hustle, survival is the motto
Will you soon follow, a better tomorrow
...For a better tomorrow


I catch a few flashbacks about, going through the struggle
How we used to make dollars, from all the snow we shoveled
In a broke neighborhood, where the kids often dream
About a lavish life, that is mostly seen in the screen
Where some dreams are quickly cut short, due to gang violence
From loud guns, that kept witnesses, in deep silence
Was it bad timing? Jealousy from too much shining?
Or a set up, from a girl that he wined, kept dining
It's a known fact, they will attack, cause it's like that
And depending on the, kind of impact, that strike back
In a town where the talk is cheap and, beef is brief
A mother sobs uncontrollably, and exhibit the grief
Large holes in the front door, of a housing tenement
Allows room to retaliate, so conflict is imminent
This hate in the brain, destroys the cells like cancer
Even experts are stuck with more questions than answers




Yo, Allah Mathematics, tight mixtape shit
Ya'll faggot niggas back the fuck up
Ya'll bitches just back the fuck up


It's Da Great Siege, Killa Beez in fatigue
No time to bob and weave, your city's intrigued
Pushing straight through in a navy-blue H2 Hummer
We scrape you, it's a bummer, you dumber than dumber
Shaolin Rooftop Talk, who shot hawk?
Who got off? Bobby! Trapped in the Bing like my name was Crosby
Gettin' them Bills like Cosby
I'm up on Pickin
Bitch walked in, ordered veggie fried rice and a half a chicken
Like it's finger-licking' my finger clickin'
On some old finger-clickin', itchy trigger, nigga listen
It's Da Great Siege, Killa Beez in fatigue
You're gonna get intrigued
Your city's caught, no chance to bob and weave
BZA-Bobby, Shaolin Rooftop Talk, who shot hawk?

Yeah, bring it back.. huh huh

Bring it back, ahh, yo!)


Seen thousand dollars nights, broke ass days
Marvelous master haze, haggler, Isaac
Yo... yeah.. yeah, but yo, Masta Kill' stay milli'
Known to rock a butter soft leather when it's chilly
Peace to Philly, Chicago the Windy City
We rock goggle, bread with the mold
Out-dated can goods, witty and it cold
Behold the pale, Jonah escape the whale
Free Dirty, we gotta be the God
The Def Poet quotin', all side bets I'm takin'
Put your plate up, Rae dropped the eight on the brake
We on The Come Up, one up from takin' it all
Up in the pool hall, niggas ain't tryin' to pay without a brawl
Dusty, Two On Da Road, toad style
Mic stab low, winds straight from the soul, Shaolin pole





I awoke from oppression, I began to write for y'all
Truth from a speck of light
I chose to bring belief to those
That hunger for the food of thought
Cuz this is the life we chose
Fool's gold tempt many and led 'em astray
Others watched them go down
They was afraid to speak on it
Some never recovered from the mental enslavement
I came greatness
The world wasn't ready to face me

"Never.. the God too clever.. never.. he seen it comin..
Never.. the God too clever" ] Masta Killa


Now this wicked brother Cal
Ordered them to cover their faces painted with smiles
And they came, from air, land and oceans
I watched as the sides of good and evil was chosen
Everything seemed to move in slow motion
People ran frantic as herds of wild steed
Their minds like rabbits, souls like deer, fear was felt
And when the radiation melt the eyes from their heads
I fled seeking cover to find none
Triumph a selection played by RZA
Buildings crumbled
Missiles and bullets whistled, the Earth rumbled
Water filled tunnels quickly from both ends
Trucks dropped from buildings that swayed from high winds

"They thought he would slither.." ] Masta Killa


Trees buckled like knees
Continuing to build and break the seventh seal
From the sky came fiery hail, trains derailed
Horseman hooded with sheets shaped in concrete
War of the lion, voids thunder when I speak
From their finger came lightning, striking the beast 
Jail cell broken by the wise words spoken
Gun smokin'.. it's the def poet quotin'

"Never.. the God too clever.. never.. he seen it comin.." ] Masta Killa




Yo, yo, Wu-Tang Clan, still fatter

Yo, I block the bronze, the Kid Golden Arms

Burn through your body, you see about
A head Gotti, for Balardi, for Malatti, I'm scratchin' the table
Scratchin' the trashboard, lost laws
Of Dragon Breath, is like an Iron fire

Fuck y'all niggas talkin about?
My flow, right?

Everytime I did this shit, you niggas got hype yo
Superb's the next nigga, respect for those before me
In these last days, I'm bringin rap glory
In the streets they hear it, some will remember the lyrics
In my demise, some will remember me in spirit
And I ain't tryin to die like 'Pac and BIG
And lose my talent to a cultured thug life
I'm a man, seein mindstate of balance
Takes years, fam', like fuck y'all plans
See, we feel like stars, shine like stars
Fuck stars, fuck y'all, we examples
Samples of the hood, thugs from the hood
Young bloods in the hood like, they love the hood
They love the young bitches, nickel bags and guns
In the benches, we see it all off the benches
I learned how to sew seein niggas stitches
And the pain, don't even ask who 'bout the pain
They killed main, I won't maintain
By the bus stop, two blocks from the dust spots
Somebody busted shots, they said Sam got got
Damn, he wildin in the back cab rap
That eat swine, fucked his arms and hold nines
That's Far Rock for you, my block for you
Y'all bitches niggas only live in jail cuz ock know you
When I come home, watch how shots blow you
Through the upholstery, even through your mom's groceries
Little Sam died three months later
He got set up in the elevator, his cape was regulated
His name faded, he has a son by this bitch he dated
Shorty waited for two dead case kid
He'd get them niggas kids if he couldn't get them
Then one day out of the blue, BAM!
He heard shit like last names and cars rarin
The Larger Than Life niggas was about to leave here




My people stressed out, we seventy dead and starvin
Son couldn't walk through my yard past curfew
I rose from an era of terror where it was legal
To tote guns, get red and bust a nigga head
And if pussyhole for dead, left pussyhole for dead
What the fuck was his song?
Never heard of this till niggas started snitchin
I'm still stitchin motherfuckers up
I deal with high sciences, supreme refinements
Till any wicked germ is destoryed and burned
We the Gods without question
Prove what I'm manifestin, all show ways and actions
Hopeful that, lick your cannon
I'm ill when I shoot to peal like Ed O'Bannon
In my head is a thought, perm cocked, off safety
Shots fired, follow blood trails to the stairwell
Faced down, he lay sound, rounds to his crown
Shorty hip flock was midtown, big fly holdin him down
With the dead-arm, siren sounds
Bullets chip brick, precincts followed by the ambulance
Respond to the bomb threat
I picked up his MC tray through the masters
I'm sharper than my carpentry blade
The culture carven into mountains
The faces of my eight classmates
That stomp through the streets of states for Protect Ya Neck tapes
Wu-Tang T-shirts and bandanas
We snatch mics and snuff niggas who jack the rappin






Yeah... what? What?
Justice.. yeah.. check it out


I never hesitate to drop a verse, I rhyme first
Repeat it so often, it's well rehearsed
Rap stars, come through, rock the universe
I watch from afar just to see what they be doing first
Some was at they worst, dying of thirst
Others push through like the troops in Iraq, yo
But what did Bush do? See, I don't know a thing about politics
But flowing to the beat, is as dirty as my collar gets
The wildest child is gifted and talented
But change they style, will never wanna challenge it
You telling me to rhyme to the melody
I take time with my words like I'm in the spelling bee
If I don't make the grade, I don't make the record
Once that's accomplished, then my rhymes respect it
As long as we stay on track, and then
We can rhyme back to back, whatever, kid


One, two, we coming with the Wu
Three, four, we knocking at your door
Five, six, we eat them grits
Seven, to the eight, we don't hate
Nine to the ten, and we still wanna win..
(Wanna win, wanna win...)


Yo, I terrorize shorty with the Iron Palm
When I step on stage, I clutch the mic strong
That melody was flowing, while that beat was going
When the waves connect in my ear, that pen starts going
Cause when I get on the mic, I rock it so ill
That's why they call me the Little Masta Kill'
I'm like rock and stone, put together
These dudes come in my face like "blah blah whatever"
So I had to hit the dude in the chest, B
These little fake MC's just want to test me
I thought I told you before, I'm not a toy
I'm just a young boy, what? Doing my thing
Brooklyn, Brooklyn, with the Brooklyn slang, come on




Wu-Tang Clan Killa Beez
Rock all my enemies, with the double D's
Double CD's, ride for the enemies
With the rocking-the-mic right, roll up with the typewrite
Rocking my Nike Flight, ballin' with the nice
And I'm rippin' the mic right, and you know who it is
It's the Young kid P, from the Brooklyn side
Brooklyn's Finest, Brownsville
Knew our attack, and what the gats do, Plaza, all day, baby


Yeah... can't lose, and we still gon' win forever
Young Godz forever
Peace to the Gods and the Earths forever
Kareem Just, Shamel Irief, the Young Prince
Yeah, yeah, Allah Just you know how do this thing, man




Yo man get ya ass in here man
You know the fucking Police looking for you man?
Come on man - them niggas just left here man
Come on man you know we got mad fucking blow
Up in the Motherfucking lab son
This nigga's off the hook man
Yo Chef talk to these niggas man


We're bagging ounces in the back of the Maz'
Ostrich on, Woolrich's, three Quarter-ness
A.D.I.D.A.S. with Stan Smith's
The grant's on the Stove
And Aunt Lo about to come to the Lab-o
She giving me some credit for clothes
That's the slang work for bricks, dicks
Analyze you neva know who looking
It's deranged world - where snitches is enterprising
Black Man hold on, like magnums in the wind
Cause when it get cold, parole give a homey like ten
What's the prognosis; drugs, guns, and ounces of Gold fish
Fly reefer outta town, bitches is stone six
And birds back with 18 and played C.R.E.A.M, gray beam
Its lean new A.D.I.D.A.S jackets, flipping up small dean
Visualizing portraits, fresh cuts, brand new Porsche's
Going with hand-to-hand, serving the Source
Yo, running from the Police
This day-to-day lifestyle where niggas get arraigned
And get chain, it's like Psycal -- blaow!!


Drug dealers, star and celebrities (Ghetto celebs)
Even dudes with a few felonies (A few felonies)
In the PJ's this what they telling me (Telling who?)
Sniffing real hard but you're not smelling me (Smell me)
The crowd yelling for 'Chef' 'Killa' and 'Pete Rock' (Pete Rock)
Got 'em moving like the millennium beat box (Beat Box)
Shit is all good 'til they hear the heat cock (Whooo!)
Fall back and let the beat rock


Degrees of experience qualifies me to speak in certain areas
Where many can't reach, so I prepared a speech for y'all
To then listen while I spit the hot venomous shit
My whole clique sick, infested with the itchy trigger finger mob related
Noodle-leanie universal flag beanie
Son you wouldn't want to see me black down, Masta .4 pound
Clip full of hallow tip round
Turn the fucking sound up
My cup running over Hennessey; the Bill Bixby
Ninja Scroll, niggas that roll
My son did four in the hole
Tenant population, neva told, facing parole
Sipped the old gold style, beat it in trial
Mild-mannered .9 bandit, flow drunk
Look at skunk weed sticking
Razor sharp rip 'em, bites lift 'em
We at the Jam direct
The ghetto gospel, collaboration
One work could change the nation
No doubt!




Tuna salad and Puma rackets pushing through the projects, captain
Get your money, yo show me no slacking
We drive the meanest joints
Shoot through Medina with a Evisu jeans and nina's
Stop by juniors we're hitting cheeba
Briefly, crackers observe
You got the undercovers
Niggas just love us, yo we know that they suckers
You know what? - What? Mosey don't be nosey yo!
Watch these fake niggas with these Thank You cards
Them shits is bogey
Snitches in the hood up to no good
We would kill a lot of mothafuckas but the timing ain't good
So while my bankroll climbing
I'll be out on consignment, breezing
Ki's with 29 letters melted the cheeses
All of my paper now in real estate
White folks been doing this since '69
It's billions and killer weights
So prosperous moves with the jewels, with Wu Nikes on
It's cool don't eva act like niggas ain't new - one!




Yeah! we just sit back - in the luxury toasters
Sliding through the mothafucking projects
Stand away from you fake ass mothafuckers
Laying up in the barberShop, getting fucked up cuts
We don't respect y'all (Don't respect y'all)
Knaw'saying? This is Shala Louis Rich
Pete Rock, Masta Killa, The Vatican
One! I'm gone




Yo, I gotta be around this music, it's therapeutic
The first fresh thoughts of the day is so clear
When I walk, in my head, there's a voice that talks
In my ear I can hear so clear, you think I'm buggin' right?
I'm just contemplating the silent 
Out to the West Side my killer Cali gangstas
Ride and get the head right
Yo son, I'm on the next flight in
Twist some  I'm guaranteed the right of his psalm before we reach
Throw the instrumental on it, watch  pattern of speech
Man-formed military arm ready to swarm, get your party on
Drinks on the house tonight, ladies lookin' right
Atmosphere nice and warm, we backstage like a hundred thieves strong
Ghost want the red light on before we get on
An hour's too short to rock, we got a million songs


Yo I gotta be around this music, it's therapeutic
Like my first blunt of the day to start the movement
I'm sittin' in the room with a view, there's always room for improvement
So I grab my coat and go and prove it
Just me against the world, you can find me in the streets
She'll spot me in the lobby, probably find me in the free
Cop a 'Rari, the  in the lining of my seats
Tryna put me in a lineup til' I wind up in the beast
That's the belly, how dare they tryna tell me when to eat
With a plate of food barely in my reach
My team shoot dice, we used to shoot skelly in the streets
Wear the same Pelle-Pelle's for a week
But now we livin' life
A such a good life I wish that I could live it twice
I'd probably make the same wiz my wife
It's Wu-Tang Clan, always collect cheddar
Proper education, always correct errors


Yo, bananas, Redman so gorilla
Chi-town know I'm pimping the mic, nigga
One hit, and chicks follow me like Twitter
Crack when I talk, I like the mic steam up
The fiends hit it, chicks swing with it
I'll box niggas in like Don King did it
Sixteens I write, it's seems so vivid
My notebooks I let the eBay did it
I get dough, bad pair for the sick flow
My weed more greener than Lou Ferrigno
My right-hand man hand on the pistol
I crack these squares up like Nabisco
Oh, look at me, I'm lightweight
But with the heart to peel back your white meat
Yo wifey want me to make her wifey
Hit it, make the bitch hyphy at high speed, Doc




When the road is gone, and you can't find no way
So don't you threaten my, my, my friend now
It'll be another day


Black male, jail cell, same hell, murderous prospects
Drain ale, same pale, buck shots, reign hail
Same meal, stepping like robot, pain kill
Trail stream from silk screen to nine mill
Crush my will, cook a meal like rosewoods
I'm coming for them gold goods, precision like dope head
My biscuit toasted, open fine hoes, acid for flat bread
Solicit, catch casket dripping, unbutton hostlers
Embroidered clips in, Chicago Bear puff, quick to snare off
Pick six to carry off his coffin
While I'm often pterodactyl off white widow with horsemen
Back to the Wall Street lawn, heaters and more shit
My literary literally drown your war ship
Send a shell now tear up your style to the corporate
First forty eight hours is never seen, no force could measure me
The hunts off when he endorse my treasury
Yellow apparition, smell a kush and incense
I dwell on benches where the Air Force is scared to going off course
Burn your after murder spree then I'm off to witness
Double dutch and I don't mean the ropes, I'm off the benches
Coughing endless, kill me and spends off a genius intention
Bring the nigga henchmen, spend shells on and on it was expensive



Now there's one thing I should mention, massive pounds of pressure
Nothing can hold me, watch as I levitate gravity
None could match me, cave chest cavity
Basic mathematical flow, like the max spray
Monumental word play, carefully construct the measurements
When you weighin' up, refining to it's higher science
A spill of carbon, one gun shot of diesel
A microphone touch of mission, plan an eruption
Underworld corruption, don't trust him it's sadly to say
You might have to bust him one day, I thought I told you



Broad day bullets over Broadway for more pay
Verbal assault, you bitches rep more then foreplay
All day, this is routine, not a facade
No mirage, no regard, no HBO Entourage
Bloodsport, caught with the force, Star Wars, Skywalker
Offin' your boss, tossin' your broad
And there's no shells, left in the drawer, spit them in raw
Nobodies leaving til we settle the score
Chose the high road, never look down, like if my eyes closed
Mine flows, trying to get mine, before the time goes
Ayatollah mind controller, free of the blindfolds
Survive with 50-47's, the nines blow
Dip don, boss underdog from the rip bomb
Click strong, Melo with the handle like the Knicks on
Clips drawn, ducking the blues, choose a fit form
Big arms, lay down your king, only six pawns


My friend, he's an expert, in ninja
Give this letter to him, he will come
Mmm...
What is this ninja?
I'm not familiar
Is this from him?
Watch out!
This may contain poison, don't touch it




Mot got me acting like a fucking goat in here
Yo god, remember back in the days god?
When we came a long way and shit, man (no question)
We supposed to be blessing each other
On our physical days and shit, you know what I'm saying?
It's like basically, I wanna hit my family with like land and all that
Diamonds and all that, we ran through that chamber dun


Mainly stack mine, indeed it's been a long time
Let me feed y'all, fruits of life, shut up and eat y'all
Flavors for neighbors, Wallee's down to gators
The whole configuration stacking paper
Yo we do this, on the low though
If so, we running John Dolo
First thing, you need if you don't know
We carry cause it's a real world, show and prove
In ill words, all my herbs know the slurge
Dress nasty like fuck, keep my bird on the job yo
You got to straighten up
Do the worst thing to hurt her heart, damn
Took care of that, shared, even shed a tear for that
Bust my gat to throw gear on her back
Damn son, why she taking you through that?
She's a part of me, pardon me flow Allah, we sworn we
Wising up, take care of home bases
Then we slide to another part and start more hatred
Life is sacred - the other side of that paw, you lie naked
Clothes in the box, go 'head take it
Flash back Jew status
Salute moms and get ya boots splattered
Batting average, your moms had it
Just a broke young dumb, full of cum ready to haunt something
Takes something of yours, here you want something
Growing up around fifteen
Watching how the big niggas rolling wit big cream
Big schemes
Quick to flash your gat, laser beam
Pool table action black, hundred stacks made my niggas leave
Some be saying "Let em breathe"
The others wanna deceive
How we gonna make it if we don't achieve?
Right now, catch it from a vertical degree yo
We starting showing our asses, committing burglaries
One got caught, threw us all off
Threw us in the hell section near the boardwalk
Wondering how the sword talk, did he fall off?
Did he stand like the hawk that he was in New York?
Kept the waves spinning on the cross, of course
Come back a little cutty endorse
Risked it for his kids the pain is lost
We sitting back on a better note, yelling "Peace god
I love you love you to death, you thoroughbredable"
The Robbin Hood of the hood
Sit back, it's all good
Won't spoil it if we call it, we all hood, ha ha


I make knowledge born to save self, you know?
Who gon' live it, gon' live it
Be is to be a born, know what I mean?


Soaked in degrees of knowledge, polished by sun rays
Carving by nine swordsmen
To a needle point of perfection
It's a blessing to deliver this lesson
While traveling the planet, extending development
And vote for the mind
Never ended we now send it long winded
Descended infital, Bobby Digital
Abbot of the Shaolin 'Isle
With knowledge and wisdom
Of the original sword style begin
Birth of the Wu-Tang Clan




*whistling*
*beat kicks in*
Di-Di-Di-Di-Di-Digital


Yo, I beat the case, now I face the acquittal
You nizzles try to belittle, but ya'll lest in spittle
From a baby's lip, the digi made me flip
Plus they paid me chips, just to spray the clip
And empty out on you, in sync like the SMPTE output on the MPC 2002
We be housin' crews, plus we housin' fools
In abandoned apartments with a thousand tools
Crazy shootin' dudes buck off the beat
Brainless boutless fools who be stuck off the leaf
Two guns in their hands yellin' "Fuck the police!"
On the weekend get drunk and they fuck with the niece
Of the precint chief, she got the tattoo
On her breast that's shaped like The W
Go 'head snatch the guns, son, I'll cover you
And if they get past me we got another two, yeah...


We smoke those blunts the size of bats
We got those gats as long as ax
We snatch that cheese right off the trap
We put those Beez all on your map


I shoot the fair one, I dare ya'll run through New York City
Or any city or place, my face, royal taste, pace myself
Ace my health, great with wealth
Undetected like the wings of a Stealth, I move for self
Or any man, woman or child that I call fam
That's the way I am, word to Glock, my sister Pam
Son, lived through the terror of the World Trade blues
Nine o'clock news, abused the mind of many fools
Braves and jewels, made my moves, paid my dues
From the School of Intelligence, I stayed benevolent
Most high, magnify, multiply, as I add to the Kings of Kings
We never die, built my name, sustained like blood
Flow through the veins divine sign
Dine with wine forever sunshine




We smoke...


From the Vil to Brazil, live on your C-SPAN radio band
Explicit, dice kiss it, pour a little liquor
Golden imported from Cuba, Miss Aruba
Sexy as Asia, met her up in Mecca
Getting up in Just Cipher, hit it on the first date
Plotted my escape, twelve hours shift at the gate
How can you beat a G a week in '88?
Trips to the Pocono Lodge, the fresh Izod
Mama shouldn't work so hard to pay the landlord
A grand in your birthday card, times is hard
The gun hammer click, when the pigs blitz
We scramble like Vick, automatic six plus one to the head
Yo, the east so hot, it's red, but that's home
And my Glock still burn your skin to the bone
Sonny Corleone don't discuss it on the phone






What's this whole world, coming to
Things just ain't the same...


Leather gooses, sheep skin coats and bombers
British walkers, shark skin tailor made
Playboys black suede, three finger rings
Name plate, rope chains, BVD nylon
Gazelle frames, matching with the Kangol hat
You couldn't have that, brothers might snatch that
Flashback, 190e, with the mock neck
Lee suits, 25, nigga, we shoot
Fresh blue and white Puma or the track night
Shelltoe Adidas with the fatter, no laces
Late night, summer time jam, we in the park
DJ cutting, MC spitting his dart
A Sergio Tacchini brown suede ballet
Jay cross town to Delancey, jew the jew now
Fresh leather winter weather, maxima spoiler kit
Legendary deuce flicks, Slick Rick
Run-DMC, Jam Master Jay, hah
Wu-Tang Clan, Scott LaRock, KRS-One
Damn, brothers like Pun, hah
I had a Jaz-O tape, me and my crew, hah
Walk the avenue, sky was blue, half past two
Used to Cold Crush, M-O Dee, Treacherous Three
Spoonie Gee, Busy 'Killa' Bee
Crack never kept him high longer than five minute
Wallabee Clarks of course, silk and linen
Jumbos two for five, come and get it
Mama cried, tears of fear, when I was wilding
Saying 'please don't wear that, people getting killed for that'
Latin Quarter, Union Square, you had to be there
The Fever, MC Global
Ripping the armory, this is hip hop to me


A few years ago, a friend of mine
He had to go away and do some time
Before I kick this rhyme that I'm about to say
I got a letter he wrote, and it went this way


Yo, let's shoot the fair one, take it to the back of the building
A Train to the Junction where the Gods is building
Valor Fila suit, fresh from Simon's
Canal Street jewelry, door knocker earrings
Leather skirt, Louis Vitton, Yves Saint Laurent
Polo goose weather, Benetton, Audi or the rag top Jetta
Lumberjack, mink Jew hat, suede front sweater, quarter filled leathers
Triple beams used to measure, waves to the side
Three sixty round the back, before the flat top
Stone love classics, silver hawk athlete
Live at the Biltmore, my flow cocoa libio
You can never catch my super rhyme Kurtis flow
I fifty two head to toe, crazy hummer side
Tomahawk, streets I walk, Hardy Boy sex boys take money
Rikers Isle, nobody smiling, jolly stompers
Sing Sing Spotford, TNT NARCs, they rush and try to knock us
Halloween masked up, buck fifty stitch cut
Lands of the kings and Tuts, peace Sauron
Latif, little Shareef, brother AD
High school cutting out to Coney Island Beach
I prepared this lesson, and read directions




So patient, they sat there in the aisles and waited
For the testimony, hungry, for a statement from the one and only
Thristy for the ceremony at hand, true Wu die hard fans
Now look how we rock, make 'em freestyle drop, old school like the Wop
My grandaddy used to do this dance called the Slop
I keep it hip hop for ya'll, we don't stop
Got ladies by the flock, no safety on the Glock
Stop, look and listen when the semi-auto's pop, your neck
Mock with the rope, who can match palm
I'm strong as a nuclear bomb, dangerously armed
Have you not prepared yourself, you've been warned
Gun shot to the informer, Killa Bee Swarm
Caught 'em on the corner of Lavonia
Reported missing, found him in the fetal position
Shot twice, armed with the rocket
Blind for the target, deaded on arrival
Suspenseful, kill or be killed, pass the rifle

--instrumental break--


Got to have hip hop music, can't live without it
Niggas wanna see you without it, I wouldn't doubt it
You better stay bout it, on to the break
Face on fist, Wu-Gambino for life, you heard of Noodles
East New York militant, ready to kill
Still drop Universal Truth, when I build
Make time stand still, in the reign of steel
Blew breath in his body
Tought her how to take aim, and cock shotty
Soon the gates, spray the paves
Rough cut Timberland stuff, kick your teeth
Back in the days...




Still living by the code too many pretty women still living by the...
I'm just tryna get a meal
When I started rhyming wasn't tryna get a deal I was tryna get a feel
Homocide housing bodies lying in the Hill, man they nothing with me dying in the field especially when I'm tryna pay the bills
A lot of y'all relying on the steel
And see the court denying your appeal
If y'all don't know, nothing you better know its real
If it work like a workshop better know the drill
I'm past childish games, y'all just tryna take me outta my game
And calling my black women out of their name
I'm serious stay out of my brain
Understanding my slangs, Fast and Furious, stay out of my lane
Boy I'm hot, kids be calling me Blaze
In the industry I'm not, they be calling me slave
I ain't tryna burn the spot, but I'm setting my ways
I'm just a Product of the block and the city I'm raised
I'm still living by the code
Too many pretty women still living by the stroll daddy pimping them for dough
Early in the morning cops kicking in the do'
Man I Think somebody's snitching on the low
I caught my father sniffing on that snow
That's when he tried to tell me things are different than before
Kids don't listen any mo', thats fo' sho'
We used to ask permission from my fo'
Ain't no food up in the kitchen cause we broke
I ain't tryna miss Another, meal cause love it get you killed
And if it dont your baby mother will
But y'all ain't recognizing that is, real untill that undercover pulls his shield and now it's kinda late to cut the deal
So I ain't gotta tell you how I feel
While im tryna get my pockets stuffed with hundred dollar bills
I should've went to school and get a skill
But it wasn't in my future so I stealed, that's why I got this Ruger in ya' grill


Cracker treasure chest is one of the best
Now, feel the force of the full Court press
I apply to kiss the death, something for real the realness
Untouchable, Eliot Ness, you select of vet
Take me off the bench, I suppose to lynch,
The angel in the air you can smell my stench
Soldiers in the trench, moving east to west
I gave you a note, you can keep the rest
RIP the whole coast when I heat the flesh
At the greek fest, hit a couple of bars
Smash rips on strips like bumber cars
You're amongst the odds, with lies in the pelly
The baby, nine, the size of a celly
Now it's a dilemma like Nelly and Kelly
Milk Pirelli Tower when I peel it in a hurry with a fist of fury
Martini with a cherry is very necessary when I make it to the top
I'mma pop Halle Berry Staten Island fairy where the legends were made
In the staircase throw a rap grenade
Take it back in the day, get clapped for your chain
"F" the blood bath it will be half of the pain
He is a high grand bullet women call him daddy
Fish tank shoes jump out the Caddy
Grand finale yo the champ is here
The cameras glare under the chandelier
While you standing there, like you can hold it down
Its nine of us all of us rock the crown
Tear it down down to the last compound
New York mixed with a Compton style
Roll bonkers wild, on the stomping ground
Lay down the carpet when I'm walking down the isle
Then Telephone  keep stalking the child
Four misdemeanor now I'm going to trial
So secluded in exile like my sex while
Private jet style who's the livest vet now`
Pass me a wet towel don't get Vexed now
I ring it your chest when I let the tech growl


We used to rock um, leather gooses
With sheep skin coats and bombers
British Walkers, sharp skinned tailor made
Playboys black swede, three finger rings name plate rope chains
DVD, nylon cazal frames and matching with the Kangol hat
You couldn't have it, brother might snatch it
Flashback 1 90 E with the mock neck

Wu-Tang Clan, Scott La Rock, KRS-ONE
Peace to like Pun
I had a Jaz-O tape, me and my crew
Walk the avenue sky was blue half past two
It's the Cold Crush Moe Dee, Treacherous Three, Spoonie G
Bizzy Killa Bee, yeah yeah
See crack never kept me high longer than five minutes
Wallaby Clarks  of course silk and linen
Jumbos two for five come and get it
Mamma cries tears of fear when I was wilding son
Please dont wear that, people are getting killed for that
Latin quarter union Square you had to be there
The fever, MC glory, ripping the armoury
This is Hip Hop to me, and for all of y'all, this is Wu-Tang Clan
Signing off, you know how we do forever


Ay yo I gotta be around this music it's therapeutic
Lick my first  blunt off the day then start the movement
I'm chilling in a room with a view, there's always room for improvement
So I grab my coat and go and prove it
Its me against the world, you can find me in the streets
You don't spot me in the lobby probably find me in a freak
Cop Ferraris, the law be in the lining of my seats
Tryna put me in a line up till I wind up in a beast
That's the belly, how dare they tryna tell me when to eat?
With this plate of food barely in my reach
My team shoot dice, we used to shoot skelly in the streets
Wore the same pelli pelli for a week
But now we live the life, its such a good Life
I wish that I could live it twice
I'll probably make the same wish my wife
It's Wu-Tang Clan always collect cheddar
Proper education always correct error


Crime scene, coppers and sirens helicopters
High beam the tension is Rising
Fiends keeping they pipes Clean
This is what life's mean?
A dollar and a dream everybody wants nice things
The kid was only 19, hole in his chest now, he's fighting
For his last breath to seeing death is frightening
The grip on the ghetto is tightening
You try to do the right thing, and they do you just like King
Now I can hear the night scream sirens and light beams
 bad shots, hitting people that they didn't mean to pop
The neighbourhood's in shock, block extremely hot
Another black teen shot is a normal routine for cops
They should've got good grades, work the minimum wage
Now they lying on the stretcher with nothing in them to save
Keep it ghetto, and whatever ghetto you at
Just don't love the ghetto, cause the ghetto don't love you back


Gotta be around this music it's therapeutic
First fresh thought to tell you so clear
When I'm Walking my head, There's a voice that talks
In my ear, I can hear it so clear (you Think im bugging right)


The average man, wouldn't last that lang
She like to work out run Marathons
She wear, tight skirts with no panties on
She's a 6 foot 1 bronze amazon
Saying, complaining about all the good men gone
I'm from Babylon she reach the 
Holding jails in the nail salons
She rock Coco Chanel her smell was strong
With skin like velvet, she rocked my bags
She gave, no 
She a spread eagle at the tip of the bed
She rubbed on her legs this is what I said
Rap music is therapeutic to me
Rap music is therapeutic to me


Ay yo You ain't lived 'till you made your first million
And top models wanna pop out yo Children
I thought I told you Wu tang is for the Children
Way Before rap moving crack in your building
Yeah, now whats the price of rice in China
These women tryna raise the price of her vagina
Me, Im tryna live and get the grinder
Like Diddy, but I ain't tryna give the Shyne up
Pop pop pop off no question
See Ol' Dirty like it raw no protection
When the kid hold court no objections
Meth needs his Money out the door no exepction
I go hard in the paint on a rapper
I go harder on a Xanax and Viagra
You Think im tripping, aiming the trick and
But keep a snow Bunny in the kitchen I'm the master like Killa






What y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
This '97
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to '79


I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultraviolet shine blind forensics
I inspect you, through the future see millennium
Killer Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets, Queen Bees ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block


As the world turns, I spread like germ
Bless the globe with the pestilence
The hard-headed never learn
This my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life standing firm
On foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
Transform into the Ghost Rider
A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire
Who got my back in the line of fire holding back?
What? My peoples if you with me, where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
What the blood clot? We smoke pot and blow spots
You want to think twice? I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums


I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
Vocabulary 'Donna talking, tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what? Run for your brother kid
Run for your team and your "six can't rhyme" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme, your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts, paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought
I got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God


The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang


Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape Hell globe spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anaesthesias
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings


March of the wooden soldiers, C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square we stay in gold like Flair
Escape from your dragon's lair
In particular my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat bass lines on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck, I'm ducking five-year probation


War of the masses, the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song


The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none


Yo Yo Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink, you had a Navy green
Salamander fiend, bitches overheard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cork-pop convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese, is that so?
Ceaser needs the greens, it's Earth
Ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz


Aiyo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer, Blue-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor world tranquilizer
Adjust the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening
Guaranteed made 'em jump like Rod Strickland






Weve just received a report that New York City is under attack by swarms of killer bees. Theyve been seen approaching from Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. We urge you to stay in your homes at this time, as we will be bringing you up-to-the-minute information. This just in: Police are reporting that theres a man on top of a skyscraper, ready to jump. Im told that he is possibly Ol Dirty, a member of the Wu-Tang Clan. The police suspect that there could be some connection between this old dirty man, and the killer bees

This is hip-hop, M.C.'s get busy
It's not pop, you'll front and you'll get dropped
You're listening to slanged out goodies, and Timberlands and hoodies
With the rhythm that came from the streets


I was a young one at the time, but started Mic Trippin'
Had rhythm like Ali, when he was rope skipping
I got crazy, when I heard the break beat
I used to lose it on niggas on 4th and Main Street
They couldn't stop the attack, once I moved forward
Many was drawn back, assault was seen awkward
Only armed with the bow, and a mad flow
Poisonous arrows on a mark, that was set to go
Traveling at high speeds, towards a target
I never hit bystanders in crowded markets
Documenters catch this most intimate footage
In the center they come close, label it the hooded
Remarkable clips, of an uncut episode
They was given the safe, but never was left the code
Close up of those, who have paved the road
Invincible armor like that nigga we call The Toad




Havoc on the block, shots from the ratchet, sizzle pop
Slugs spinning outta control, body's drop
You know the saying in the hood, fuck the cops
Certified on the clock, them ducks with metal Glocks
It takes place on the planet in rocks
Take nothing for granted, raised by these thieves and bandits
The enchanted, sticky green keeps my eyes slanted
Hard times coming up in the ghetto, but the Sunn manage
Watch me take advantage, get it, split it, panoramic
The notes I quote, water like the great Atlantic
Never catch me frantic, swift with the antics
Bitch niggas vanish, niggas, they run rapid
Sun of a Man, son of the sun, son of a gun
Breaded from the slums of each one and teach one
What's done is done, son, the game is made
Stay sharp like switchblades, continue to get paid




You know a muthafuckin' hit when it split ya wig back
Young Gatling, strapping a .38 revolver
It's going down, wait for the sound, my soldiers rally round
Ninja men, blending in, with the surrounding
'Nuff gunmen, 'nuff Flatbush yardmen strapped with the vest
No pussy test the God, the grounds is well held
Illegal desert eagle, cadaver dog
Search for the body that's lost, of course, it's BK
You heard niggas got killed for sheik coats and big ropes
Legendary students that sold coke, some blocks that's still hot
From shots popped back in '88
The black gate where son lay, never made the paper
Just another caper pulled by a masked killer, broad day light
Crown Heights, some are Fahrenheit, heat blazing
Cops on the beat, stop the money flow of the street
My dough is whole wheat, the fam gotta eat




"Come On!" - scratched up
"This is hip-hop" - repeated through the scratching




Yo.. yeah
Don't erase none of that good shit in the beginnin
Yo.. spill drinks on ya, get stank on ya
Yo.. yo.. pinky ring shit, yo
That pinky ring shit, yo


It's that pinky ring shit, the legend of masked kid
Shoot out the speakers when my guns get jurassic
Superbad, who am I? Dolemite classic
The vandal's back, hands on Angela Bassett
I handle my plastic, gunplay I mastered
No coke, dope mixed down with acid on record
Broken down and crafted in seconds
Lady's choice, the golden voice still peppered
Better, respect it, bitch believe
I pull rabbits out the hat, tricks up my sleeves
I air out the showroom, the shit can breathe
Fix your weave, behold my expertise


I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back
I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back


Take it back to the peoples, leanin' gettin' rec room punch
We in them authentic alley switchin joints
Major general niggas, five stars
Both arms rock when coke dropped we read a hundred niggas palms
Silencers, garbage bags of hash
For every cop we paid retired now the nigga on smash
Gash you out your burner fast
You swing down hatin me now respect get your fingers off the glass




Yo what the fuck yo?! Yo what the fuck y'all comin for?
Get the fuck away from my door!
We got big guns in here, coke over there
With blue bag and E pills stashed under the chair
And there's Boss Hog black and white pit with the pink lips
Stan thought he was soft 'til he bit his fingers
The shit had me dyin yo, big fat nigga bleedin
Big cat nigga all season
On the beach truck, stuck with Hawaiian ice
Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought FUBU
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
18 karat rap between noodles




Up at Killa Bee headquarters, four whips just pulled up
I saw Johnny sippin Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin off the hip
I sit took three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead king, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ".. Any Means Necessary"


John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all get shot


New York, New York, legendary rhyme boss
Code name Charlie Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
You crash-tests can't measure the threat
I dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah
Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin, feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself
The Noble, Sir I mass mogul
Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals


This is grown man talkin, coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect father Eton with Addies
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see


From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets









Apocalypse Now, mind over matter
Next batter be Tical, put it on a platter
How much uncut raw shit we dealing with?
Murder track what? Slang killing it, touched
You feeling it in your bloodstream
Deadly Venomous elixir hammer like Sledge that be Sister
All In Together Now, follow me the Mister
Mef Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh
Death come in the scripture, 2001
Bring the rap Armageddeon, let it be known
When you walk up in this Dead Zone, with all that wack shit
Now you know you dead wrong, one thousand lashes


Detonate that, pussy Massengil rap cleanse that
The kids rank, snatch collars off while riding off
Float boat big boys, Oakland A's stashed away blades
Ventilation let the sharks Animaze
Something shiest like seven butcher knives
Rolling Rover style twice, finger itchy like lice, hair fell out
Something to conquer, stomp ya like that cat Blanka
Toy Tonka truck, ten carat on ya monster
Ring rocky like fuck switch sides like water rides
The DAT bubble life preserve the other guys
Now fuck y'all act wilder
The style wilder than a praying mantis, chilling like
(long inhale)


As my brothers and I reign rebellious, changing
The courses of time, devils no longer exist
As God Cipher Divine, all minds one, no question
Now check it
Perhaps we can go through Lessons
Or might shot me a pussy protesting
Coming with that lip professing, you must take Allah for fool
Where's his Jewel? Was he using Mathematics as a tool?
Tell me, the struggle is God and I came to build
Shit is so real, inside you distilled
Back in the form of mist, you wishing you did the Knowledge
Before speaking, seeking, where you went wrong
And why would I bring you such physical harm?


Mind arson, my squadron surround the SoundGarden
Guns for hire plus you under fire and a target
Sniper in the cypher, I Pied Piper
Move the housing by the thousand, I watched out the Chrysler
Bombs strike ya like the Mighty Thor, blast the door
Recite a page like a tidal wave crash the shore
Two pulls, I'm wild like mechanical bulls
Pack a full house, it's girls night out, pull a handful
Heavenly laced, stimulation make it feel slow paced
I motivate and await my sober state


Magnificent, heavenly the God stay bent
Five Percent, Range whipping, Soul Controller of the lynch
Macking phone rings, Stephen King drama down at Danzine
My mood swings, suplexed off the rope, magazine
Coconut juice, walnut colored shoe, ninth annual
Moses lost his sandal hiding the manual
Blowing evangel bugging off of Bon Jovi hits
Grandma Lowvey, famous murder weapon was a trophy
Seeds posing in Osh Kosh, guzzle Grolsch
Sabotage massage rap bandit at large
Wolverine Carnation Milk, Wu denim jeans
Thurston Howell the Third, kid's back on the scene
Call it chopped meat cause every word is choppy
Malachi crunch all crows to death, Kobayashi couldn't stop me
Getting caught up in my world, Hagen-Dazs swirl
Back flip and then a twirl, cave your whole world in



* samples were not cleared for the official album release


Y'know? General, general! Word out...
Yeah...
Aiyyo man.. you poppin fuckers
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


It's just rules with beats - you clown niggas can't rule the streets
We set shop! Wu-Tang, we rule the East
Taking over the block!
"From the gate now!"
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
Aiyyo, it's just rules with beats - you clown niggas can't rule the streets
We set shop! Wu-Tang, we rule the East
Taking over the block, you can't fuck with the block!
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Aiyyo, I stay funky and piley, blue Excelero
They lookin for me, what the fuck you behind me for?
Stressing everything I breathe on
I'm from the boulevard where niggas get jacked and peed on
Whatever homey, we more lavish
I might sneak you in the crib, see my lasers and glasses
Try to get my come up on
Yo, and when you see me, you know I got my "come up" arm on
Cartier called me up, robbery here
We got your seed in the back of the Beemer starving
We like lion killers, catch me on stage with the gauge
In my right hand, grenade and this leather bomber
I scout money, you know we hungry and talk funny
Coughing out corner rappers, don't never walk up on me
I write with only insane Malkovich
My troops gave me money to clown with them, fuck it
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


My first gun was a .32, back before uh!
Graduated to the .38, maybe a nine
I prefer the fo' five, stay alive
Techs held the crack gank in '88
8 oz. straight from Florida, the best temp
Camouflage vest, repping the set
Wu on the east wing, twenty-ten, sexy bad
We up at Spain with that thing thing, my crew strong
We take no search for your party dunn, you know how I run
Spray places, cover faces, beat cases
A big mouth will get your teeth knocked the fuck out
Keep a nunchuk, take money, stay ninja
I injure, any motherfuckin contender
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Hey bitch, your time's up! Go finish them rhymes up
All my soldiers is lined up, my corners is crimed up
Niggas know where to find us, settin the grind up
Police checkin them pies up, my rims are shined up
Wu! We on the rise up, crops supplied up
Plottin niggas demise up, boxed in conduct
Scratch we got 'em sized up, and when the East is in the house
You, you, you, you, you...
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


On the side of the projects, grey skully, bubble 'Lo goose
Mac 11 tucked in front of the belly
Prestigious moves, we killin 'em, hoes we drillin 'em
We like George Foreman out in the streets, we grillin 'em
In the van, .45's and dilly's, ready to slam it
House arrest box is goin off, Tony got grams
Gotta bath tub full of white, lay in it like Sam Montana
Tune 'em out, to blow out, chop 'em like fans
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


This is boulevard hard, lounging in your black car
Camouflage rat guard on "Stomp the Yard"
I-N-S spit monster bars, flip long regards
My click dons bitch, y'all are frauds
I get it in like Tim off the glass
Slamming my name, I'm like the prez, sending men off to blast
What I spit, make 'em spend all their cash
I'm so Wu, so new that I ain't ripped off the tags
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


RZA done birthed us, some curse on purpose
I'm the grouch, my mouth is a circus
Burner plus a good learner, don't need a hood
All I need's a good burner, Nat Turner
Snake rat murderer, all I hear is turf talk
Rack rooms full of goons with bullet wound birthmarks
From the first spark, you heard my response
(Wu-Tang!) More results talkin 'bout whole crew's mission just lost
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Out the beehive, you dip and you dive
But you still can't survive, you can't see past five
Check the outlook, this is not in the book
You bein dragged across the floor while your 'dro in my hook
Lyrical joust, found all the deal off the books
Steve Rif gave the nod to Universal, good look
Still spit poison venom, Red Monkey and Wu dem
Have any dudes seen the condos? It's all 'em
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Put my +clan in da front+, +reunite+ 'em
Make 'em all R.S.V.P., if they want it, we don't invite 'em
No beef, less talk and more action
We parole as a whole, we'll send you back in fractions
Break through fanatic, low crates deep in attics
The Abbott pulled out a .45, looped with static
I scrolled through the menu then rolled to the venue
The dress code is armor all, put a hole up in him
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)




Who in the hell teaches you kung fu?
Your master must be an ignorant idiot as well!


(Uncle Ricky, would you read us a bedtime story?)
Nah kid, but I'mma give you one them old Raekwon crime joints
Feel me? We will, we will
We will, we will -- here we go


Well it was late one night, walking through the park
With my leathered down coat and Wallabee Clarks
Getting my step on, big shit, big six, big wrist
So much excitement in the air, I was crisp
Money suitcase, Louis joint
(yo, Rae, I'mma get some shit just like yours!)
Go make it happen, black God and get rich
Saw the D's fly by, in a New Yorker, yup, tints and shit
They made a right on me, them last two dicks
Know I seen 'em, Max loaded, jog right back to the car
They spun around again and blast their shit
I dropped a Backwood, a puff and then a 6-4-5
You'se a live nigga, you almost smashed your shit
I'mma don my way out the bitch, moving through the car
Nice and slow, two hoodies on and a golden pit
Nigga had a white eye, they both blacked down
What's the clown shit for? The dog jumped in the whip
It was a trained one, wops pointed at me (yo, nigga, freeze)


I told the Chef Raekwon, pump the brakes
Slow it down, you know these C-Cypher Punks scanned your plates
Release the seatbelt off the shoulders, a mile ahead
Then the vibe got a lot colder when the marksman said
"Black niggas in the Jeep, get the fuck out the car"
Put your hands where my eyes can see or suffer a scar"
He was a veteran, who kept, pepper spray in the canister
Donut shop lounger, thirty eight brandisher
On top of that, the blunt smoke just rang a bell
Of his bloodhound who had an acute sense of smell
Beef tripping, saliva dripping from razor sharp teeth
That was pointy as the daggers of the Indian Chiefs
Same cops known for extorting pimps and booking whores
Aimed Glocks at me and Rae, cause they was looking for
A few MCs wanted for a string of break-ins
Last seen, wearing long minks and snakeskins


We will, we will, rob you
We will, we will, Glock you
We will, we will, what? who? (not you)
Here we go


You know my Clan done ran from Japan to Atlanta with stamina
Peace to Chef, Mr. Meth
Move it on your left, with the Iron Lung breath
Ghostface Kill', U-G ill
Deck so real, Dr. Ason Unique, the medic
Ahh, Allah Just, The Abbott, y'all niggas can't forget it
You might catch a Cap if your shit ain't Street
Allah Mathematics make the cypher complete
See knowledge is the foundation of existence
To know starts the spark of the flow
Wisdom activation of the Nation moving
Wise words, show and prove or understand the 13 letters
And the Masta, culture be the way of life
Freedom is reward, who will pay the price for the power
Spending hour after hour, preparing his self
For the hour, now look how refined
When the mind and body is one, every part of me
Supreme equality, manifest the nature of self
G-O-D, now build and add on to the truth
Destroy the bullshit, born incomplete



"I think of sometime" - sample repeated throughout the song


I see him... Killa... blast on 'em, never
Yo..


I got the drop on you, don't flinch
Pop niggas like John Lynch
Leave niggas in they own stench
I'mma light drinker, heavy smoker
Known for duckin' show promoters
Pass the money, over, my whole crew is ex-cons
Be alarmed, when you hear the *err-urrrrr*
It's on, Silverback niggas under the stairs
When we link up, we travel in pairs
Ya'll niggas best to beware of the most thoroughest
Cover all aspects, four corners
You can't creep up on us
I'm takin' one for the team, deal me in
And when the smoke clears, do it again
This ain't a side show, you can die slow
There's no I in team, we all ride... yo!
The Masta brought the ceremony, this is my testament
Homicide Housing, that's what I represent


Criminal gun play, chemical dream to P.J.'s
Last raid, another fed paid, bed rum: Sunday
The world dyin' for the love of money
Expensive chains, intensive pain from that cocaine
Condition the brain, children in strain, as I look back
Memory lane, civil and plain, it be in fame
A major part of the game, chemistry grain
Foolish kids ran when I came
Forty acres, five percent of terrain
Spark right through my vein tunnel, aim through this jungle of rain
A lot of haters wanna see us hang
But watch me bang as in Eagle/Crane
Step back, shatter your frame
Another victim in the system where he barely sustained
Forkin' in, I sold a million way, his first campaign
Sippin' rosemary cherry champagne, nigga
The young and the dangerous, water on the wrist, ice cryst'
Talk with a lisp, then I be top of your list


We all in this together, forever and ever
Down for whatever, whenever, yeah, yeah
We all in this together, forever and ever
Down for whatever, whenever


Check the Words from the Genius, that was written in pen
Murder gloves, hide the fingerprint, but never the sin
Ghetto prophet that's born to quote
Got the crimies, behind me, with the face on scope
Don't provoke, trust son, that thing bust, and we roll dangerous
Who can handle us, when we rush the clubs on thrust
Yo, don't miss the lead vocalist, terrorist
Wu-Tang, a pure danger, the God hold a fort
Teach law, universal, beatdown, my stomping ground
We hold courts in the streets of New York
Snort the gun powder, eyes stay red like fire
Cut the mic wire, hit a love ballad note
Pen stroke, beautiful quote, for you to deep throat
Ghetto life had to rough up in the housing
They only make 'em like us, every twenty five thousand






What you see, ah, you ain't seen nothing yet
Ah, you ain't seen nothing yet, ah, you ain't seen nothing yet
I thought told you


What you see is what you get
And you don't see and don't respect
You must be blind and can't detect
That I am from that BK set
Where Bible men flex big chains round necks
Wet late night sex, big dice game vets
Sweat, no threat, north, south, east, west, Weed gun men bet
Then all run it down, it's all good, I thought I told you
Any mother step in the square, I bet I fold you
Rhyming on timing, I shine like I'm suppose to
Nothing come close to son, it don't suppose to son
I thought I told you




Get funky like Lucy on the bass guitar
Make the ladies wanna drop they pants, lose they bra
I guess it just comes with the life of a star
Fly jets out of air force base, down in Shaw
I know you never heard it like this before
Real slick when he talk, the East New York walk
We can Iron Mic spar, ten paces then draw
Raw 'caine, straight from the grain, the royal Lion King
Keep it raw, hit the floor, heavyweight word
Break a man jaw on the floor, that's what you pay for
Sold eyes towards the broad, and like the mic strike
Thunder like the hammer of Thor, and keep it rough, sun



 + (samples)
(Make me yours) He get out of line, break his fucking arm...
You know how it go (What am I supposed to say? Yeeaaah)
You know, word up, not playing the games, with these niggas, man
(Somebody tell me what do I do...)
None at all, man... hit 'em off, none of that, man


Aiyo, jump out the Acura, crazy heavy, what's popping?
Us locking the game, word to every hand on the locman
Street gwop, everybody eats, sweep blocks
This is a message, ain't go no grams, we gon' beatbox
Study like lessons, niggas in the game biting the grain
You knowing where it came from, stop it
You thought we wasn't coming? You dumbing, you blunted again
Watch Lex get that dough out ya pocket, rhyme all 'pallegic
Can't nothing move when I rhyme, when I drop lines it's law out in Egypt
Love ups, don't need no batteries now, what?
The only niggas that'll glow'll be us
Yo, throw me in Sin City, leave me with the vultures and bats
Then give me two weeks to bubble like Kim titties
Dirt Dog, we miss you, now it's time to murder the game
Cuz if things change, you know it ain't against Wu


What am I supposed to say? Yeeaaah
Somebody tell me what do I do...


We keep it hot, keep the heat on the block
We never stop, drawing water up until it begin to drop
Raining with the patchwork of puzzles
That was written in the year of the dragon
More raw than you could ever imagine
How much of a great blessing to a rap city
Where the youth is organically fed, from the Witty
Unpredictable, Talent And Natural Game is lyrical
Analyze the picture, the portrait, the visual
A Cuban Link Chef cooks spaghetti that's untied
RAGU nigga whose tomatoes are sundried
He gave y'all niggas whiplash from bling bling
But my rhyme'll give ya hot flash and moodswings
Math shed light on divine secrets, then science leaked it
For the lower level creatures that can't peep it
I observe MC's, regardless
From a neighboring world which is ten times the sharpness...




Let the track wind and ya mind flow free
Remain conscious on this ride to ya best ability
Infinity, back to the source of which it came
Energy, see it change forms, atoms being born, never ending
On and on and on and, travel with me
Not trying to convince the pack, that it's a fact
For those who can't adapt, I lived it, shitted it back
We have agreed, you'll feel the impact of the truth when I'll squeeze
The brain feels something pop, hip hop, locked in texts
Fat checks, fly whips, jewelry, chicks
Enough kicks, fitted crown, buttoned down
Underneath the white T lies the four pound
This is forty-five minutes of menacing
Dismantling, any MC opponent stepping in the zone
Get ya face blown (Get ya face blown)




Observe the word, when I speak, get the truth's heard
True to the curb, Wu classic is the new birth
Spreading the blessing across seven continents
Arm of the trench, there's no form of defense
Entertainment, nine swords swing rapid
Check the techniques, first bow to The Abbott
Witty Unpredictable, gritty individual
Valid, if it's Actual, Talent and it's Natural
Game, rugged like the train, pump it in ya vein
I and I ride or die under the name
W-U, the primary, ya secondary
Definitely not necessary, the legendary
You printed the blueprints to do this shit
Moving the youth in the bricks
Spit poison tipped darts that rip hearts
Through the chest, when I manifest my sick art


Speaking my mind, fall in line when I spit mine
Still in my prime, still'll shine til it quit time
If this is a crime, find me guilty, I'm so sublime
So rapid with rhymes, sayin' I'm slacking is assonine
Revealing the truth, catching feelings, it's still the Wu
Gorilla the booth, body armored, them killa proof
In living proof, I'm the Wittiest Unpredictable
Most Talented rap muthafucker you ever listened to


I'm a hustler, I grind til my pack is done
Give a seed mad knowledge til they crack and run
Can't nobody fuck with me, I'm just too nice
Smack niggas in they head everytime I write
Yo, I'm straight from Park Hill where the guns is popping
Where them little black kids do they grocery shopping
Go to school fucked up, it's Africa Island
We poor in the bricks but inside it's nothing but talent




It's on 
(RZArector)


Yes the shit is raw coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, "Wu-Tang's back for more"
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)


This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
X Y  slam Nine Diagram pole
Raekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback Notre Dame
Golden Arms is bronze Buddha palm hit Qu'ran
It blows extreme, mainstream be the theme, supreme team
America's Cream Team, redeemed
Vidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone
Gun POW to the dome and split the bone
Wig blown off the ledge by the alleged
Full-fledged, sledge RZA edge
One dose of my feroc' handheld trigger cuts
A capella spitting shell paralyse if you get touched
And critical mic cords, hanging like umbilical
Cords, dope swords, five star general
Raw be the quote rap style sore throat
Through the fully operational, handheld totem




A hundred thousand times one, snatch up my styles get done
I hold a title, and here's how my belt was won, check it
Slick majestic, broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew through lack of effort
You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes
My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
Masked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords
And his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines
With more gains than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains
Poisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this
You get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this
Side effects of hot raps and hot tracks
A duffel bag full of guns son, dipped in black
My culture, glides and attacks you like a vulture
Ghostface in Madison Square is on your poster




Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy show it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
Of the Wu and learnt how to
Fuck up your anatomy steadily, calm and deadly
Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit
MCs submit to the will as I kill your
Juvenile freestyle, civilize the mental
Devils worship this like an icon
Bear-hugging mics with the grips of a python




You heard other raps before but kept waiting
For the Son of Song, I keep dancehalls strong
Beats never worthy of my cause, I prolong
Extravaganza, time sits still
No propaganda, be wary of the skill
As I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum
Dedicated to rap nigga, beware of the fearsome
Lebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat
CD massacre, murder to cassette
I blow the shop up, you ain't seen nothing yet
One man ran, tryna get away from it
Put your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh
Into your chamber like Freddy enter dream
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause, like a black jack to dat
You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertaining motherfuckers can't stop O
In battling, you don't want me to start tattling
All up on the stage cause y'all snakes keep rattling
Bitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you wanna clock me like Sherry
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry
Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in, and get ten dollars back
The fat LP with Cappachino on the wax
Pass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LPs back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt and dial 9-1-7
1-6-0-4-9-3-11
And you could get long dick hip-hop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction
I'm Staten Island best son, fuck what you heard
Niggas still talking that shit is absurd
My repertoire, is U.S.S.R
P.L.O. style got thrown out the car
And ran over by the Method Man Jeep
Divine can't define my style is so deep
Like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy
Like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind
Cause you weak in the knees like SWV
Tryna get a title like Wu Killa Bee
Kid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbott
Me and RZA rhyme name printed in the tablet
Under vets, we paid our debts for mad years
Hibernate the sound and now we out like bears
In Born Power, born physically, power speaking
The truth in the song be the pro-black teaching



I think the jewel that the brother 2Pac was dropping
Was uh "Keep your head up"
He was right on with that one, he was right on, right on
Supreme wisdom, the motion in which one moves
It's like, it's like words that are wise that make the people groove
Substance, the material of integrity, that builds strength
Now huh, see soul is the source of universal love
It's the DNA of the world
It's what makes the world go around
Now, now those that have it, may feel the sense of being complete
Those without it, are in search of what's missing
See how can I forget, the poverty, the projects
The lack of opportunity, the injustice
Aww man, they're seeing through the lies of politicians
False promises, selling us religion, poisonous injections
These superstitious believes, we teach our children to eat
The wrong foods, mentally and physically
Now if I told ya'll the truth
The opportunities are slim
Living conditions are grim
Our youth's future seems dim
Infested communities, drugs destroyed many families
Children left alone, separated broken homes
It's like they're victims of modern day lynchings
You know, huh the system stopping us to frisk
Handcuffing our wrist, like they trapping us all
In hopes of sending us up north
Crunching on the jail bars, thinking of escape
Waiting on release date, man yeah
To all the youths of today we got to find a better way
For real this is simply Jamel Irief




The fox, is kinda foxy, Mr. Wolf he's the guy
Who chased Red through the woods and ate Grandma
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
Unlike the wolf, who made a widower of Grandpa


Yo, must I flex my cash, to sex yo' ass
I wet the Ave. when I set my path
The 'Vette don't crash, I'm built to long last
Grab my money clip, I hit the bong fast
Earn my respect, my checks they better cash
Finger on the trigger with my nigga Fred Glass
Knuckles is brass, start snuffin you fast
Jumpin outta cabs, grabbin money bags
Next shot go right through your hovercraft
You do the math my acid tongue slash
When will you learn it's return of Shaft
The genuine thriller, the Miller Draft
My force might blur, the Porsche'll purr
The apple martini, of course it's stirred
I'll do the honor,  the Shaolin bomber
Shark skin armor, I'll bring the drama




Damn, defecatin' on the map
Wu-Tang takin it back, no fakin in the rap
How real is that, cause niggas hatin on the fact
That the kid is blazin this track and hatin on 'em back
My dough's stacked up with O's, who the mack
Duckin po'-po's blowin smoke O's in the 'Llac
To be exact, don't want no hassle with the stack
In the Big Apple, we the rotten apples in the back
Yeah, it's all grillin, how the fuck y'all feelin?
Non-stop park killin, on the block we was killin 'em
The arch villans, when the blood start spillin
Any stuck start squealin, body bags we was fillin 'em
Yeah, now I got it in the smash
Ounce of marijuana and a llama in the dash
Me and my comrades followin the cash
And livin e'ry day like tomorrow is the last




I'm like the St. Bernard to ya baby when you're lost out in the snow
Like a coyote out on the desert...
Where the foxes never go
And the wolf, they never go...


Yo, would you recognize a jewel for what it is when you see it
Or would you take it for somethin else and get to' the fuck up
Men come together for the common cause
To beat yo' ass, just because
There's a line you don't cross offendin the boss
While of course his one selectin through your head shot
I'm back in the yard again, the bars callin
15 sets of this will have you swollen
Ladies like, "Damn papa you lookin right
I'd love to give you some of this pussy and I'm a dyke"
I write when the energy's right to spark friction
DJ cuttin it, spinnin it back mixin
Great pop knock tickin, poetry description
For the motion picture reenactment
Activate a hired assassin, keep it classic
Rap evolution every black, yo pass that








Yo, too advanced, Digi' stance, made the CD enhanced
I move with the speed and strength of ants
Identical in form with the Bees they swarm
Hold up, the cold current appear warm
My first verbal brawl, started on some yes yes y'all
To the beat y'all, break your windshield, your jeep stall
Mr. Traffic, dumbin shit, from ecclesiastic
Cashier, holdin out, fine, cut off the plastic
See the logo? A monument in hip-hop
Carved out, in the giant landscape of broken rocks
Whether heard in herb spots, jukebox or malt shops
Uncut live, drop eighty-five, in one shot
Spotlight hits the metal mic, majority stare
Heard the Wu snare, while my iris cut down the glare
Walk a road the great length you find too long to measure
My Clan'll make me rhyme like D. Banner under pressure
No surprise, double disc touched five
Those elements kept environments colonized
With the high flying death-defying flow like the Rebel
Right there, but you're one light year from my level


Uh-huh.. yeah.. yo.. check it.. yo..
Bottles goin' off in the church, we broke the wine
Slapped the pastor, didn't know Pop had asthma
He pulled out his blue bible, change fell out his coat
Three condoms, two dice, one bag of dope
Oooh! Rev. ain't right, his church ain't right
Deacon is a pimp, tell by his ice
Mrs. Parks said, "Brother Starks, meet you at the numbers spot
Heard you got red tops out, and I want a lot"
Shirley fainted dead on the spot
Two ushers slipped eighty dollars right out the pot
Oh shit!


Egyptian, brown skin brown suede Timbs
Masqueradin X-rated throw blades, all occasions
Round nozzle touchdown, Haagen-Daas gobbles White House
Gucci flag on the roof, call us rock groups
Mere intelligent, buy Neimann Marcus out
No doubt, all we saw he bought, Lori mom's all blow
Was simple, blamp instrumentals run camps the stamps get you
The way we lamp, fans come and get you
Play, fullback strapped like a fuck, war at
The black, Carlo Gambino's stash house in Hackensack
Pack capsules, Green Bay 'em lay 'em down like wax do
It's all actual we build, like Crash Crew
Coconut, incense, one sentence, aiyyo
Control the holy flinch hit this, new whips
Roman numerals, sun splash them niggas like, Tango and Cash
Alcatraz cats roll out fast..


Wu thousand nuthin but hardcore
We tryin to get land riches and more
Ghost put me on to it
We just do it, floss or whatever
Take care of the business, there's too many roughnecks
Give two of these to Flex, tell him it's real rap like Ghost
Had to beat niggas with toast
Clubs V.I. clientele we lay it down flat
Pulled out on y'all kid, now where your mans at?
Fakin the real like, "Damn I can't stand Cappa'"
Then my wardrobe flooded the next chapter
Y'all heard about us like we heard about you
Bless the mic with reality, hit you with the virtue
Calm down not tryin to hurt you, burst through
That shit, fatter than all y'all niggas outfits
We the glitch like Y2K
Catch the ball when it drop, guns pop, y'all have a nice day

"Doctor Kanabuta, Iron Man, he is invincible
His remarkable armor is supreme!"


Yo, sometimes I'm liable to spaz and break fool
Grab my gun, select one, snatch son
Put the barrel by his face, blast one by his eardrum
Piss run, you drop thinkin you shot
Screamin like a bitch, kicks to your face
Shots to the body that shake like the bass
I'm Ghostfaced up, military style down
Nuff ammunitions of rounds across the chest


Skip to the intro, rap through po'
Smashed a fresh ball of wax ceasar
Flashy penthouse that overlooks the vista
Wally Moc' half tied, swimmin trunks
Three chunks of ice sit in Johnny Walker for advice
Catch the moment, fundraiser at will, work with the homeless
Polish diamond edge, Flintstone shit, sealed in a comb pick
Carefully, swing the B seven series Christmas lights
Too bright Ghost is comin y'all fix the mirrors
Relax like pudding, confidence strangle my man couldn't
Exile he no longer in the hood
Bless the kid that max the most
Me I turn a wedding into hoax
Roses tied to bombs on posts
On commercial breaks, piss in the apple juice
Rasta nigga rock the big do's
Jiffy Pop it's only chant Wu




"What we're gonna do right here is go back, way back, back into time"
"Here we go!"
"OK everybody!"
"Sing my song" "Step up to this" (Both X4)

 Represent for my peoples
 Tony Starks!
 Universal frontier
 Original bloodclat bad boys
 Check it out boy


Who come to get you, none, they want guns
I be the first to set off shit, last to run
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother Son cause he shine like one


Scriptures hit the body like sawed-off shotties
Like my hair knotty and my nosepiece snotty
Fuck a nigga hottie, that ho pussy probably
Burn like the deserts of Mogabi, for real
Ain't nothing fraudulent here, we pioneer
Commandeer a new frontier, this be the Wu yeah
36 Chambers of fear, huh you lost it
Information leaking out your faucets, hmm
Time to forfeit your crown and leave the grounds
There's a new sheriff in town holding it down
It's the two holster, shit shot smoker
Wanted dead or alive, bounty on the poster
Wild in the West, a student of my culture
And life is the test, hold up
Let a nigga catch his breath
I'm still paying dues and the last one is death
Back to the essence with that shit you stressing, this rap profession
Now peep Tical, the son of the Shaolin Isle
Bless my style, criminology pays
The last times and days, Johnny fucking Blaze


This goes for niggas who know
Wu will blow like yayo, lay low
Plus cooling in Barbados
Ricans be giving me much shit to touch shit
Stay cool Papa, see you with enough shit
Back at the lab a, crack's bagged up
Yo niggas act up, what blow up their workers if they have to
Seoritas, fucking up a storm buying Gods margaritas
Sucking his dick, up in the whip long
Designed for rhyme crime nigga jail time jiggas
Them niggas up in hype Vigors lighting niggas
Silks Wally wear Figaro chain yeah
Jakes beware of black rap millionaires
Rock Airs, leather goose, bears blowing this year
1-800-GAMBINO niggas, yeah


Wu roll together as one, I call my brother Sun cause he shine like one


Solid gold crown is shining, we're blinding like some diamonds
I'm reclining in the sky on a cloud with silver lining
Double breasted, bullet proof vested, well protected
The heart, the rib cage, the chest and solar plexus
Casting stones, cracking two-hundred and six bones
And watch your ass get blown to a sea of fire and brimstone
How dare you approach it with them poems
The overfiend like noah bean green souls with a soldier mean
The grand exquisite imperial wizard or is it
The Rzarector come to pay your ass a visit
Local bio-chemical, universal giant, the black general
Licking shots at Davy Crockett on the bicentennial
Happy Millennium two thousand
Microchips, two shots of penicillin goes up your Adrenalin
Son it's time for bouting
It's a model you're resembling the niggas who like following
Trapped inside your projects like a genie inside the bottle and


God stepping forth upon holy ground of the track
It's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like I'm under attack
So I decided to bite down on the mic
So the pain of the track won't deny the fact that I'm the master
For what lurks, is an expert that hurts
The individual who tries to visualize under
Cause I strike, like thunder
Niggas couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable
My wisdom fucks up your respiratorial
Systems are fractured by the killer tactics
Style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged
Enter the entity, my vicinity
Is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity
Represent the school of hard knocks and Glocks my
Clan is hostile and got mad moss for blocks so
Feel the force of impact from the iron side of
The gat as I attack the track
From the blind side of the pack, Starks pass the chrome
Watch a nigga get blown out his motherfucking dome-piece
Deceased, laid to rest


Who come to get you, none, they want guns
I be the first to set off shit, last to run
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother Son cause he shine like one


Yo, aiyyo I got this under my wing, move give me room
Holding up your saloon, clean sweep, like a broom
Full moons make me howl like a wolf out of breath
Sold only new vocal cords you heard Genius on Gef
So step back, to the lab at, high velocity
My team make hand-to-hand sales, we're like a pharmacy
Fuck Geraldo, Pablo's plan bro is Bravo
Goodfellas we know, best sellers become novels
The man rocking head bands, silk scarves and jams
Early 80's British Walkers, playboys, mocks and shams
The laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies
Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's
Remember them kids that came off with eight million
Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavilions
Them flour heads must have been stupid
Tell me how the fuck black niggas get caught with all that loot kid
There's jet money, underground money
Submarines and rings too bad you fucked up dummies




My seeds grow and his seeds marry his seeds
My seeds grow and his seeds marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang forever, baby


It's good to see the Wu-Tang family under one roof
We celebrate, toastin' shots, Ciroc 40 proof
Burgers on the grill and fried fish
The wiz made potato salad, greens for a side dish
Cold water, mill and reminisce with cousins and sisters
Children on the grass playin' ball and Twister
Fresh lemonade is made, we playin' spades
My nephews turn the livin' room into an arcade
Aunt's cherry baked pie, surprise, Johnny showed up
You can tell from the smell in the air, somethin' rolled up
It's love, peace and happiness, with the joy and laughter
Camera phones flashes, the moment is captured


It's so nice to see all the folks you love together
Sittin' and talkin' 'bout all the things that's been goin' down


It's goin' down
We rock all in together now, Wu-Tang forever now
Twenty years later we still bang whatever now
Turn change to cheddar
If I could take a quote from Obama, change is better
I vow to never let you down
Remember Meth Tical?
In my circle haters was never 'round
I'm a boss, owe that to Kevin Lile
Reunited, the whole world excited
Wu-Tang is for the kids and people and girls invited


Family reunion
Got to have a family reunion
Family reunion
It's so nice to come together
To get together
I wish grandma could see
The whole family
I sure miss her face
And her warm and tender embrace


I miss my grandmother, my auntie and Unique Ason
I knew Dirt was high when he had that face on
Fangs hangin' out his mouth, his fronts was golden
Wildin', record execs can't control him
He said ish like me and Mariah
Hit me, woah-woah-woah, that's fire
Still no matter what we gon' rep the name
Look at your family, we got twenty years in the game


A family reunion
Gonna have a family reunion ooh, ooh
Family reunion
It's so nice to come together
To get together


Aye yo
I'd like to make a toast to my Wu-Tang family
All over the globe
East coast, west coast
All my brothas in the hood keepin' it good
Peace to the Gods and Earths
All my Latino brothers
My Asian brothers, my Caucasian brothers
Wu-Tang Forever




Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

Wu-Tang, nigga, Crash Ya Crew , laugh at you
You bastard, you, pass through, slap an ass or two
Hear me roar, Timbaland tree, weed galore
MC's with gusto y'all ain't neva seen befo'
El-Producto, pass that, ya puff too slow
That's what's up, yo, the kid with the buck-toothed flow
Oh, that's Meth Man, southpaw, I throw my left hand
To that hardcore shit that even make the Tec jam
Oh my goodness! Trust me, ain't nuttin' like some hood shit
Gotta love my dogs but ain't nuttin' like a good bitch
Strictly, if I'm goin' down, she comin' wit me
Whole time screamin', "Oh my God!", ain't no mystery


Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, you either step or get stepped upon
Correct me if I'm wrong but fake thugs never last long
Can't wait until ya fake ass gone
Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, you either step or get stepped upon
Nigga, uh-oh! I think they're playin' our song
Lit blunts, Clan in the front, sayin' "It's on!"


Try to Wu hate, duck, you could suck my
Watch the block get clear when I buck my
Boomerang darts, you can't duck my
No tellin' which Clan man you got struck by
Chains get tucked when he walk by, hawk eye
Arrows bein' fired from crossbow, I talk fly
You can't Etcha-sketch all my rhyme threat
Try to bite my flow, you catch ya throat strep
Soaked in cess, dope, you eat the cold Tec's
Bold flex, W crown, the ice O-X
Up in the oolie, yo, who you know?
John Bizzi, Ghost Deini, Rollie Finger and them toolies yo
Stainless Bobby, boy, you have an English folly
To try to detain the slang that we can to polly
Plus you didn't peep Irief, kid, you sleep
I seen this heap of shit, you in steep




Yo, amist the gravel, play the words of the Big Apple
Broadcastin' live from the pits of the battle
Wigs split and rattled, get shook out ya saddle
You ever hear me losin', one of y'all fix the panel
Ask who? Wu, that's true, known piranhas
Who knows drama, fathers of your whole persona
The mad doctor, stay locked in the O-R
In too deep, beyond reach of the sonar
Still a vet, say my name next to hall of fame
Hurtin' third string players, first day in the game
It's on, son, the Killa Bee swarm come
Make the world shake with one continuous drum




Wave ya gun, Killa (I got you)
Shoot this nigga in his face fast, mumblin' (I heard y'all forgot Wu)
Wear ya crown, black down (Watch the block too)
Blow at y'all niggas (Blowin' at the cops too)
Eh-yo, my wallets stay bulletproofs, racin' in Coups, yea we the realest
Ultraviolet leathers on, pealin' this, love lookin' the illest
Gorilla things, monster background with a history
You're pumpin' crack, yap clowns, we all real in here
Strap a bomb on a family member, let y'all niggas know we here
Blasted, it's like cheeba when I splashed it
Real reefer heads'll know the meanin' of hittin' glass
I told y'alls, against y'all, Ginsengs, avenge Gods
Picture me stabbin' you in the yard for R's
Kid saw Staten, nine Bin Ladens
Valors on, colorful draws, lookin' all relaxed in


Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, You either step or get stepped upon
Correct me if I'm wrong but fake thugs never last long
Can't wait until ya fake ass gone
Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, You either step or get stepped upon
Nigga, uh-oh! I think they're playin' our song
Lit blunts, Clan in the front, sayin' "It's on!"
