I live life lavish and my chain is karats
The last name on the train to Paris
Used to be lame then attained the merit
So many clothes can't name the fabrics
Dynamics, I want the fame
And my name engraved in granites
Here's his lane, now came to grab it
You moving sideways, change your habits
Used to rock minks, then I changed to rabbit
From out the garbage, I came from average
Used to be righteous that changed to savage
Bang my ratchet like Bangkok Dangerous
36 Chamber fist Trianglist
Watch me mangle this Star Spanglist
Rock cowboy Wrangler creating mega-hits
I'm from the grain Game at my fingertips


Yeah! Killa Hill lay it down!
Killa Bees on the swarm!
Nigga


Ayyo I plow down ? like I'm out for revenge
Fuck it, it seems like the drama never ends
Be in the projects like I never left out
Might be on Osgood, see a nigga stretched out
I can't take it seems like my hood is cursed
Bad niggas, I thought that the good was first
My old whore, she march with a foul parade
Don't learn shit til another child is sprayed
I'm out here, fuck it, like I live on ? and Rico
Keep a low cut like Margie
I don't give a fuck, y'all made me bitter
I'ma whip your kids out like a babysitter
I'ma grown man but I'm young in the mind state
Live in every borough but New York my tri-state
Test me you know I brought a bitch on the tour bus
Pour piss on you, leave you stuck for 4 months
My head fucked up, I'm off my clean streak
Don't make me pick the 9's up, I come from mean streets
My unit snitched on me, ratted me out
They all ganged up on me, tried to take my mouth
However the cause I'm in jail and get bent
They cut from dirty cloth, I'm cut from cement
Original , got the crazy glow
Them devils tried to jump me, I'm crazy though
Absolut Vodka rat crush mad Goose
O.G. all day like I be on the deuce
Pop off with it, get your army in order
Staten Africa, Islam, across that water


Yeah
Told 'em "Have Gun--Will travel"
Blowing earth metals, black son spill gravel
Bronze Man oblong javelins in my cabinet
Detroit cement salutations from the missile plant
Quick to the hollowpoint, it ain't no olive branch
My low-cal 4 0 cal. in the cardigan
Tempted by Satan put a bullet in his diaphragm
Walk around black clouds and quiet violins
A tire fire blends poet and violent pens
Illest skill, got steel plots and iron winds
Uphill need a ghetto spill, the sirens sing
Street dreams. black season, inspired kings
For fire water veins, still rain Listerine
They chains through to my "Roots", no doubt Ben Verne
On the road to riches and diamond speech
I might turn a bag of white sand in mountain peaks


I don't text to send messages
My testosterone stimulate her estrogen
Whether Black, Caucasian or the Mexican
Asian, she get the message and she coming back for sex again
Organic drugs
My natural persuasion
You under the influence of 36 invasion
Spider-man amazing but I'm darker then Parker
Skin got abrasions from Arya and Tasha
Sliding down the street cold
Pull up to your party stimulated with a Jeep full
Of jerry gap honeys and bottles of vodka
Plus the weed rolls, here we go
Mediating, never jealous, over zealous
Wu Tang's my fellowship
Fans mash up accapellas of our lyrics with Beatle tracks embellishes
The idea clearly that Wu-Tang forever
This way of life is art, rhymes and cleverness
Joined by God no man can sever this
I complete jobs free and effortless
Use tiger crane, snake style plus the leopard fist




We will fight till the night is done
We will live our lives tonight as one
We will live our lives tonight as one, one


I'm a bad mother, shut your mouth
Insanity, DVD, how I stretch 'em out
What the stress about? INS best out
Fact, you knew that before he left the house
Fresh at the produce section
Gaze at my shine like a showroom necklace
Death wish, stepping in Deck's direction
I'm checking niggas like test questions


Across 110th now, cross Belmont and Montauk
Camera hawk hawks the sidewalk
When they get to flexing muscle niggas bust you
Hustlers do you, gave you your first toolie
Cutting out of school to pump your first loose leaf
Think graduate to wait, take it out of state, duct tape
Anything of pulse and heroin
Emcees frozen, cuban link chains are golden
I'm ownin' everywhere I'm holdin' it up, to keep it raw
Math here, I got 'em keep coming back for more


Yo, man, I'm so turned up, all the marijuana burned up
Y'all don't want the drama, word up
The Wu first up, the game is the world versus us
Y'all was good 'til the world heard us
Y'all ain't want them Clan birds up
Y'all don't want your man served up, that'll get the fans worked up
Homie really wanna play, stir it up
I'mma catch me a wave, surfs up
Gliding on the track like this, make me wanna act like this
Make me wanna smack that trick
Make a killer really wanna yap that kid
If he opens up his yap that's it




Mass of minerals in a glass house
Playing 4th the Wu neutrinos will blast out
Letting out verbal thunder bolts
Until the world attract old and younger folks
Charge with the vitality of magnetism
In large reality with massive rhythm
The manual without technical part
From the beginning give off an electrical spark


I respect you if you respect me
Everything's for real, WTC
No fake ass shit, don't front the Remy
Break bread, never have pockets empty
Let's get it, flip it up then we can spend it
The money train, Killa Beez on your brain
W's everywhere, one on your chain
Homeboys for life, please don't change
You can hide at my house, it ain't no thing
If you see the pigs, don't say jack
Call me original, don't say cap
I'm on the low, might be at the murder
Holding off the place y'all cats never heard of
Yeah, chicks wanna peep me out
Nasty ass, want me to pee in their mouth
But now I'm out, about to link with sticks




Bang a few notes up top, we call it beast mode
Forget the street codes, show you like a deep throat
It gets rougher, you suffer from the heat stroke
Blast barrels, embrace my leaf smoke
Park Hillians radio for back up
Polish your act up, nigga need a back up
Syrup in my cup, no cut, straight up
UG's on the court, never miss a lay up


When the emcees came to live out their names
Some rode the bus, some rode the train
Some motherfuckers wish they never came
When they met the nine swordsmen of Wu-Tang
Nine Maseratis pulls up to this party hard
Body, the party is filled with Godbody
There out of shape models coming through with those bottles
And double D's please, all eyes follow
Pass me a bucket of ice, that's nice
Hit with the vodka, what you say proper
I drink with the copper, show up in a chopper
Stop her, she wanna have a mnage  trois
I can tell by the bra, RZA Ra-KZA-Keem is all is Allah
Do you wish or wish upon a star? Do you wish or wish upon a star?






Bob Digi, U G.O.D, Raekwon the Chef, the Inspectah Deck
M.E.T.H.O.D., the B.O.B.B.,
Straight up, Masta Killa, the GZA/The Genius
It's the Ol' d-d-d- d-d-d- d-d-Dirty Bastard!

 Ya know what I mean?
 GHOST-FACE KILLAH!
 Lemme give y'all the bullshit hook for y'all niggas
Check it out...


The burners and the stash, we 'bout the cash
We got females that got it like that
The golden childs that bone the crowd
See, niggas in the place that bit my style
Well, I'm a singer, dancer, we bulletproof brothers
Wu-Tang got the answer
Cause if I had a chance to do it again
I will still keep the heat in my pants-uh


Y'all be nice to the crackheads, everybody listen up
I shot one of my bitches, the ho ain't trick enough
Word life to big screen Don, tapping dustbones out
With starwriters like I fucked Celine Dion
Stuck everything that's the god's honest beyond
We airin' niggas out, that's the type shit that we on
Official Wu-Tang headbanger
Flood your space with big waves like you did in Sri Lanka


I drink heavy gallons of cru, play the big part
Niggas got squid on the grill, selling kids Clarks
Finesse notes, yo, the Guess on with the vest pose
Yellow swede one matching hat with the grey gun
Niggas be rhymin' for nothing, then my team pull up
We all throw down y'all broke niggas stay frontin'
Lines come digital stupid, plus ain't got no jewelry on
Bet I'm still live and I'm coopin'
Two of my silverbacks run through a pack of your wolves
Front on react, we're sippin' Cognac  relax dude
Know I'm with these cracks dude


Yo, 1-2, Dirt McGirt
Solid tone smith with 6th shots, lick shots
Leave your head like a Shaolin monk with 6 dots
Brooklyn Zoo, Zoo
Brooklyn Zoo


It's the return of Bin Laden, grab your armor
Smash pretty boy niggas, crush their karma
Eat bones with alligators, roll deep with my entourage
My whole crew's fresh out the bars
Diggler AKA the Cab Driver
Drop him off in the middle of fire
Dirty Island, drag bodies to the Murderland
Knock niggas out hurtin' my hand


I remember in the elevator we was playin' corners
Now we play the corners and the cops is stayin' on us
Staten's where the war is
Where the court system's running out of warrants
Where TNT be jumping out the Taurus
For real I can't call it
You see I love Lucy cause she Lawless
Exactly like that 1-0-3-0-4 is
Snitch niggas swallow your tongue
Already know the island I'm from
And y'all don't want no problems with them


We got a history full of lightning victories
Conceptual breakthrough, it ain't no mystery
Long vision from giants in every way
Rap czars, magnificent flows for every day
From the East to the 'ville, from the West to the hills
Incredible rhymes, encouraging skills
From rat packs, the smallest crews were enormous
We hit 'em fast with an effortless performance
MCs start fleeing in flocks
Especially those that's more sensitive to heat and shock


We grindin' down to the bone, my name grounded in stone
I'm Mr. Violence we loungin' with chrome
Mr. Violence we lounge in his home, hit the housing on Rome
Shining like a hundred thousand in stones
Move mountains with poems, got a jones for dinero
1-6-zero my songs we throwin' elbows
The hoes cling, sho thing, we know kings
Only dime dikes with minds right, we choose Queens


Yeah, we wild like rockstars who smash guitars
Yo son split his face with the toast, he ain't ghost
It's no joke iron coat rifle with the stroke
One toke brains float, shot to the throat
Before the smoke hit, witness the killing, chilling crime scene
Body on the block, eyes open from the shock
Of being popped in the neck
Yet he still held a lit cigarette between his fingers
Danger when you step into the chamber with the Masta
Disaster, gotta blast ya cause I have to


The rat pack is back from the island of Stat'
Leave you cursed dust, cause you worship the Gat
The first one to snap drunk off the Smirnoff
Blow the bouncer's ear off, let him floss he the boss
Handcuffed, to the turntables like Wizard Theodore
See it's pure, let it rain pearly ounces
Bang him with the thing that hang from the trousers
You don't want no drama, I'm flaming fast
That nigga jumped up and did the Damon Dash




Yo, this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
For all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it

Yo, in the housing, thousands seen early graves
Victims of worldly ways, memories stays engraved
All my live brothers, is locked down with high numbers
The young hunger, blind to these lies, they die younger
In this New World the Order slaughter men, women, and children
Ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in
The projects, lifeless like a vietnam vet
Constant war, sever threats of enemy conquest
Crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble
Streets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble
Vivid thoughts, Devils resort to trick knowledge
They kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars
I know the pain the game bring, I did the same thing
Spaced out in the staircase, performing a sting
It's hard to keep control, I bless those who seek a scroll
Trying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
Not a role model, I walk a hard road to follow
I sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
The gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole
Mentally they fold, and they eventually sold
Their life and times, deadly like the virus design
But too, minute to dilute, the scientist mind


You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way


A voice cries from the wilderness of the North
A representation of the families that lost one
All victims of incarceration
Or other divisions of the family structure
Youths are injected with serums that leads
To skin irritations, babies being born with
Disfigurations, experimentations
On their faces there bear worry-ations
Of mothers that carry the pain
Of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
Fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
It lightly begins to rain screams of terror
Are hidden by the passing trains
This can't be little Hussein, his uncle cried
As he drops to his nephew's side, holding his cane
Just give me a name, of who has inflicted this
Bitter sickness, and left us to witness


Yeah, yo
Curses from war, innocent blood spills for days
Soothe in godly ways, hands, solemn in praise
Tree of life, more precious than rubies, golden game
The wise shall flourish inherit, Halls of Fame
Crime visions in my blood got me, locked in prison
While we die hard living people whine about religion, vision
Blow, spin, and sin and killing what's revealing
It's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen
Zero process, progress, become the hunted
America's most wanted, good life flaunted, want it
Some love the speed, some satisfy a need
Some want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed
The strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed
One flew astray, and it caught my little seed
Can it be, the ice savage, trife life, made me grab the knife
The righteous man was beat with many stripes, pipes
Take in my energy, breath and know the rest
Cause the good die young and the hard die best


You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way


Y'all bitches love dances, and pulling down your pants
While your man's on tour, your spending up his advances
Your friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke, and suck dick
The whole projects is trapped in stench
You either high school drop-outs, one to three cop-outs
Fifteen years old, shorty ass and top out
Ninety-nine cent beer drinking pussy stinking
Fucking so much your ass and titties start shrinking
New World Order slave trade, minimum wage, Medicaid
Can a devil fool a Muslim nowadays
Inside my lab, I'm going mad
Took two drags off the blunts, and started breaking down the flag
The blue is for the Crips, the red is for the Bloods
The whites for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs
Or the slugs that ignites, through the night, by the dawn
Early light, why is sons fighting for the stripe


As we dwell through this concrete hell, calling it home
Mama say, take your time young man and build your own
Don't wind up like your old dad
Still searching for them glory days he never had
So many bad want to scheme for American dream, no more kings
The cash rule everything now, we going down
These babies looking up to us, it's up to us
The Million Man March MC's, get on the bus
But envy, greed, lust, and hate, separate
Though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
No longer, brothers, we unstable
Like Kane when he slew Abel, killing each other


You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way




My mother said my father was a real livewire
Hustled on the avenue of Lennox
That he was a don, shot dope in his arm
Paid visits to the methodon clinic
A straight womanizer, no religion
He just leaned on bitches
His name rung in the slums, niggas run for they gun
Blood thirsty, he was so vicious


Poppa was a rolling stone (he left a long time ago)
Poppa was a rolling stone (he never ever was at home, no, no)
Momma said daddy's dead (stop messing with the baby's head)
One day he'll grow up strong (one day he'll be a man)


Momma said father was a mean muthafucka
A clean muthafucka, a lean muthafucka
Got money in the pot, got his pops in the block
For sellings rocks, a dope fiend, muthafuckas
He struggled all his life, got blood on his knife
Light skinned, he had your eyes
But my mother couldn't handle him
The liquor, the gambling, plus he had four wives




My mother said my father had a real bad temper
Loud, wild, he was too foul
With no hesitation, he would kill you
With no education, he was still proud
With his brother Big Harvey, he did a bank robbery
A car flipped, all the money spilled out
Before it was done, police caught him with some
Riddle of bullets, he died in a shootout






Hey wait a minute, man, what about me?
Hey wait a minute, y'all got
Y'all play a role in a racket flow
It was an act of God
I don't know what kind of act it was
I don't know how a junkie bust into my room and stole my TV
Hey, it wasn't me, man
Why ain't you out here arrestin' him?
Instead of runnin' him out
It was me, I confess! I confess!
Dead story, a respectable workin' person can't even walk 5 minutes
On the street without somethin' happenin'
All you cops don't do nothin'!
Junkier than police, one right behind the other with his hand out
Oh, baby, he's gonna get rid of both of you cops


Ayo, we always gon' hit heads left and right
We always gon' get dumb skets to fight
We always smoke and drink to set shit right
Yo it's always gon' be left, to we left the light


We always gon' be thug niggas and see drug figures
Always gon' be stuck on the block, fuckin' with cops
Always gon' get McGirts, liftin' skirts
Turn around and let the click just work
We always gon' be chasin' cash, racin' fast
Like we don't need life yo
It's always gon' be street life
We always gon' bank the dough, spank the hoe
Drink some Mo', you better act like you think you know
It's always gon' be Queens N.Y
Always gon' be scenes when men die
We always gon' be doin' time for doin' crimes
It's always gon' be in Riker's Island
We always gon' be "life is wildin"
We always gon' be puffed out, mobbed out
With your bitch gettin' dogged out
And the click gettin' slobbed out
Love between thugs, it's love between clubs
It's always gon' be, like the giddy, it's always ownin' me
We always gon' shake the dice, stay laced in ice
Talk the Judas down when we hate the price
Always gon' keep it funky
It's always gon' be grungy
We always gon' eat cuz we always gon' be Hungry
We always gon' grab the dick, try to bag a chick
And walk around with a grill like we mad at shit
We always gon' be in project hallways
Crowdin' up the doorways, drownin' up the Jorday's
We always gon' be naughty
Liberty bassly, forty, niggas be crazy, whodi
Always




Yo it's a..


....warnin', East New York niggas formin'
Beats say Bang Ya Head, Sister Sledge
War dance with the wild Apache Indian
Get Tom machine gun, fast car, big engine
Few squads for the back massage, head job
Then it's back to business
Murder one, leave no witness
Snatch mic, bash face and fight
Red light scope at night
Movin' through the Snow dressed in White
It's the ninja from the rooftop site
Aim for the brain, snipe from the buildin' across the boulevard
Hit him from a hundred yards
I just got a type from 'Preme behind bars
Peace God, you beat niggas up, I suppose
Sixteen metal machine I still hold
Shoot snub from ear lobe
Fortified rich with Twelve Jewelz of Islam
Walk humble and calm
Newspaper under the arm conceal arms


You want it rough? That Hellfire stuff?
Poisonous mics, yo make the party jump
Delicious, the funk, make your heart pump
Told ya, soldiers get over the hump
Your arms are too short boy you don't wanna rump
With U-God the grump, van, black truck
Ha, heavy on the grams, every man back up
Niggas act up, let the style spin
This is Knockout Kings 2000 again
Let the style in for a few proud men
Clifton Project, rugged grain Shaolin
Women in the bed, wolves are fed
Same Wu Chamber that Bang Ya Head
Aim with the stainless, hang like dreads
Dirty at the game but the same celebs

Chorus


Yo, yo, yo
Is it the hate that make me sip the Hennessey straight?
Then go and leave my enemy face, simply erase
Make me hop out the Benz with the Tennessee plates
Make me run up in ya house shoutin', "Empty the safe"
Or could it be love? Make be rock the hoodie and gloves
Wonder if Snoop wasn't Crip, would he be Blood?
Or maybe it's where I'm from, Bushwick
That got me wearin' my gun everywhere that I come
Why your chick got my pubic hair on her tongue
Uh-huh, if you wanna see the light, nigga, stare at the sun
Can it be my older days that gave me my colder ways?
Blowin' strays at your rollerblades
Whatever it be, that make me take your leather and flee
Evidently, livin' legal never was me


Yo we livin' it, lovin' every minute, won't quit it
Hollow points aim with your first name printed
In it for the money, never did it for love
Made a few enemies, couldn't limit the slugs
Never talk much, got ways of handlin' such
The enforcer, cause the police to rush
On the daily, rarely seen, often heard
You can spot me in the Hill layin' off of the curb
On the verge of snatchin' up ya crown and throne
While I walk through the heart of the Hell and call it home
Shao' borough Commando, style thorough
Wild like a convict lose on the furlo 


Oh baby he's gonna get rid of both y'all cops



* promotional EP released on Razor Sharp Records in late '97

Chorus: U-God

Hysterical lyrical launch, anotha riddle
A miracle little by little, fits right up the middle
*repeat 2X*


Let us milk this cow, the best way we know how
Park Hill projects, chicka-POW
One culture, return of the track slasher
Double doser, Cappadonna broadcaster
Strivin for perfection, the only way I got
My life back was through investin, devotion
Movin my soul toward the skit, vocabulary
Comin out my ass like shit, to feed my babies
I gotta fight y'all MC's, this money
Be gettin me high just like trees in these tracks
I milk for all my childhood, make me feel good
So I keep on writin meditatin in the ghetto
Makin love waitin for lost minds to settle
Then I speak out, because we all need the guidance
Deep down inside is where you could define science
My mother told me, when I was so stressed out
"All you gotta do is just put your best out"
And I did it

Chorus 2X


Yo, new Cappadonna is about to exhale kid
Hold all the phone calls, stop all the mail
Cappadonna raise hell, speak and I broke the shells
Seen brothers that fell when I slipped
I had my alibi tight that night, up in the Hill chillin
Y'all'll get shot, move away things are too hot
Look at my spot now, friends are exiled from close distance
I broke resistance, every time I step up, I rip reps up
Ku Klux, my words swing around like numchucks
This ain't for big bucks, never can quit this rap shit
It feeds my seeds, I can barely breathe
But y'all cats better believe keep off, your darts are soft
While I throw these missiles, at your skin tissue
You can't escape I absorb, gigantic crowds all aboard
Watch out for city fraud, my darts slam like doors
Makin it hard for you to get yours, selfish

Chorus 2X




(I'll give you anything)
I like that, y'all, I like that ya like
(I'll give you anything, baby)
I like that, y'all, I like that like that

(I'll give you anything baby)
I like that, y'all, check it out check it out


Anticipation of what's to come
I'm so happy that I'm the lucky one
So long I've waited but it's never too late for love
It feels so right, baby that it can't be wrong
Where I am weak baby you make me strong
I'm down for you and whatever you want to do
It's all up to you because


Anything for you I am gonna try to
I'm bonafide, body's just for you
Pleasure every way you can ride
Just to get with you
If you choose to


Whatever method used is alright with me
As long as you get to where you need to be
This is the vision made for both of our eyes to see
It feels so right, it can't be wrong
Where I am weak baby you make me strong
I'm down for you and whatever you want to do
It's all up to you because




Dirty Bas, style cuts like glass
Gotta gotta keep it high power to the mass
Yo Taj, another-like platinum hit
Party people all around be sayin that's the shit


Kaboom, guess who stepped in the room
Tical, hailing from the Shaolin Isle
It be me the killer bee, on the M-I-C
With the S-S-double-double-U to the V-V
Me me going downtown, let me see
If we all and together now, make it mo' better now
Listen I ain't sweating no competition
Flow, going mad low like I'm dissing


Another chapter from the Wu-Tang group
Take a look or a peak, killer bees never sleep
Nonstop put you on the chopping block
Unorthodox, attitude to melting pot


I'll do anything, I'm so into you
Right here, I'm Weak, downtown with the Wu
Kaboom, guess who stepped in the room
The S-S-double-double-U to the V-V


Anything you want me to do I'll do it
Oh, anything that you want me to do, to do
Anything you want me to do I'll do it
Oh, anything that you want me to do, to do
It's all up to you
Anything
That you want me to do
You can have it
Ooohh
Anything you want to do right now

Anything that you want to do
Boy I'm gonna try to
My body's just for you
My love's just for you
The destination
You can drive
You can drive us there
If you choose to, this love is for you
Anything that you want to do
Boy I'm gonna try to
My body's just for you
My love's just for you
The destination
You can drive
You can drive us there
If you choose to, this love is for you




Give me the cue


Skip the introduction proceed to lip function
The junction get rushed by some grimy people busting weed
Splatter your melon like some Attica felons
Use a firearm good, Bloods go for heart swelling
Insert the spasm, yes the dirty herb has him
Thoroughbred thugs insert the fantasm
Verbal smarts, spark the word, visit my scripture
Exotic wine, holding nine Picasso pictures
When the rhyme pivot you now, limit your chance
Bodyguard the lyric with unlimited stance
Words seem to zing on down to Beijing
When we touch down, would you crown renowned kings


There's no honor amongst thieves
Street pharmaceutical stack like Genovese
The Four Devils tempt madmen but not these
We profound hardcore sound to MCs, thumbs down, prepare
Killa bees it be warfare, this the year
Niggas gotta take you off of here, hold the square
If we go there we go gritty and spread fear
Through this rap city, call the mayor
My razor sharp darts be like cold stares
The smell of fear make my nostrils flair, truth or dare?
Ask yourself can you compare to these niggas in the hood
Johnny B. Goode or he be gone yeah
The struggle goes on, you've been warned
PLO from here to Lebanon, how many bomb
Must we drop in the Ninety-Now?
Walk a mile in my shoes, get the street news from Meth-Tical


Glocks'll be spitting, you gots to be kidding
Aiyo kid you gots to be kidding
Or Glocks'll be spitting
You gots to be kidding yo


It's common sense how I master my circumference, you dense
I get locked the fuck up, released on my own recognizance
Can't be judged, young bloods bust back like scuds
Wu-Tang hovers one thousand notches above
MC level, yo, I stay highs like treble
Foes who oppose get plucked like rose petals
Arresting and holding, penetrate forbidden regions
Wack MCs only lasting one season
The morale was low at the corral
Adjective pronouns had no style, your weak proposal
Aim for the official, initial is Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah
All that other bullshit ain't permissible
Annual increase of the Wu-Tang Manual
Handles to keep all this Hip Hop shit tangible
Illegible, every egg ain't edible
My tracks remain 'Unforgettable' like Ol' Nat Cole
Got to catch this paper to buy Shaquasia a glacier
Nebuchadnezzar skyscraper
Understanding the continents of Africa and Asia
And free the Black Man from enslaved labor, Wu-Tang


The weight of the fam is on our back and we can't fall
Victim to this long hall of fame, meaning nothing
We came to punish the glutton with a substance
That can't be contained, Wu-Tang


Motherfuckers
We be seeing y'all asses when we walk up in the club
Y'all all in the back
Scared to speak, we speak cause you scared
Punk motherfucker, we know what time it is


All you been seeing is upsets in the boxing shit, right
It's like come on man
This nigga fucked up motherfucking Whitaker
Dang, he caught Whitaker
He caught Whitaker a long time ago
Mike got touched
Then Mike got touched by Holyfield
Hey Mike's, Mike's gonna forfeit this fight
He ain't fighting McDermit
He ain't fighting
Nope
Whattup
You talking bout he, what he, what he, what he did
Told them he cut his eye, in sparring


Stella D'oro wrap breadsticks, David Berkowitz
Einstein birthed a hit, now nurture it
M.G.M. front row seat tonight, no gems
Purify, cleanse, ran into some beef up in the men's
Fix your sawed off, Wu-Tang tore me off the cross
All you saw was white meat, skin hanging off
These is words from the Arch Bishop, some call it six up
The Betty Crocker Marvel cake, snakes will miss a
Wax janitor, black Jack Mulligan from Canada
Slam dance, tarantula style, you's a fan of the
Monopoly king, Slavic poetry
Carnegie Hall's off the hook, let's push through the armory
Mack truck hitting soloist, Soul Controllers
Behold of the thousand teeth fist, swift and boneless


You know cause Wu-Tang is invincible, you know what I mean
It's Wu-Tang Forever God
We gonna get down with that W
You gonna get down with that W
That's that Wu, that's that Wisdom
That's the Wisdom of the Universe
That's the truth, of Allah, for the Nation of the Gods
YouknowhatI'msayin

We got the medicine for your sickness
Out here, ya knowhatImean

Word man it's Wu-Tang Forever God
Niggas can't fuck with these lyrics God

If the world blowing up I'll be right there
Nigga throw it up I'll be right there
Just call me up I'll be right there
Wu throw it up I'll be right there
I'll be right there, I'll be right there


Yeah, this is it yo the final chapter
Got'cha back nigga chiropractor
Fuck with my brother gonna have to clap with'cha
Mess with my brother going back to Attica
He the nucleus, I'm the reactor
Wolf scarred, battle star galactica
Solid gold, I'ma fold and package ya
Repzar nigga I'm a rhythm trafficker
Up against the wall, I'ma sandwich ya
All-star pro, you's a amateur
Damager, bandager, examiner, stamina
I love the fame, I love the props
I'm from the drug game, I hug the block
There's the stage, I'm ready to rock
Yo RZA hit me up when the mic gets hot



 X2
Set it up, I tear it down
Wet it up, I shake the town
Place your bet, I'ma lay it down
Ready Set, I'ma take the crown


I got the respect when I hit the South
I'm the connect yo forget the drought
You cross me once, bitch you out
Now ask yourself what the grits about
I'ma chew you up, spit you out
You see this hard rock nigga, forget the doubt
Computer programmer, just click the mouse
I want fifty K hits nigga watch the bounce
Now to the ounce, I'm keying notes
Ya'll beating niggas, ya'll pumping soap
I'm eating niggas, I'm so cutthroat
Watch a one-armed nigga just cut the dope



 X2

I'll be right there X8




Feel the heat from the streets, I got to eat
Talk what I walk, I stalk with bronze feet
Ancient spells, yell durag sheet
Jump on the jame with with 36 peak
Beat up the beat, overload rap treat mix
Cape in the wind like the John Woo flicks
Now, take the spirit, crash more clearer
The sweat of the body, covers the man in the mirror
Kick down the door, unlease the Terror Fam
Cracklin, screamin, crime who I am *echo*
Who else could cut, well budge, eye on the tiger rap
Ruler rough mind snap, cryin, his eyes strapped
Beneath clothin, prehaps speed glowin
The golden wise domes, blizzard unknown
The unforbidden, got to live, wildstyle begun
So uplift the mind, boy I'll bring out the sun


You trapped in this rap in this world bizarre
And ya hit pretty hard in the city of frauds
But uplift the mind and I heal ya scars
Cuz rich, tall or small, we all shinin stars


Now, first of all, yo, we ain't no saints
Can we lay in the trench and rock the war paint?
The same villain scheme, temper made the rhythm mean
My self-esteem, my '98 blade hit 'em
Link spot blast, even though I shot last
The underdog stranger, superfreak hot blast
The hard drop rip is a hostile swing
Kiss my Redemption with a fist full of sting
Swift with the gifts, it's the God Body Squad
It's not a myth, we defy all odds
Now, reach for the stars, now top to the limit
But, all in the all be
Grateful to be livin
While we work the muscle, we meditate the hustle
Serious the world, experience this struggle
The razor voice, flavor choice steam, redeem
We feelin prominent now to dominate the scene
The grass more green, attack speed lean
The cliffhanger vaccine, man & machine *echo*
Now from round one, mayor style sum
I won't stop the war till y'all drown in my drums




Now, here come the rhythm, style that's moist
Now, it's up from the Hell with the olive oil voice
Now hurry my hurt, bury dirt deep within
Against sweaty rap war starvin, robbin the wind
Out the great blue skies and the bright red birds
From the pitch black city with the long link furs
Golden Arms yours truly to restore the Earth's beauty
Grant me a beast, now kill me with the jury
When I tell on a capell, Hell has no fury
A force has awakened, breath-takin vengeance
Midnight power plant, seekin the menace
My wrestler's vest, livin fresh, dry bone
My appetite distruction is official cyclones
Thai poems, my throne
One shot fill, bigger homes, bigger stones
It's on now!!!



Kung Fu movie sample:

 We're the best, I assure you
 That's not what I've heard
There's a lot of Shaolin men around here
 They're not important
 Are you trying to deceive me?
 Those damn Shaolin students. They're just a bunch of rebels
Time and again in the past, the court has given orders
To wipe them out!
 Be the Shaolin, and a good teacher
 Who is this man?
 The God of War!






Burn something kid


Yeah, youknowwhatImsaying, let me tell you something man
Through the man's mind, God
He see his elevation, God
See through his mind, he see his elevation, God
See this where he begin to know that where he come from
See some people don't have no direction, God
Because they don't know the science of they self
See the signs of life is the signs of you
All the elements that it took to create you
Everything that's in the universe, God
That's created the universe, God, is just within you
You see what I'm sayin?
And that's the mind that you can't see
Don't you know if a man could take and flip himself inside out, God
He'll fall out and die if he sees the shit that goes on...inside?


So you mean to tell me I'm the creator of all this right here?


You the creator of all this
Because all these things must happen, it must take place
See people go back in the day, God
They say: one man, one woman, Adam and Eve, there ain't no such thing
Everything you see always has been and always will what be
Regardless the womb or what, it's got to be


Hit me, hit me, hit me, I don't wanna hear nothin
Word Up
Got to pay
Yeah, it's like that right?
Blow his back out, make his shoes worth


A-yo, this shit be off the noggin rock it
Whatever cock block it
Cat get blown, who own this street corner
Foreigner hesitate to rock a Hummer
Navy Seal top runner, rhyme this summer
For real, marinating nigga's skating
Debating waiting style flowingly relating
Fine line switch it on ya, like venetian blinds
The mission is mine, fabulous king I divine
Titanium Hydro collide though
Yo dun dun polly this conjunction, son one
Slang doctor, medicated kids pay it
Say it, these niggas in affect dun, stay rap related
Cassette rhymer, 5-G consigner, line for liner
Poet designer, sharp like Linus
Mic of the year award, fly gear award
Them niggas over there be analyzing with one sword
Get bent, pay the rent, plus still we invent
Nuff shit to get your whole team crazily sent
Now all I need is a half gallon of weed
Proceed, to bust this mic dick and make three seeds
Then max out like two Ac's inside the parking lot
Son bark a lot and get his team hit in the dark a lot
What now blow, clicking like a calico
Gold, Maximillion, one love keep it real yo


Yo, hit me for these Tommy Hill, ice-rocking niggas
Peace, this summer's mines, I blow the biggest
Back up off me, while I grab my dick and hold the Heini
Park the Blue 600, Wally kings is right behind me
Tackle clubs, never rock Lugz, I'm way above
These mics is like the Golden Gloves verses spark plug
Its like the pennant, seminar's the play-off
Start the J off like Cochran got OJ off
This specialist who eyeballed your mistress necklace
Perpetuous, this curly-head kid's treacherous
Let go the eggo, so we can dip dip dive like Lego
Throw on can-can, eat that plus this instrumental
Ah shit say Stark-ologist
Starks-ologist, fried fish halibut
Pull out the bull horn, let's celebrate like Kunta was born
We elbowed our way inside Loud and got on
I played the building, burn a branch and get filled in
Like Pilgrims G-in' Pepridge farms from out of millions
Who wanna rhyme, who wanna challenge the swordmans
That rock that fisherman hat like Gorton's


I hold down the place, no shots to the face
Elite Special force no religious style faith
The melting pot boil gun shot drama soil
Gamble when I scramble handle hot pots of oil
Manhandle pain killing erect my hidden
Streets made me potent put your 9-6 bid in
Vampire curse disperse on each verse
Swim in black water, act slaughter through my earth
You're hit by my element Great Wall of China
Mountain peak holds the globe like vagina
Measure on my mic stand, molecule and strand
Finger rolling rhythm ride the horse one hand
Golden Eye, Spy vs. Spy, guilty of suspicion
Chess boxer, mic in dead body position
40 oz. Ciga-art, three verse invention
Divine universal black man representing
Similar to pure, rhyme blowing out the pore
Battery in the back, keep me charged for the raw
I'm bred type thorough, pistolero gun hero
Renaissance rebel chatter-boxing your barrel
Fully woven Beethoven, hit you on a humble
Hard enough to hurt you, chastise my rap styles
Lock down, for this curfew




Hard days of work
You had a hard day at work baby
I want you to sit down, relax
While I soak you in my mentals
Backrub style, watch this, yo, yo
Massage, peppermint oil, shampoo and pears
Cinnamin, aloe, natural for you hair
Soak lavender soap, coconut conditioning
Honey lather, blood flowing, love listening
Motion lotion, breeze, over the ocean
Lovers, bath crystals, lovers sponge scrubbers
Hot milk bath, steam shower rubbin
Diesel splash, long lovin in your oven
Bake it off, break it off 'til it gets soft
Passion fruit, pussy cat, want to touch it off
In and out, fragrance patience, Hershey's Kisses, Guinness Stout
Stress reliever soak your feet, air them out
Brain message, think about pink
Stress relieving, no dishes in the sink
Upper lower, left, right, neck don't play
Back rub, Calgon, take me away
Waterfall beads, streams, plush and lavish
Comfort me through all the damn madness
Night breeze at sea, sipping tea
You and your queen melodies, and trees, 85 degrees
Jet skis breeze...
Sprinkle water on chocolate, butter scotch flowers
Vapor action, tropical sunshower
Baby powder, relax, feel for an hour
Sand suntan, snuggled up snug
Snowey days, fireplace, oriental rug
Thugs, lay on the couch, pull it out, perfect balance
Chemical stimuli, two tokes off the chalace
Complete silence, what surround us
Whats the finest, wrapped in cold sheets
Vanilla apple heat, flutes play jazz music, puffy pillow suites
Breakfast in bed, early morning sun treats
Sunset level, suprise sunrise, sail
Lay on the couch, while I clip your toenails
Dreams of peaches and cream steam secret spells
Soft spoken gospel, Barry White acapell
Violin, good medicine, sound swell
Sunshine life, love right without the hell
Taste sugar, quiet storm, seasick
Slowdance drink, like nights over Egypt
Having, stabbing, calm chilling now we rolling
Company, ice cream licking now we holding
Gentle force, warm tingle of the golden
Open loose, ice cubes, kiss your belly
Alcohol, palm trees, peanut butter jelly
Almond twirl, fantastic melodies
Soon, taste these spoons
Wiping me with toon, fly wine, quiet storm
Now it's high noon, raspberry spices
Cherry breath, drink from the mountain, sip the very best
Sounds of the shore, every winter is a war
Paradise life, recipe now pour
Musicness, model, gentle mental
Wash away your sorrow, Fantasy Island
Put the message in the bottle
Carry you through, the threshold, do my duty
Happy ending, go to rest Sleeping Beauty


Yo, this is that body shop shit
Love love slam
Edible underwear, champagne, bubble bath
Have your snack on that ass that
Know what I mean?
Massaging these melodies
Put that gangsta shit on the shelf
Blow winds, blow, through your hair
Sea breeze sticks and shit
Right right


When your around boo
Come and chop this mother fucking beat you stank-ass trick



(It's a hard ...)
Black milk
It's hard in these streets

From Mecca to Jerusalem
All day every day
(I'm calling you on the phone)
(I'm just holding you my darling)
(You're my all)


Toe flex we bout to blow like octane
You know Cannibal Ox got mad slang
Who cares what you're named
They say a man who repeats himself is insane
I mix my saliva with propane
Flame on I spit that hot fire with Dylan
And stay inside the line with crayons
My whole aura is neon, ultra violet
Come out your mouth
I might get ultra violent
Now it's so quiet
You was popping that junk
Now it's so silent
Here's another token
We are the chosen
Wolves in the coven
Blade of the Ronin
(I'm calling you on the phone)
(I'm just holding you my darling)
(You're my all)


We deliver the livest your novice we polish
Acknowledge  mad men, shottas and god fathers
I rock the flow brick city bandit, im doctor no
Star studded glow cardio bars we give the go
Administer quotes
Diminish folks in minutes call it dinner time
Eat your food, rude or push harder to the finish line
 shine, musically we harness
Due process and Marcus flawless bombers
All time writers and fly garments
Marvellous talking prior markings, fire for warning
Inspired informant desired the entire performance
Niggas is boring we got the remedy virus in storage
Hennesy pouring, AOF, cannibal ox recording ah
(I'm calling you on the phone)
(I'm just holding you my darling)
(You're my all)


Formalities and certain chances and variant circumstances
In surge of advancing
To miss the pivotal point
Integral click and digitally went spittin'
Never that vacant transmission
Getting off ways like jet motto
Livin in ways you set morals the righteous path
Write on pads and lace audio, keeping kids
Being more intuitive monstrous
Learning origami, with folding paper into Ferraris
We move conscience, speed gazing, navigation
Looking like lasers, through night mazes
(I'm calling you on the phone)
(I'm just holding you my darling)
(You're my all)


Did you hear of it?
Im harsh as the march chapter in the spearmint
With enough psychoactive synthetic substances to begin with
Generate combine within, to transcending
The second Nordic artefact independent descendent
Psychedelic therapy magic, meditation
The ritual is verical spiritual dedication
Well established hip hop savage with the cabbage
On average with multiple sounds of blackness
This is black magic, true art from new jeruz new arc
With two part documentaries fireworks shoot sparks
Go beyond we draw fire like kobes arm
In hip hop i go grimlock on stages that they throw me on
(I'm calling you on the phone)
(I'm just holding you my darling)
(You're my all)


First class nigga
She on me like axe on my chest
Fresh like crest, straight headshots only lames aim for the best
Im taking 99.9 percent of the bet
Y'all can have all the rest, stress
Intravenously I feed these niggas the truth serum
Spit fire like he got a dragon in the booth with him
Hold your head and stand still
Balance the equilibrium
Process the beat, create heat
Faster then the pentium processor
Through the hood known as the pie stretcher
Measure the texture of the fish scale upon the dresser
Own a sea biscuit win by a nose on the track
Live at the aqueduct
NY yank on the hat
Whos up to bat
Sending a SOS to the slums of shao-lin
And to the late night husters on the north side of the island
Surveillance at the corner my eye
Bitch get off the snapchat and drive
I'm being followed because i sold a thousand instgrams, glide...




Ayo it's war on the street, blood on the cobblestone
I leave 'em buried alive, just like a fossil bone
Body bags line the streets, reporters reportin'
Mafia ties, drugs and extortion
DeLucas vs. Stark-iano, headline the news
Police pull war on crime, they're gonna lose
Judges get kidnapped, captains get decapitated
Starks rise above all to be emancipated
Black Godfather, families at war
Drive bys and Molotovs settle the score
Butcher shops are filled with chopped up casualties
I made sure to keep guns in all my faculties
The streets run red when the bosses disrespect us
Neglected, I guarantee no man's protected
To each his own, grab a gun off the shelf
Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self


Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self
Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self


How you prepare for war? Grab your guns and your hardware
Never close your eyes in the barber chair
The heart of a lion, that's what got him here
Bulletproof the car, yo, we outta here
Fuck the DeLucas, we've got shooters with submachines
Bone-crushing niggas like a football team, under a new regime
The old we throw it out, spin back the hammer, let the lord sort 'em out
Keep your gun cocked, at the whorehouse, sip the brown liquor
While we move a quarter ounce, pick the territories
Move north or south, the high power shine, yours is watered down
I'm underground, with the vest is on, open up your head
Now your flesh is torn, never turn my back up at restaurants
Put holes in your chest, come test the don
45 in my holster, let me stretch my arms




So the DeLucas want Tone? Nah, not today
Cock and spray, side with 'em and you've got to pay
Don't even kill 'em, just make 'em feel a lot of pain
Stake out his wife and his seed at the soccer game
Greet 'em with open arms, beat 'em with no regard
Feed 'em two two-threes, freeze 'em, leave 'em with no resolve
Make a lead on me, repping for the territory
No stepping on me, brethren that's a negatory
You want a war? These men pop dangerous
Taking all in a 10 block radius
Murder rate double, triple, cripple the strip
Like it got hit with a couple of missiles
8 will fly through your door, I'll get in your crib
In a wig, in a cable guy uniform
My shooters maneuver, we've got DeLuca in the scope
Moving close, say the word, Tone, dude is ghost

Start the fuckin' show! (G-O-D, baby!)
Yeah, G-O-D, U-G-O-D
Uey!! Yeah U-G-O-D!


Who the bad mother brother with the super sperm
That's waiting in the corner, for his return?
Ya'll step back cuz the trigger is lethal ---
He's a cool cool cat, you know where he's at
Fast on the fate, don't pull your blade
Cool dude, now here is the sequel ---
He ride the rhyme with new releases
And rock you deep, and hold you tight
Crack your back in a million pieces ---
Whoooo, he sly as a fox, cause major pain
And fly when he box, when he play the game
Slide from the cops, and grab your dames --
Whoooo, he sly in the sequel, and your eye ain't quicker than
Cut your posters, zero, nine
He freak you out, til you down right simple
He's bad, he'll blow yo mind...




Ol' Dirty kickin' your ass
The things that you learnt in class, is trash
You can't do nothing with it, I put you in the past
The pilgrim muthafuckas -- shut the fuck up!
I do it to you bad luck, the hair get plucked
The only thing on your brain is to give me this cash
And stay out of business, cuz I'm takin' your cash
This world belong to me, none of y'all free
I got y'all in -- slavery
The habit of breathing, the hope to find
That you're misbehaving, Link your Cuban
Fuck your booing, flash the burners
On your crewing, cuz I'm much different from
The other M.C.'s, I got the amazing ability
I get on the mic, so you can have a ball (break that break)
I can fly through the air and stick to the wall
I can take a punch, or get hit by a car
Could go to the nearest or farthest star
As a matter of fact, that's what I won't talk about
How I'm going outer space, just to be in the house
How I'm going outer space, ---- -- be in the house


Break that break (nah-nah-nah-nah)


I'm that mic enhancer, the beat programmer
When Ason Unique speak, he throw hammers
And we go bananas over old school breaks
I take an old school loop and break it on yo face
I start from a clean slate, bang you on the waistline
Deep Space Nine, Math smash the bass line
I break spines, til they fraction or splinter
I want Michael Jackson money, just a fraction of Thriller
Deep in, the laboratory, manufacture the Zilla
Cock, notch category, capture the realer
We the ex-drug dealers, still serving them fiends
With TV's in the car, the size of movie screens
You know the routine, give 'em what they need
That disco shit, satisfaction guaranteed




Yeah, 1-2-3, microphone check
In the place to be, as you can see
This is Wu-Tang Clan guest starring M.C
With no harm intended, nobody offended
Carry on with the social, nothing but a party tonight
Special invite, ladies free before midnight
We lock the club down, clash sound hear the guns pop
See D.J.'s spin, counter clock, keep gridlocked
Line around the block, women by the flock
Wanna party with the great, I reap Jamel
Ring bells throughout the state
Diggin' in the crates, for the old school
Remix, nice it up for the people
Ladies want the hardest stiff, to spread eagle






She get down right crunk, ahh
She love an east coast thug, right
She got a down south bump, ahh
She looking nice iced up, now


All that I know is I rock and roll
Do you tell, I got hellafied breathe control
Let it go, get bowl, strip clothes
Slip slow, down to the poles
Dip low, get dough, let put these dollars between yo legs
Bounce off the walls, careful on my balls, cuz they fragile as eggs
Got rhymes for days, heatwaves, that's what you want
I'm that Kid with the Golden Arms, In the all black Saint Laronz
He bowls, he flaws on these broads, miss, put on yo lip gloss
So much junk in yo trunk, a monster dump, keep breaking my stick on




Bump-bump, yo body-body, bump yo body-body
Bump yo body-be, bump-bump, yo body-body
Bump yo body-body, bump yo body-body
Bump yo body-be, bump-bump, yo body-body


She's a cold dirty dirty, a cold dirty dirty
She gets right down to it, owww, she's a flirty
She's a fly young lady, down talk to strangers
She lives in Atlanta, rock platinum danglers
She's so outrageous, she's such a freak
She throw that game, better bow to her feet
She shake that ass, you want that sex
She so independent and she wants her respect






I know what type of girls I like
Big bump on the motor bike
Better tell her, I'm going fast
Better tell her, hold on tight










Wait, hold up, chill, what's that, son?
Damn nigga got fucked, shit, huh?!
By his back, watch nigga run
Seven the center of your eight point Sun
Hold tight grip on the God-U Now, you best be careful!
Can't dodge two Self-Hes aimed at your domepiece
Father-U-C-King police!!


Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum
Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum


Yo, Rae it's been a long time son since we bust gun
Clap glaciers, ran the world and snatched paper
Return to the 36th Chamber
Proceed with caution as you enter
We have an A.P.B. on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a master


Yo something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang thang
Something in the street went BANG BANG..


Up in the boss game wilding, money for grabs
I ain't fucking with crabs, out of state copped two labs
Hopped two cabs, back on the Ave
Stab you with the vocab, catch me at the big dough rehab
Tryna re-up, keep my feet up
Snake niggas in the cut, hold the product
Time is up, no luck, heat start to bust
Niggas you can't trust, dealing with lust
Seen him at the ballgames with James


Something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang thang
Something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang


Something in the hall went 
The boxcutter went 
Something in the hole went 
The boxcutter went 


These are the bones, bones from the grave of Houdini
G-Deini, Ronzoni noodles sprinkled on your embry'
Climb like the deficit, profits, death threats
To Israel slid through Bethlehem bong on one wheel
Syringes, rubber bands, needles, the 60's
Granddaddy Caddy was copping 6 G's
B'gosh all that Oshkosh jumpers
Pink Champelle, brown paper bags, wall to wall bumpers


These ain't the camera guys, cause, turn your eyes
Sweat on the hammer fly, Ways of the Samurai
Newsflash bulletin, Gods on the prowl
We full again, ruff men scuff Timbs
Sonic bionic lens, RZA console
Is it Bush or the Dole, front row of the Superbowl
Black gold in my soul, on a ho stroll
Don't go boy you on parole you don't know?


Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK


Made 'em throw they hands up but then lay flat
Rat pack eat up, the average alley cat
Prepare for the impact when we contact
Known to drop facts that crack your hard hat
Must I show and prove, trust I, bust I
Make your head spin like chrome 20's on the buggy-I Benz
Who contends, Wu like the Superfriends
Who's your rhyming hero? Wu-Tang rules again


Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK


Yo something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang thang
Something in the street went, BANG BANG..


Something in the hole went 
The boxcutter went 
Something in the hole went 
The boxcutter went 


Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum
Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum




Tommy Mottola, lives on the road
He lost his lady, two months ago
Maybe he'll find her, maybe he won't
Oh wonder that love


Brothers try to pass me, but none could match me
No girl can freak me, I'm just too nasty
Lost on the dance floors, I attack y'all
Snuck through the back door, guess who they saw?
Goldie and Ghost, black African Rose
Star-studded low lenses, plus the mural was dope
Airbrush W-B's, STOP! (Shake your body, body)
And cop a couple of these (She's a hottie, hottie)


Scottfree and Chauncey, very upset
They're sick and tired of living in debt
Tired of roaches and tired of
Rats
I know they are over


One in the head, I'm fed, this is how we doin
Put a Ruff Rider on my dick, bust right through 'em
Come out your shirt, insert the party rhyme
Fine Dr. Buzzard, Bacardi Lime
We passin it, takes the shake your Calvin Klein
Before the floor gets moist, taste and follow mine
Swallow nine, model dimes from Bahamas
Slim doo-doo makers stuffed inside pajamas


They'll take all your rhymes with a Colgate smile, hey baby
They'll love you one second, then hate you the next
Oh ain't it crazy baby, yeah
Tony's his name, the undefeated champion, whoa, yeah (Blow 'em down God)
Now he's alone, he's just the king of his throne (Yeah, aha)
Always will be my friend, Ghostface Killah (Truly yours, peace boo)




That's me, that's right, yo, the Wu in the place
Keep shittin' on me, til you blue in the face
Veterans chase, circulate the rat race
How the hell this dirt bag get on base?
Bang the 808, when he go ape
You just an eighth, I'm kilo weight
Let me demonstrate, when I squeeze the raw
I'm going for the throat, cup of season fall
Honey wit the hips, make me leave the floor
And it's blood, sweat & tears, got her bleeding more
I'm a physicist, but I know what matters
I'm not a doctor, but I'm losing my 'patients'
I talk to the nation, with the deadly manuscript
Accurate long fire, mechanic grip
Make the Titanic flip, from hip hop tonsil
Head fly, head guy of the Jedi Council
Throw me the alleyoop, scoop you off your feet
You just a fluke, the proof is in the heat
Bang on the industry, walk the tightropes
Psycho thinker, a stinker, lyrical blitz
Mix the coke batter like it's Miracle Whip
Highly explosive, fire the wit
Deadly venom stick, to the walls and bricks
All I got is my dick and my balls, my last words
I might swerve, it's just the tip of the iceberg
Precise verbs, slice words, strike superb
Hawkeye in flight, nigga, like the bird
And I want it so bad, I can't fight the urge
When money get tight, yo the spider splurge
I'm on the urge, wit the killa crystals
Deep in the basement, building the missiles
The last one missed you, here sniff two
Big bags of Dopium, black top, jack mack tops
Open 'em, now I'm scoping 'em
Get your feet wet, I end this rhyme
Wit a one, two, three step, yup




Let's spark it, eh..
Yo..


It be the Wu-Gambino, flurry don't stop
You the ice cream, I'm the cherry on top
Scary are cops, cuz I carry the Glock
Look up at my eye, boy, dare me to pop
Hand me my Scotch, Scotch on the rocks
Hundred thousand watts, for my ghetto blocks
Killin' flow level, and the spillin' won't stop
Buildin' my treble, til I fill in my slot
I want my props, I need the shit
In the spotlight, cuz I'm letha kid
Cockblockin' niggas, make the needle skip
Knock out the biggest, and you see me dip
All on the corner, desert eagle grip
Get the benchwarmers, and you see who flip
Bless my endurance, he who get
Never dick ride, or ever ever quit
You say tomato, I say ta-motto
You say potato, I saw pa-tatto
You say today, I say tomorrow
Some say it's mixed and I say it's mulatto


Rippin' and poppin', I'm hippin' and hoppin' it (right, right)
I'm hippin' and hoppin', I'm chippin' and choppin' it (right, right)
I'm chippin' and choppin', I'm rippin' and rockin' it (right, right)
I'm rippin' and rockin', I'm drippin' and droppin' it (right, right)


Everytime I flip it (...time I'm flip it) Rip it good (good... good)
I stick it (... I stick it...) Stick it to ya (to ya... to ya...)
We rip it (...we rip it) Rip it good (good... good)
We stick it (... we stick it...) Stick it to ya (to ya... to ya...)


Some niggas see me stressin', askin' me questions
It's like these bitches, so I give 'em lessons, realer professions
I paint your picture, listen, hold these Wessons, know how to bust 'em
When you address them, hit 'em, pushin' buttons, ain't about nothin'
They said he frontin', get him, ain't no stuntin', where I be pumpin'
My niggas, cook him up and I don't care if you sixty somethin'
Catch a concussion for bluffin', take your face in them guns
We been, bustin' shorties, stay in your place, I have your both friends
Tucked in




Chip and chop those rocks away
Hit that block, those doubters wait
Fuck that bitch, with a smiling face
Hold up, shorty, that's in the weight
Back in my grind, now paper chase
No speakers in my hand, but I got the bass
No fear in my face, spit in your face
The .38 cal', will clear the space
We gon' blow the time, I blow these rhymes
Like a bloated nine, cuz it's quoted time
You gon' know this rhyme, you gonna quote my lines
I'm in overdrive, watch the chrome and slide


I'm comin' through cuttin' you up and it's just, the preview
In a sec', I'm a triple X threat, like I'm Vin Diesel
A lethal, feel it, evil, drop another kilo
I'm a hard body c-lo nigga, you know my steelo
Now, it's time to reload, pop goes the weasel
And I'm all about the g-notes, I don't, want no pity
Still on top of New York City, it's all about the gritty
And the pretty women titties poppin', yeah, you see 'em shoppin'
Pull up to the bumper baby, come on, ladies hop in
Give 'em what they ask for, I clean out the dance floor
Dashin' bachelor, another black panth-or
More rap chapters, a natural disaster
Watch out ladies, now, here come the masters




Yeah, yeah (right, right)
I gotta be that nigga that started that shit (right, right)
You don't know, when I got a bitch, I got a bitch (right, right)
I've done started all that platinum in the mouth shit (right, right)
You know, I pimp hard when the time to, you know what I'm sayin'?
When I get down and gritty, muthafuckas know my shit is always
Fuck all that bullshit, fuck what you heard..

Fix your face, when we rhyming, we been crazy
Throw mad bullets at you, jumping in new spacely
All my goons is frustrated, groan at they P.O.'s
It's obvious, we do this, we bust haters
Yo, gun selectors, dumb detectors
Chase my niggas, talking slick, where that Lex kid at?
You know we cool and we Darth Vaders
Always in black uniforms, rocking Clarks and sharp gators
Can't tell me nothing, I've been shaking
Pull out them slammers, regulate the streets, I bake Satan
How many of us it take paper and start a war
It's like starting up a store that sell aces
All my colors and bad brothers, rag coverage
Black gloveses, leathers and glass lovers
Introduce these leaders, wanna take money
These dick beaters, and strangle something up, go get Jesus


Look, the coke, the coka, the cocaine
The C-O-K-E, it's coke, man
They lift the weight up in snow plains
You sniff an eighth up in your brain
The coke, the coka, the cocaine
The C-O-K-E, it's coke, man
The prices rise like some propane
The nicest guys become so fame


Illegal transport, son, I throw bombs back and forth
It's a contact sport, get your arm cracked off
Yo, I blast like I'm task force, stashed in my dash board
Exercise black thought, dance on a catwalk
Grew up on the asphalt, trynna get my grams off
Watch for the hand off, I'mma get my plans off
Like you and your mans off, everybody huddle up
Twenty cent dime pieces, watch the water bubble up
A piece of the puzzle, son, pieces, crumble up
My old righteous troublesome, now I'm into major things
Made it this far, kid, the God got on angel wings
Everytime the flavor bring, tons of coke, mad gross
Two cuts of lactose, I'm underground like railroad
Mad low, son, in this hellhole, an animal
Friendship be flammable, no shame for some to blow
Brains out for fun, over cocaine and guns




Ever since a little youth, I've been bent on stoupes, sipping gin and juice
In the booth, fill the dope game, shooting on bent up hoops
Roll around in stolen cars, nah these ain't no rented coupes
Grimeys behind me, they all grimey, ninety percent of controlled
Lying in the booth, put the ashes in the pipe
Blowtorch to the crack, my fire is winter proof
Old thoughts of black and white pictures, now they developing
Skeletons surrounded by archangels and seraphims
Telegram packages distributed through the whole hood
Tell him this racquet is bad for him but it's so good
Are you a fighter? Real life scuffle, no dirt clean
Plus a muthafucka had to hustle since 13
I got my mind in focus, where you never been at
How you think I made a hundred grand, from where my pen's at
Fuck the fortune and the glamour, I don't need no fame
I piss whiskey and spit fire, I bleed cocaine, muthafucka




FREEZE! ROCK!
FREEZE! ROCK!
FREEZE! ROCK!
FREEZE! ROCK!




A game of chess is like a swordfight:
You must think first before you move
Toad style is immensely strong
And immune to nearly any weapon
When it's properly used it's almost invincible


Raw I'ma give it to ya, with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
Like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MC's approach with slang that's dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushin' force, my force you're doubtin'
I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains


Well, I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary and carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum, and the isle I'm from
Is comin' through with nuff niggas and nuff guns
So if you wanna come sweatin', stressin', contestin'
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk
I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain, there's no way to barricade me
Steamrollin' niggas like an 18 wheeler
With a drunk driver drivin', there's no survivin'


Rough like Timberland wear, yeah
Me and the Clan in 'Yota Landcruisers out there
Peace to all the crooks, all the niggas with bad looks
Bald heads, braids, blow this hook
We pack chrome TEC's, nickel-plated MAC's
Black AC's, drug-dealin' styles in phat stacks
I only been a good nigga for a minute though
'Cause I got to get my props and win it, yo
I got beef with commercial-ass niggas with gold teeth
Lampin' in a Lexus, eatin' beef
Straight up and down, don't even bother
I got 40 niggas up in here now who kill niggas' fathers


My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Bees on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats


Here I go, deep type flow
Jacques Cousteau could never get this low
I'm cherry bombin' shits BOOM!
Just warmin' up a little bit, vroom vroom
Rappinin' is what's happenin'
Keep the pockets stacked and then, hands clap and then
At the party when I move my body
Gotta get up and be somebody!
Grab the microphone, put strength to the bone
DUH DUH DUHenter the Wu-Tang zone
Sure enough when I rock that stuff
Huff? Puff? I'm gonna catch your bluff tuff
Rough, kickin' rhymes like Jim Kelly
Or Alex Haley, I'm a Mi-Beetle Bailey rhymes
Comin' raw style, hardcore
Niggas be comin' to the hip-hop store
Comin' to buy grocery from me
Tryin' to be a hip-hop MC
The law, in order to enter the Wu-Tang
You must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang
Represent the GZA, Abbot
RZA, Shaquan, Inspectah Deck
Dirty Ol' gettin' low with his flow
Introducin' the Ghostface Killah
No one could get iller


My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats


Speakin' of the Devil, psych!
No, it's the God, get the shit right
Mega trife, and yo, I killed you in a past life
On the mic while you was kickin' that fast shit
You reneged, tried again and got blasted
Half-mastered-ass style, mad ruff task
When I struck I had on Timbs and a black mask
Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack
That night, yo, I was hittin' like a spiked bat
And then you thought I was bugged out, and crazy
Strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy
Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs
Never shot thugs, I'm runnin' with thugs that flood mugs
So, grab your 8 plus 1
Start flippin' and trippin', niggas is jettin', I'm lickin' off, son


Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang!


Homicide's is legal and death is the penalty
One justifies the homicide when he dies in his own iniquity?
It's the master of the Mantis Rapture comin' at ya
We have an APB on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a master
Evidence indicates that his stature
Merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
The flow changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like a lie, paralyzin' the victim
You scream as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Movin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
And injure any motherfuckin' contender


My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats




Brand new magnetic Killah Hill scorches
Monster talk bosses, spank 'em, step into my office
Crunch time steroid big boy ditches
Eyes that lay for blood money riches
Switches thug men gunmen dirty lung sticker
Arch-crime Hitler, lurking with the lifter
Shift the man vs. man heavy on the hands
Chef in the kitchen cooking love love..slam!
Blow out the stash; keep the bundle in the bush and the trash
D-up, burn brother for the real..fast
Terrible lung split frame for reala
One-man go low hit man guerilla
Whispering there something of a thriller, killer
Drift, dirty fiend snore, scratch and sniff
Dirty tombs diggin' you and my duty
Rudy, mighty rap now toss another beauty
Truly yours Golden Arms New York native
Talk, shank in my mouth now gangsta walk


(effect)..Rock! Dat's Gangsta
What? Dat's Gangsta
(effect) Rock! Rock on Dat's Gangsta
What?!


When I pump pump you'll prepare for a lump
Magnificent funk plus it's wild on the dump
Suckers can't fuck with the rhymes I conduct
I fuck this mic like some big Mike slut
Put your big shoes on now walk your struts
Thought your last rugged cuts was rough enough? Right?
Snuff you buck you stuck in the guts
Unattainable thrust plus that hammerhead busts
Once I splash acapella wind shaft
This sick wild behavior can't shield from the BLAAST!
Thrash mash the pedal now dash
Outta town slangin' two bricks in my stash
Sound cage of rage livin' that status
That murderous thirst that's reign of the baddest
You heard it here first one verse then you're caught
Everybody jumpin' out gangsta walk rock




Raw, cold winds energize rebels
All our doors swingin' killing floor level
Explode code of silence my violence you respect
Liver than flesh that this mic head the best
Veteran chest never say die never say rest
The hang time derange in this rap game divine
Now change of the range bang with gansta our line
Bust the falcon mic mountain men you know the outcome
Define we pro dynamo I'm still scalpin'
The body countin' rhyme drop put it on kill now
Toil your girl in your Cadillac Seville chill
Golden arch stolen heart no I'm robbin' fed
Baddest women in the bed nigga mobbin'






I want everything, from furry things, heavy rings
In my backyard, that's where I bury kings
I stay cling, dynasty Ming, no worry pains
Buffalo wings, hot springs in the winter time
Pull up a nice thing, looking like I won the Heisman
Passion aside, sweet, call it my icing
Alright then, we both freaks, first class seats
And mountain peaks, as we Tour De France
She kissed me on both cheeks, now I'm off to Greece
Yeah, I'm off the streets, and my fam is better
Rock sister hand by hats with the golden feather
Living off a good time from the golden era, cuz


These, are, my days, of, glory
Whatever it takes
Don't live with regrets, I learned from mistakes, cuz
These, are, my days, of, glory
Work hard for the cheddar
Sunny days ahead, it could only get better, cuz


Cuz I had it, lost it, had it again
In my heart, yo, I had it to win
When my money got short, my Spanish bitch, yo, she vanished again
Now I got it again, I keep the theory is in
Keep minimum friends, that means space in the Benz
Self made movies, keep a face in the lens
I'm gonna rewrite the end of Carlito's Way
It's forever rap shows that the Beatles play
These are glory days, these are sinister times
Your hour glass ran out, now every minute is mine
It's a hundred rap dash cross the finishing line
Yo, I'm easy to get to, but I'm hard to find
It's the Keynote Speaker, I'm one of a kind
Presidential MC, I never resign
Ya'll niggas is blind, cuz you need protection
To the game I'm an artist, cuz I draw attention, cuz



This is now, now is then
Picture me, nigga, following them, I don't follow the trend
Going to the top, following men
For the chores of life, then you swallow them in
Don't wanna get caught with the iron again
Don't wanna be stressed with a bottle of gin
Change the odds of the pen, gon' mind my work
Sit top the empire, watch fireworks, cuz






As we return to the 36 Chambers
The RZA, the GZA, the Ol' Dirty BZA
U-God, Chef, the Ghostface Killah
And Meth, Rebel I soldier for the foreclosure
Don't forget about the Masta yo


Motherfuckers halt when my Colt start stomping
Thunder strikes your land with the jolt
Your stamina level is low like currents from
The volts of relentless punishment that multiplies
At a speed that the naked eye can't detect
The infantry, peep the weapontry as I bomb atomically
Stagnant they stood surrounded and astounded
By this total square mileage of violence that I brung
I've not yet begun to stung, it's the ethics
And rigorous training methods of the Abbott
Incite oversees the opposition
Penetrates then infiltrates, breaking down your resistance
Leaving competition defenceless
Masta, Hip Hop antagonizer
Dumb, deaf and blind civilizer with the silencer


Piledriver Tut boulder face blow Hulk
Anger rap book causing chess blade smoke
Monster truck, punk, elephant gun poke
Jawbreaker humanoid vice grip, choke
Face the inferno, maestro pull it
Pipe hard slang, bite the golden bullet
Never, sold my soul Golden Arm cold stinger
See me on the streets address me stone bringer
Ease away, freeze back, feedback, play out in sweet
Action packed rap, bite it, stomp on the beat
Possess hollow head battle teeth Tony Atlas
Wu status now wisdom to the masses


Cock back my tongue like a hammer
My head is like a nickel-plated bammer
Spit .45 caliber grammar
At the speed of wind makes you bleed within
Crack your skull without penetrating your skin
Reign of champ official, Wu stamp with black pistols
Spent the weekend programming fat tracks at Camp Crystal


Home on the range, rebel with a pen
Writing critically acclaimed scriptures that do you in
Mr. Mef, Hot Nickels
Say my shit holding my sex pistol, deal me in


The bewildering Killa Bee quickly sting ya
I ain't gotta lift one fucking finger
Make sure the God Irief turns on the ringer
We ducking the subpoena
Fatal Flying Guillotine machine from Medina


Check the 150 millimeter heater
As it blows holes through your fucking speaker
(Makin you weaker creeping inches centimeters)
{Fifty caliber street sweeper
Shots from Shaolin that go to Massapequa}


Things'll never be the same after this one
Ghostrider spit flame, lay back and twist one
Recognize the Gods came for one accord
One mind and one common cause, that's the shit Son
Play them crows out position, you might hear me
But you don't listen, competition come and get some on
Red marker still bleeding through the paper
Of his sick premeditated murder caper


I walk with the Shaolin strut, burn a dutch
Watch Street eat 'em up, Cold Crush bum rush
Spot rusher get touched, bagged up, handcuffed
Y'all niggas can't fuck with us


Pass me the Black Velvet, embassy suite, killing me
Spell it, Maxi Priest caught me in a daze up on Delancey Street
Stand solar, deadly vengeance with a crowbar
It's like the dreads worshipping Jah, so Aloha
Pineapple crush, 850 swerve it with a rush
Plush the Canola Range spitting off the roof, holding my change
Yo it's ragtime, universal 12 Monkey mind
It's like stalking through your airport with a chunky .9


The underboss Staten New York
Bloodsport gun talk holding fort back, take 'em to court
It's the burner Shaolin bound face down you gets murdered
Roadblock shell shocked, stretched on a back block
Yo it's warfare when you ring here, slugs fly through mid-air
Landing thugs in wheelchairs from the slugfest
Keeps the iron, where the head rest for the conquest subway
Wordplay ricochet through your projects, crime pays
Matched up in a staircase in a dark place embraced
By the trey-eight, I'm in so deep I can't escape
These crime situations, I stay in man formation
A shot echoes through the ghetto locations y'all remain
P.L.O., slam cats like Bam Bam Bigelow
Throw a flow like Nomo, relate like Fidel Castro
I be the great all pro, hanging MCs by they logos
My street journal reacts and blaze like an inferno




That summer... the summer '88 is the best...
But that's your nostalgia though
"Just for the nostalgia," you gotta say
That's my most nostalgic moment of hip-hop music ever
Right


I'll just sit right here and sing that good, old-school shit to you
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own
Oh baby you know
All that lovemaking we did
Boy, it was so real, I wanna feel that again
Long lost friend from way back when
Eric B was president
Tell me where the melody went
And if you still care, say ''yeah, yeah, yeah''
Sing it like I used to do
This one is for me and you, oh


La-di-da-di-da-di-da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
And oh baby, you know
Make love
Thats how you do it
Just like you did it back then
This is dedicated to you


I'll just sit right here and sing that good old school shit to you
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own
Oh baby you know, that love making we did
Boy, It was so real, I wanna feel that again
Loyal friends from way back then
Tell me can you vision us
36 Chambers high
Feels like were there, yeah yeah yeah
Remix of a fantasy, I hear em singing back to me like...


La-di-da-di-da-di-da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
And oh baby you know. make love
Thats how you do it
Just like you did it back then
This is dedicated to you


Nah, we dont wish todays game was old again
We just wish it wasnt full of Draconian, Babylonian, phony men
FOH my summation fascinates, we have debates
Whos the greatest living or passed away
I ask MC, see what she has to say
Eric B or Master P, some see it differently
87 meant to me? I try to describe it, you try to relive it
I try to revive it hoping that you get it, yeah
Something about La Di Da Di got inside our bodies
Something about My Adidas coming out the speakers
Used to do the Wop or the Pee-Wee Herman
Rest in peace Heavy D, Moneyearnin Mount Vernon
Lets go


La-di-da-di-da-di-da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
And oh baby you know
Make love
Thats how you do it
Just like you did it back then
This is dedicated to you


Oh baby you know
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you




The way that momma raised us was pure faith
So diablo wouldn't faze us or daze us
Or lay us down to sleep
Know the wolf from the sheep
Or the sheep who cried wolf
And threw the deadly hoof
While the wolf was asleep
I keep my mind a ghost
Follow my heart the most
Don't play fools too close
Sleep with my eyes at post
So Diablo won't be hostin the game of life
The knife sits by throats of the young
And blows death straight through the lungs
As the mind gets washed by visions of sugar plums
But we shall overcome cause we ain't dumb
But we ain't smart, they got the girls by the hearts
And the niggas by the nuts
Ear, tongue and butts
Yeah, they're trying to fuck us up
But, shit, you know what's up
We gotta get with the movement
And move men soon
They consume every womb who bares
Beneath the stairs of their doom
Best believe they're gonna shove em in a tomb

Chorus: repeat 4X

Cause everytime I step to the microphone
I put my soul on 2 inch reels
That I don't even own


Early Saturday mornin I was cartoon gazin
Slowly broke into the kitchen
To fill a bowl with some Raisin Bran
As I ran up and down the TV stations
I witnessed Indian Joe
Getting tricked out of this nation
By a silly hillbilly
Who laughed as the shit happened
Everything's the same
The game continued into rappin
Deception is at an all-time high
You give a piece of your soul
To receive some crumbs from the pie
But you know I keep on rappin til the break of dawn
Even though it is my soul that I do not even own

Chorus: repeat 4X


I was po', black and broke
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
Ass-out, wide open waitin for my shit to come on out
Speakin about the time before I got signed
I was coolin behind Coolio in the County Line
My big brother used to say I was an asshole
Didn't graduate, couldn't handle the hassle
Of high school, why fool
Wit' foolish rules and guidelines
Fuck the cap and tassels
Said forget the trade and tried rhymes
Hooked up with J-Swift, got with 2-4-2
Me and my nigga L.A. Jay back at S.C.U
I grab the MIC one-time
Check it, 1-2, we in
Freakin' major flavors with my fellow Nubians
Takin shit to the next level
Too bad I sold my soul to the fuckin devil




So yo yo all I want to do is just tell them cats
On the real, keep your game high man, keep it up
Word up, never stop your goals man, yaknowhatI'msayin?
(For real baby)
And, yo son, on the real I'ma get a sneaker just like y'all


I need help (Because the black man is God)
The government is after me (And the worst is, black man is the Devil)
I need help (So this is to bring everything in the)
Someone help me please (universe within the light)
Someone help me! (Understanding)
They already did 2Pac (My children, all six billion humans)
Biggie Smalls (on the planet Earth)
Someone help me! (Regardless of who or what, I love you)
Someone help me please! (Word is bond, I love you)

Ahh! I'mma groupie for life, about nine wife
All the babies are mine, save a child life
No more doctors deliverin my babies
Stick in pins killing me slowly
To the President you say I'm a welfare fraud
You motherfucking right! Let's burn this dark house white!
Insecure about my ding-dong, married to Babylon
My queen lookin at me like a pawn!


Splash the worst rehearse a verse Flashdance on the universe
Televise the work Network Shop till your neck hurt
What up Dirt? Nine diagram phoenix on your sweatshirt
Thirty-thousand went berserk, it's like clockwork
Rockport Mr. Raw God, hold the fort
Collect thoughts, elect sports, sideswipe, by the white horse
French cut, gleaming in the Benz truck, what up?
Telling my mens what? Ten times platinum and we ends up
Draped out, jumpin out a cake, now throw your tape out
Furniture style, holdin the mic we got it laid out
Mind iodine Einstein remind mine
People swam nine didn't know they own kind wrong time
Denim rap, competition quick, handle that
Sucking the jim hat, perverting on my raps'll get you slidapped
Mix drink Cuban Link lizink, flip a to zinc
Plus, expensive like a Roman mink, now think


An ugly thirty-six chamber degree, what, you wanna rhyme?
Deep bring 600 ABC through the love white hate line
I'm telling you tornado, 42 billion thought travel
The year 90's parallel, controls to the wakes
I dick womb and stomach swell, my borough is dark
Many lights UFO kites, Benjamin Franklin got it right
Abraham I stuck your cherry tree
Your white head came out my black pussy
I ran Rip Van Winkle on all fours
Mountains twinkle twinkle star, Tarzan in a jar
And then came out Jane Flintstone in my gravel pit


Kill the chatterin, niggas bust shots, keep em scatterin
Blood splatterin, on point like a javelin
Fuck battlin, you cats is only good for babblin
Imaginin yourself, as the God space travellin
Round the seven rings of Saturn
Got my sword plus the Abbot in the chamber, nine in the clip
At the gatherin, we left you staggerin, yo it had to been
Hot Nickel, who broke bread, at the Vatican
Stick a pin, in a citizen, mental food, got us diggin in
My compliments to the chef
M-E-TH like amphatimens, yes stick it to the veteran
Blaow blaow! Blown to death, take your medicines
I put the sick in your mu-sick with Osirus
Bound to blow like a bad sinus


Stay up at night don't sleep on your morn
Rest in the day because it's sunlight
Reverse thought psychology


Child wild adventures walk trillions of square inches
Ten percentage try to drain me of my mental strengthage
Heavy wattage knowledge cleans blood clottage, and retardage
I refine the garbage logic exterminate your cottage


Thirty-six anger, dirty language is the stranger
The mangler, the honor roll singer righteous finger
When we shine-a, we always find a never minor major
Hard to spot we dangerous with our behavior


Australian Venezuelan illegal aliens
Chameleons all catch the feelings we revealing
Killer bee keep your mind at ease, lay back like Adam fuckin Eve
Four thousand years in the garden, puffin trees


I aim slang I maintain, through the main vein
The answer came clever, when we do greatness through trial and error
Mile of terror motor mouth, let the odour out
Fuming greater, the temper in my spine huminator
The super grass childish blast sleepy eye stash
The hashish masterpiece, Osirus is the virus
This split second splash, severe drop is near pop
There's falling teardrops, now is it worth your career?




We gon' take this back, crazy old school
Off the head one time, get a DJ something to a--
Chika-chika-chika-chika-chicka-chicka-chhhh

Irief Jamel, I rocks the mic well, well
Rock the mic well, well, well..


On and on, to the break of dawn
Hot Butter on, say what? The popcorn
Freak 'em to the left, while we rock 'em to the right
Brooklyn in the house, who wanna fight?
Can we bounce? Roll to the skate, ya rock?
Hip to the hop and ya don't dare stop
Come alive party people, gimme what you got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
Fine, I'm the ninth member of the bunch
Rockin' old school ain't shit to me
MC's OD on the shit that I wrote
Can we smoke while I'm drinkin'? I'm thinkin' of bonin'
Sugar, I wanna ride yo ass until the mornin'
Leave ya moanin: Jamel Irief, High Chief, comin' outta East Medins


Ladies in the house if ya clockin' Gs
Sippin' on drink, Long Island Iced Teas
Lookin' real good from ya toes to ya weave
Tell the fellas back up and like let ya breathe
Fellas in the house if ya know ya live
Punch niggas in the face from Cali to Bed-stuy
Handlin' the steel if the shit get real
Just flip a pie and stack ya mil'


Activation, mind starts sparkin'
Constant elevation, sky walkin'
David Thompson, my Wu niggas stompin'
Down the boulevard, shakin' yo ass
You better watch yo self, I'm type slick
With a nice size --- lemme see you work it
She wanna suck it in public
Ol' Dirty Bastard can use it on the visitings, you wit it?
Then holla like wheels on a peel, don't squeal
Just keep it on the 'lils, for the Masta Kill
Just givin' you somethin' that y'all can feel
I see you in the hood, then ya fam from Tilden
Slid through the back of the buildin', heat concealed in
Stare to your place
Rae bomb the elevator, an Incarcerated Scarface, here, taste
The lace from the dominant race to the base
In ya face like paste, baby doll
Uh, uh, uh, uh, yes yes y'all
Welcome to the block party, shots lick off
You might wanna hit the deck, but stay calm
It's only us, every thing's still well plush
We freakin' the streets, the Shiek shows the beat 


One two, one two
I'mma try this one more time, son
Lemme in there, yo put that nigga back son
(Yeah, hit hard)


Like... hip hop, like socialize
Clean out ya ears and ya open ya eyes
Liquid Sword to the city
Peace Allah Just, that's one of the committee
Let's hook up the 6 for a chess contest
Relieve a little stress
I'll snatch a bag of the Uptown's best
Make ya love it when ya smell it
It's the velvet, block of chocolate for a hundred
Dread' got pounds, if ya wanna get down
Or we can catch 'em on the next round
My universal sound is like world reknowned
World reknowned, world reknowned
My universal sound is like world reknowned 





Uh huh...
Ayo feet planted
Eyes slanted, grand peripheral


Extraordinary banda individual
Standin' at the manda that's the dismissable
Peace to the nation, got patience to sing to you
To the two one puttin' truth in the lines
In the booth with glass orange juice to the lime
Ballin' must play hoops all the time, Spaldin' bounce put the boost
In her spine, had to give her a reason to rewind
So you ain't got to... tell her slide through
Pop bottles with models and hit the drive through
Karma suited for kamasutras, spanish models with the somber movements
One two like I stomped to it and uncut like without condom usage
R-A-W, eh what the fuck is you doin'? (Nothin)
Selling them lines to the kids


A nigga gotta live
A nigga gotta live
A nigga gotta live
A nigga gotta live
A nigga gotta live


Ayo hot low, asshole, on my own shit
Been back but no one smokin' on the cig
Gotti flow got little shawty blow clips
Snotty nosed kid, now the crop since kid karate rhymes(?)
Young ridin' hypha got the party loud like a twenty five to life
Fresh out the cypha surfin' line like slung coke
So came by the ocean on the coast or open on a dope overdose
It's over dosage, so sleep, no sweat techniques, no joke
One toke smoking on the best trees, floatin' in the sea
Back strokin', till the river runs dried up, spill a loogy young blu-ey
Got the fire, he provide every came your supplier
Liars hangin' on telephone wires, the B-L-U in the...
What the fuck is you doin'? (Nothin) Sellin 'em lines to the kid


A nigga gotta live
A nigga gotta live
A nigga gotta live
A nigga gotta live
(The world is ours)
A nigga gotta live
(The world is ours)
A nigga gotta live
(Say it louder)
A nigga gotta live
(Fight the power)
A nigga gotta live
(The world is ours)

What the fuck y'all birds talking about?
Get the fuck out my house
'Fore I grab you by your hair and slap dick to your mouth
Bob Digi, yeah you know who is he
Girl, I fucking slave trade your ass like Kizzy Kinte
(But wait, fuck you motherfucker)
You wish you could fuck
Bitch, all you can do is dick suck
(Your ass can't fuck, that's why your wife left your monkey ass)
Fuck that, you don't cook, you don't clean, or press my jeans
You don't scrub or wash clothes
Or buy food for making (???), bitch
You don't read to the seeds
All you do is watch tv and smoke weed
Get your nails done and feet, scrub the hairweave
Sleep all day, eat, gain weight, can't breathe
Talking about you're going to leave?
Then bitch leave! What the fuck you're waiting for?
Hit the door, I ain't taking this shit no more!
Spending all my cream on Gucci, Phillies and Coach
Before you moved to my lab, bitch, I ain't never seen a roach
Stains on my carpet, bathroom's more like a fish market
Take all the space in my closet, where the fuck's your logic?
Disrespecting my old earth, aborted my child birth
And every day I catch my credit card inside your purse
You can't speak a sentence without a curse
Talking 'bout you're going to be a nurse
Bitch, to be a nurse you got to go to shool first!
When I first met you, you was a ho
I tried to reform you, bomb you, warn you and teach you
But couldn't reach you, and you're still a ho
Your father said you was a ho
And when you leave me, bitch you're gonna be a ho
Celluloid and gargoyle feet, I'd rather beat my meat
That raggy ass pussy a starving dog wouldn't eat
Started with the body of a model
Pussy tight as a pharmaceutical bottle
And you could swallow a whole avocado
And two forty ounce bottles
To the end of the world, which to I would follow
Now, when I fuck you, the shit echos cause you pussy is so hollow
Turn your fat ass sideways
Your stretch marks are like the US highways
Fuck a new nigga every friday
Talking 'bout bust a nut, bitch I'll bust yo guts!
(You come so quick nigga)
Wonder why I come so quick?
With that wide ass pussy and soggy tits?
I'm trying to get the shit over with, and go to sleep!
But when I'm with my real freak on the weekend
Bet that baby we fuck for two and a half hours or three
You'd better study the 1-14 knowledge culture degree
About M-G-T, and G-C-C


Cause you ain't shit, and your mother ain't shit
And your sister ain't shit, and your pussy ain't shit
That weave ain't shit, your ass ain't shit
Girl you ain't shit, your daddy ain't shit


But fuck it, yo, let me get this fucking phone
Yeah, get the motherfucking phone
Quit motherfuckers in our fucking
Business. End the fuck, or I'll pull
The motherfucking chord out of the
Man, fuck that motherfucking socket
Yo God, this bitch is bugging I'm sick of this shit motherfucker

Fuck you, yo God, my bitch... shit. Fucking dirty toilet seats and

We'll be back son Now that's right, tell that
We'll be back motherfucker to call you back
Cause you ain't going to steal
This motherfucking phone




By the time I'm finished, you gon' be a fan, muthafucka
Trust me when I tell you


I kick back, retire mics, take rap to higher heights
Big back, fiend rap, blow it up, dynamite
Sniff my China white, touchdown with king cobras
All my life, pay the price, nickname me steamroller
Switch lane, lean over, get brain, green Rover
Mean soldiers run through, kung fu, break shoulders
Rep my W, rumble through, takeover
Heat holder, heavy best, countdown, every breath
Last chance, tapdance, devil cop, every step
Murderous, instinct, champions, never left
Shaolin veteran, thug heads, never learn
Dumb shit, every turn, hell, son, let 'em burn
Still here, standing firm, black man in progress
Crack dreams, conquest, burners in my arm rest
Baby boy's a target, heads on my cannonball
You messed up the package, the legacy, you had it all

"Come on"
"Come on"


Sandstorms, kick up, millimeters blow rounds
What happened to the music, Newburgh, Motown
I know the low down, on half of these niggas
Come out the closet, these Vaseline niggas
I'm flawless, I'm lawless, all I need is one block
Crazy legs, hat low, check out my up rock
Respect my jumpshot, when I just, hug the rim
Tie up my Jordans, then I jump, out the gym
It's the Brothers Grymm, automatic coke rush
Dice hit the walls, we gambles at the gold dust
Descendants of the Cold Crush, long car garage doors
One finger cake walk, nose is the concord
Hands like windmills, possessed with the ill skill
Aiming for your soft spots, the scene out of Kill Bill

"Come on"
"Come on"


I got the iron for your mans, one foot in the frying pan
Rock hardhats, fireman, 8 Diagrams
Lion eating out my hands, no it's not in Africa
Soul brother #1, you're just a passenger
Right before the massacre, first comes the lynching
Caught in the mouse trap, bounce back, Redemption
Contact the henchmen, watch how I drenched them
Wetting with waterhose, long nose extention
Ain't no question, you in suspended animation
You fucked up, drop garbage tossed the side of sanitation
Homey, you jumped up, you get lumped up, blamp your face in
Champ in the steel cage match, snatch the foundation back
Step on a forty gallon stage, laced with ill grace
Took a long time, but I'm glad that you still wait

"Come on"
"Come on"




If you don't want the drama, bust your gun
You don't want the drama, here I come
You don't want the drama


Top chrome spin, whirlwinds, microphone's bend
Some grown men, moan when they sold they soul to sin
Unfolded with thin lies, the aura to make the papermate fry
You escaped fate, watch the snake eyes
Pre-heat the oven guides, now watch the cake rise
Eight size gorillas in the background, clap rounds
Back down, on July 4th in Chinatown, it's how the mack sounds
Clown I'm a pound, you're a half-pound
Scratched out, names from the guest list, treacherous
Wreckless, the death kiss, die with a deathwish
Expect this, underwater flow to leave you breathless
My sentences structured to rupture your laser discs
Razors in my fist, swing til I can't swing
Do my damn thing, guns don't jam when I bang


I went through concrete and bars, still hit the god damn tar
The love of money got me wanting the car
It's obvious that the game won't change, I still slang crack cocaine
Got a full plate in front of me
Son I gotta eat, no kids to feed
So I gotta cop something new for my feet




Double tactics, smoke niggas out like crack addicts
Face, pass it, I storm out wild, straight jurassic
My habits: drink liquor, smoke weed, get bent backwards
I play the lab, cuz I might spaz with ill fashion
Crashin' all ya M.C.'s rep and drop classics
Ya'll pretty boppin' get holes right your satan
It's peace and clackin', keep it dirty in the stashin'
You push me, homey, have your body layin' in Manhattan
Yeah, I'm from Staten, where the streets talk, the block listen
That's why I keep the gauge loaded 4/5 in the kitchen
Three eighty in my waist, I ain't playin' what I'm sayin'
Have your whole shit replaced, in broad day
So I keep it low, had to stop coppin' from Broadway
Ya'll phony niggas know you to slow to face me
Get a taste of the young g, with the case of the Old E'
When I shave the goatee, from frontin' with me




It's time, to set it off, master of metaphors
You heard of this predator, Stoneface Skeletor
Knocked down for ten long yards, I'm still standin' tall
Ready for war, let it flow like the reservoir
Dough in my treasure drawer, spit out my cannon ball
Run for the embersole, yeah, I could handle ya'll
Verses got many more, damage any challenge or
Catch me splurgin' at the Virgin MegaStore
Strong arm the dance floor, what more can you ask for?
Dashin' bachelors, and let you fry the circuits
I die for a purpose, behind the iron curtain
I'm, puttin' my work in, at the same time the Earth spin




You don't want to fuck with me




I don't know where to begin, or where to start
All I know is I broke my mother heart
It started way back with a little weed
Then it grew into acid, coke and speed
I became that monster with a need to feed
Was it greed? No, I just needed to freeze
Then I dibbled in this, then I dabbled in that
Then the next thing you know, I was exposed to crack
And I guess curiosity killed the cat
And the way that it look, ain't no turning back
And I used to have the hook up, g'sll splurge
Now, I just cook up to feed my herbs
Now, people just look up, like he's the third
Cuz he walk around town like he's a bird
Instead of money it was drugs that he prefered
Say no to the substance, heed my words


I don't love the drugs, drugs love me
It's the coke, and the weed, and the ecstasy
It's a terrible disease, that go down down deep
And all day long it be calling me


My father, he had dope fiend arms
Lord, thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus for moms
Damn, I did her wrong, not a pot to piss in
And the, TV's missing, couldn't stop the addiction
Damn, that cause friction, I broke the trust
Huh, how could I tell her that I smoked it up
And I smoked the red dust, to fight the demons
And I need a head rush, cuz tonight I'm fiending
Not for the nicotine, the pipe I'm screaming
And the monkey on my back, can't fight the feeling
And I did a robbery, I broke the clip
And I caught a lottery ticket and smoked the dip
Life fucked up, nigga, I choked my bitch
Police tried to cuff me and I broke the stick
I'm as low as I can get, low as I can get, nigga
Low, low, need another hit, nigga




I love getting high, throwing dick to dames
Lived life to the fullest like my name Rick James
I don't know what's more addictive, the chicks, the fame
Damn, I done shamed my family name
One foot in the rain, one foot in the flame
Ugh, rich or poor, whatever you call it
I'm a cigarette smoker, two sips from alcoholic
Got to change my ways, flush drugs down the toilet







Bear witness to the god, young thugs don't live long
Life is a game of chess (and you playin the pawn)
I be the king, listen to the knowledge I born
Walk a righteous path, you can never go wrong

Yo east New York, Schenectady, this kid live next to me
Manifest his destiny, to specialize in treachery
Subliminal, wanted to be nuttin, but a criminal
Wit braids, and doo-loo dropped out the eight grade
Tradin rocks, mad obsessed wit guns, was infected
Should of came amongst gods, could of been resurrected
He expected to live long, holdin the Glock
Never opened up his lessons, never took the salat
Robbed a liquor store, the old man knew him since four
Still slapped him wit the toast, and son emptied the cash drawer
Watchin news flicks, what the kid did, gettin famous
Found the owner in the back of the store, left brainless
The stainless was found, in the sewer three blocks down
The DE's flashed his picture around the Polo Grounds
Kicked his grandmother door down, wit a search warrant
Hand cuffed him in his boxers, tipped off by an informant
He was sentenced to thirty-two, Y Equality
Allah rules, he should of listened to his jewels

Chorus 2x

Young thugs don't live long
Life is a game of chess, and you playin a pawn
I be king, listen to the knowledge I born
Walk a righteous path, and you can never go wrong (word up)



This be the dance of the drunken, nigga found slunken
Over the steering wheel with one to his head, black
All those he drove his next destination of home
Suddenly sniped from civilization
Reality starts to set in, his last thoughts
Flashin back to where it all begun
A shorty who slung for a militant soldier
Who made his bones by holdin down the corner
Never turned snitch even though he was pinched by the Feds
He held his weight and did a bid
Of two to six, as he sat from his cell wit a vengence
He held in his heart like a icepick
Physically, he's cut the fuck up
Tryin to maintain but his head is fucked up
To learn, the word on the streets confirmed
Of the sickness, murderin a family member that turned informant
He signed this in a moment of silence
He broke it, this lead to bloodshed and violence



This chick Iris out in Queens had a cocaine Lexus
Dime sexes, she rock a leather G necklace
Building reckless, Queen kingpin deathwish
Hit women that'll fuck you and return them the essence
This evil widow, she pulled a fo'-fo' out the pillow
Wit a silencer, la cosa nostra cats, they admired her
They hide a force sting to hit the North Region king of teamster
Head C.E.O. of, a major ring but one thing
Lead to another, a leaf, blew her cover
She got side-swiped, tied up,  he buck fifty cut her
He shot her both knees then, dumper her in the gutter
It was gory, the top nigga tortured her for glory
But, he let her live so she could about this story




AW SHIT!
Now I got you tremble'n for the battle to begin
I'm not gonna leave this place with no sad face
Cuz I'm gonna win
The battle everybody in the world just came to see
Golden Arms, (ah!) take out these cornwalled ass MC's
All y'all corns - walk out the door (ah!)
You run the same rhyme that the crowd don't wanna hear no more
Gun blastin this and flashin that, reality now actually

We came here (we came here), to dull the bass (ha, ha, ha)
And Mathematics catch the cut while RZA Ra just hold the bass
And I'm rhyme and on timin', it's so fresh from out the pack
Niggas got problems, cuz the Wu is fighting back
Please don't sing (please don't sing), yo battle rap (ha, ha, ha)

Yo, Yo, Watch out! They let the hell out the gates


Now then, the Cheesaw have four chiefs
Number one is Golden Arms






You stepped in the pit of the flame
You're lost on Beat Street, I'mma throw spit on your name
Hear the roar when they mention the name
It's like Mike when he score with like two seconds left in the game
Small change don't step in my lane
I rock too hardbody, I click-bang, give 'em the pain
Nah man, can't get with them games
Your boy born with it, so how you gon' get him to change
You a lame putting shit in the game
Piranha wanna see me in the state greens and prisoner chains
But I'm smooth like the groove to the listener brain
And you only understand it if you been through my pain
Icy white spitters in frames
Hustle in my blood, bet my seeds gon' get it the same
Yes indeed I'm destined to reign, so ahead of the game
All aboard y'all get on the train


Banana clip Mac-aholic, I slap your cap then join
Go in the freezer, got a skeezer tits out the toilet
Niggas is Norbits, running up on a dice game, call it
Preacher suit on, holding a raw fifth
Put that call in, his dough in the wall, stall him
Plastic bags laying in the floorway, yep
It's just dog's day, reservoir out in Utah, yo
Where my dope and marijuanas got bought in
Real Nikes, afford 'em, we pay to have a roast
Assassins is strapped, this the only way the yay grows
More leverage, more sevens, riding around with legends
Paying judges off, we be up in New York repping


Miramax movie magic, cold beer on tap, rumor has it
Words put ideas on track
Footprints, I walk on Earth and appear on maps
Strive for at least 2.5 mill a year on cap
Wu Wear on my cap, dime piece on the lap
Three hundred push-ups a day put the crease on your back
Be the cap-fitting lieutenant black man
Who invented chopping samples up, to make the beats that's ascended to
Every genre of music, the whole sphere of music
I produced, arranged, engineered the music


My ear candy been dope, my pen stroke like Zorro
Hit the heavy bag like Foreman in the Congo
Mini transmitter, night vision in the stronghold
Rock long robes, smell snakes with a strong nose
Every time the horn blow the Wu signal's back on
Transform, pack form, a whole 'nother platform
We coming back for 'em to smash the spot, kid
I'm on your team too, pass me the rock
Til the casket drop I'mma flip your wig
Rip clothes, honey didn't know my dick this big
You get kicked in the ribs with two chrome gauge
Deadly venom, I send 'em back to stone age




You know it's all about (fame, fame)
You know it's all about (fame)


I'm a winner in my book
Lean Cuisine in the kitchen, the fly cook
In the air like Kareem and the sky hook
Def juxt, my left hook
This is easy work
The mic mechanics, see the greasy shirt
This is easy perks
Photo 2-stepped out of the chopper
My bitch know she cute
Manolo boots keep cussin' at the hustlers
How you gon' get loot, you're cussin' out the customers
No sales, you better have my cash
If the feds don't grab me, I got lots of plans
I'll need goals, the all-star cast
In the leading role, call it cruise control
Everything is shakable, everything is takable
No chinks in my armor, I'm feeling unbreakable
Swimming through the sharks tank, I'm top rank for the


(Fame)
For the (fame)
For the (fame)
For the (fame)
For the (fame)
For the (fame)


On my arm I draw ink, resemble war tank
The glass tipper, spilling up more drink
All I do is think of ways to smash 'em
Eyes on me, rise for the anthem
Rings like Green Lantern in the green Phantom
Talk of the town, "Don't he look handsome?"
You're little league, you owe me major debt
It's the takeover, I'm cashing European checks
Brush your teeth, I'm your early morning toothache
Stomp the roach, this is how my boot taste
Cotton candy, hot sippin' brandy
Pass me my suitcase you skinny pants fruitcake
Listen to the grime when it's mixed with crime
A dozen of my rhyme books, you're stalkin' on my timeline
From the foul line back to the huddle
Writin' tracks on the bullet train to the shuttle for the




Raised by wolves like the book by Prevario
Did a lot of dirt but never would say sorry though
Wild like the latin boys down in El Barrio
Crook on the juxt then you better do your cardio
Run to him or run from him
He's a killer so you can't take his gun from him
He bagged coke so his hands feel numb from him
He's a cold-hearted bastard, better dumb dumb him
Preferably a .45, my job is making sure
If they violate the big man, the little shorty ride
Out in the stretcher in the ambalance
Me, I let the hammer blam for niggas
Moving grams on the hand to hand
If I'm talking snow, it's a avalanche
I ain't thinking of rap, catch me in the battle stance
Yeah it's the Ghost, motherfucker
Guns, rappers and blunts, yeah I smoke motherfuckers


Check out my drunk dance, the Killah Hill redbone
Put that on my headstone, you see the gemstone?
Caught it in the endzone, headphones Dr. Dre
The new sensation, yeah I got a lot to say
Let him speak, he's so misunderstood
Let him speak, the new voice of the hood
Never had the hype, always had the heart
Keep it simple and sharp, then I land on the charts for the






I'm sayin, you-could-you could just come over top of that shit...
Did I hear it?
Nigga and bang your head, PUNK!!

 *in background repeating*
SUCK A DICK!!! 6x
SUCK MY DICK!!!


And it don't, it don't, it don't, it don't, it don't, it don't
It don't, it don't, it don't, it don't stop!
It all starts wit the pad and pen, shall we begin
To burn bush in this rap session, once again
On the run be the Black Stallion
Now you fuckin wit Ticallion, hmmm
Iron Lung, boy me can done, army of one, blaze yo' bun
I'mma get you none, accept challenge AHH!
Run a mile wit a racist, they iced it, I aced it
Placed it, right up in their face till they faced it
Hard to the dome like a chrome microphone
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bad to the bone to the bone
Danger zone, that's my life and my song
Keep it movin, hop along little doggies!


Uh uh uh, FUCK YOU!!!
Drive The Mack Cadillac
Dark shade the window all sunny and black
Pitch antenna back of the car
Inside is a TV, even a bar
Bulletproof down, safe and sound
Chauffeur in the FRONT just to drive the Lexus all around
Give ya, give ya, give ya body a ride, nice and warm inside
Come to the Dirt Dog as the tummy rise
*Laughs* Enter


Yo yo my Wu-Tang cliff'll make your atom split
The power of my brain, you can't fathom it
Whoever go against the will of the grain will get slain
Don't EVER say thy God name in vain
My third eye electronic dragonfly spiral observe
Can record your words
And your lies and approach you
And have my Dogs come and Ghost you
When it comes to the bread son, the heat will toast you


Music makes me lose control
This is not just rock and roll
Hip hop digs right to the soul
Music makes me lose control
Wu-Tang, now we on a roll
On a rise, now here we go
Guaranteed to flip the show
RZA beats is outta control
Outta control, outta control, outta control
Outta control, now here we go


Yo who got that nigga gassed like he can't get skimasked
Abducted from his doorstep
Dufflebag his head for the price of nothin
He's a glutton
What I'm manifestin each day is a lesson
Ya'll faggots, came to the School of the 36 Chambers
Copied on papers of scholars that earn dollars
We trendsetters in Wu leathers, trendsetters in Wu leathers, whatever

Chorus  2x
Music makes me lose control
This is not just rock and roll
Hip hop digs right to the soul
Music makes me lose control
Wu-Tang, now we on a roll
On a rise, now here we go *Skip next line on the second time of chorus*
Music makes me lose control (2x)

Guaranteed to rip the show
RZA beats is outta control
Outta control, outta control, outta control
Now here we go




George Peppard


I whip cause I sprung shit, bang, heres a bung hit
Cats split your tongue, shit, bitch got cum sick
She can keep the knee pads, sign for the helmet
Man vibrations, coming off the pelvis
Thugs and prescription drugs, yo, wheres Elvis?
Pull off the panties, she was smelling like a shellfish
Gung when we rung shit, that run, here we come, spit
Eyes on the gunship, heh, heres your Blistex
Heres a spliff twist, hanging out the window like a rhyme smith
Now you taking flicks of my footprint
Sunshine and dough ride just like a biscuit
Live wire, no installation is required
One match, I set the world on fire
Live wires, no installation is required
One match, I set the world is fire


The God said to put the fire on it
The God said to put the fire on it
One match, we set the world on fire
One match, we set the world on fire


Its the art of war combat, every move is high tech
Human Terminator nigga, plug me into SkyNet
Red bone, hot head, burnt down my projects
I turn sound into killing flying objects
Blood off contracts, kill em on contact
Yeah, I got bread, dead? Nope, not yet
Damn, you aint pop yet, haters wanna block that
Snatch mics, hunchback, talk smack, I punch back
Flew off the launchpad, right through your insides
Great minds combine, try to study my enzymes
Skating on the thin line, fighting for the airtime
Push back your hairline, with shots of tequila lime
Stay on my global grind, talk with a sober mind
Putting in more overtime, till I reach a billion
In the condominium, skinny tall Brazilian
With so many tats, she looking reptilian




My hand hot, killer, curry in the pot, killer
Look how these killers thinking they are and they not, killers
I get the drop, killer, all the killings stop, killer
My heavy hitters flex on everyone you got with ya
This tracks not filler, talk with my hands, Im tryna feel ya
It might be the fact that we not familiar
Or, not La Familia, a monkey with bars
You not gorilla, Zilla, calling you Don, my pen has gotten iller
Yeah, you know who we are, you know the slums
Where the women keep the wook in they bra, thats where Im from
Cops catch you with the rook in the car, this where you run
You can die here, son, and the ambulance never come, ugh
Aint no limit till I spit it, my Yankee fitted
Shout out to critics that know Im wicked for killing minute
Shout out to rappers that aint committed, but think they get it
Hold up, now wait a minute, let me put some hating in it






Lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl

Lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl


Aiyyo, who can test I, the true King of N.Y
Well ever since Big Boy died from Bed-Stuy
I've been, controllin the street, holdin the heat
Shit I only want what's stolen from me (Nah you ain't fuckin wit us)
Rollin with me, could only get you fast cars and
Fuck mad bitches and, dine amongst the stars
But we gettin mad chave in the life we live
MTV's comin over just to feel my "Crib"
Man fuck them other kids! That's how I feel
I thought I said it all in "He's Not Real"
But you beggin me to kill, must want ya brain spilled
I tryna keep cool but it's hard to tame still
Shit's still real man you never shoulda bought it
Must feel ill to see your boss get extorted
Specialize in audits and makin hot tapes
This rap shit don't cut it then it's back to flippin weight
Man I'm feelin great (Whoo!) Pushin mad units
Hustlin is the key to success but could you do it
I been layin it down, the spray and the town
It's about time the rightful owner claimed his crown


Lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl

Lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl


Yo, I hit 'em up with the snubs, puff the bigger buds
So sinister, a John Dillinger, yeah, I've been a thug
Fire all cylenders, swing with gritty love
Smooth talk, watch a moonwalk up in the club
I'm like Michael Jackson without the glitter glove
Go get it for sure, that's right, a jitterbug
A minister of death, came back to finish ya
At the tip of the missile, a fish, you been a scud
That's right, it's in my blood, damn, what's in them drugs
They make you spit slugs, leave marks in the floor
Yo, I stomp through the yard, I march through the hall
Charles Bronson them hard, Jack Johnson your jaw
If I sell out, yo, I'm copping some more
Get the hell out, or I'm popping the four


While I'm lookin' at the life I left, it's kinda hard not to hate myself
But quiet as kept, right or wrong it's just the way I felt
I might be better off prayin' for death, on my knees I knelt
Still tryin' to find a way to accept, it ain't a way that I can
Help nobody, 'til I save myself, techinically I'm still a slave myself
I gotta climb out the grave myself, man I played myself
But when I look at all the fans I touched
I ask how can a man that's done so much, be treated so unjust
Cause I'm tryin' to inspire the folks, you wanna be them
Cause they sell dope, well man show 'em the ropes
Be a father or a football coach, a role model or a symbol of hope
Take another approach, instead of testifyin' aganist them in court
Handcuffin' 'em and closin' the door, so they can be worse than before
Can't you see they only do what they know


Lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl

Lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl


Aiyo, my wiz play the flute, I stroll through the forest like
Peace, pussies, trees, hello, how was your day? Have you seen the prince?
Haven't seen him since he pushed Humpty Da-Dumpty fell off the fence
The smurfs fell out laughin', Heckle toe Jeckle at min
They took my medicade card, he's a good friend
Bugs still sniffin', Daffy Duck snitchin'
And heard that crazy Bird took the stand on the Simpsons
Bet you "my golly, oh glory" with a story to tell
Droopy got knocked, now he Muslim in jail
His name is Abdrul, Colorful, Snow White tattoo
She used to send him mad flicks in Cash Rule
And the cat too, old girl who's clackin' her shoes
And that wicked witch broke her broom, clappin' at school
It happens every night, I seen it, shoot outs in Jellystone Park


Well I'm sitting on the goal line, staring at the game clock
Facing a hundred years, 'member Jordan had the same shot
Carolina blue, California green
Jump for the white, get yo' frilly sheets
Ace Hood they go crazy when I'm in your city
Ace Hood, that's what they sayin in every city
I put my team first, we never reheard
We the best franchise cause it's squeeze first
Start the life where I give to the G-code
Drafted outta high school then I hit my free throws
You see them free shows, we call them free throws
Now it cost em 20 stacks just to witness me flow
Chea, on the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things


Lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl

Lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own) girl




The gang'll feel, we a gang of gangstas
A gang of gangstas.. what up
I might bang this steel, we a gang of gangstas
A gang of gangstas.. up
The gang'll feel, we a gang of gangstas
A gang of gangstas.. what up
I might bang this steel, I might bang this steel
We a gang of gangstas.. what up


I ain't really talkin' to niggas, I don't know
And I ain't gotta floss to licked by your ho
I place slow in the precint, fightin' off the chokehold indecent
Try'nna give me the talk, but I won't fold this g, shit
Parental discretion advised, advice for my advisaries
Get a weapon and ride, Ice comin' soon
With a hundred goons who all love to shoot shots
Put a tunnel through your coupe, slump your baby mother too
All's fear and warfare, that got my team in the crosshairs
The gleem left them blind, it seems they all scared
Want to get money but your heart ain't there
Your mind ain't writin', the drugs got you lost in fear
Luv Allah, you in this for the broads, or you wanna ball
M.O.E., I've seen money seperate dogs
Cut your life short with the four four long, real talk
Lose this game, you die, hid confined behind them steel bars


I'm an animal damn it, slash bandit, slash cannibal
Grand it like Hannibal, slash Marilyn Manson
Tattoo's, duck tape, snatch dudes for ransom
Hundred bricks' of jewels, let me choose a mansion
Kill crews, bullet shoes are stampin'
Straight dogs are dampin', the spirit of you so called champions
My pen is a pillage in Hamptons, wherever you camped in
Ya'll all tied up, you and your damn friends
You better get 'em pies up, homey's kill kids
And everything around you, so you can feel it
Don't take it lightly, this is some real shit
That Hill shit, duck when I spill clips, your real bitch
You not real right, you're ready rock, a real prick
And ya'll don't know how it feel, when them things hit
You will never know how it feel, when them things hit
You won't even hear it comin, cuz it sounds like spit
*spit* *spit* It sound like spit
Now what sound like this, but a pound in my hit
Silencer on the battle, plus I rubber the grip
On the barrel, plus I rubber the grip


I lay it thick to bitches, like big dicks picture this
You battlin' me for chips, throwin' your best lines
Passin' to me spit, I'm throwin' my worst lines
And still empty the clip, take over your whole ship
Your soldiers are bullshit, talkin' you got a gun
But son, you ain't usin' it, play dumb
You slung by the force of the bullets
For sure I'm gonna pull it, sixteens in your unit
The flagolent never prove it
I'm a beast to this music, and increase in the streets
Cop heat to abuse it, I'm toyin' wit ya'll
Young boys with no choice but to follow the rest
I swallow your best, technique and tactic
Couldn't last one round, be careful it's the draft picks
Niggas get gun downed, get married to they caskets
It's easy to see, when I sing, ya'll back it
Make me have the plate, talk slick, get ya ass kicked (what up)




Although I told the son, shine in the darkness, fuckin' with a cat that's heartless
Barely cuz my gun jam, or cuz I use a Glock with one or two revolvers
Twenty two in the ankle, or the Glock, nine in the hostler
In the street, 57 rips the meat right off your shoulder
When I do it, just look at my eyes they're ain't no fear
A minute ago you was holdin', now it's rather this
Fuck runnin' up in it, with the pockets off the denim
Take the cash out the shines, then I'm splittin'
Niggas say I'm chippin', but I'mma trynna make a livin'
Picture me livin' in the streets, I'd rather go to prison
Three hot, send the cop, fuck that
It's 16 hot in his Glock, ski mask, black gloves, hit a number spot
I hit the lotto without usin' the ticket
Ask me how stupid muthafucka, just spit
Cuz I'm livin' the street life..


I'm slick with my notes, move quick on my cults
Talk slick money grip? I'm slittin' your throat
Cop a house on the boat, twenty pounds of coke
Catch him at the Puerto Rican parade on the top of the float
Curry don't need alligator shoes or a furry coats
Play me close, I gave him a dose
Shot him up with volts, body go up in the smoke
The mic pope is back, I throw him in the yoke
Head crack, go for broke, nigga, murder he wrote
I took her to the crib, we fucked like old folks
Death stroke, hand on my balls, got you in a scope
I punch you so hard, got you stuck between the ropes
Thunderbolts under the blow, shake the ass, vocals show
We comin' for war, it's your hope, when my
Tech will blow, it effects your hearin'
When the game need penicilen, inject the serum
It's the livest borough in the headphone portable
The last mentioned niggas in the hip hop quotable


My brain cells are excersized, dismember your body
Leave you hard to recognize, check the size of the shotty
Eyes foggy from purple haze blunts, surgicul blade graze chumps
I open flesh, leave no razor bumps
And made this jump up to the sound of frantic gun fire
Sware, don't stare, or get aired like spare tires
Now you wear wires you government informant
I sign your death warrant, your expired without life insurance
I'm equipment with a high performance engine
The heater stays hot, so now my palms are sinked into the Glock
My attention's worth to stop your heart from beating
Sink your teeth into the bullet for beefin', now you're permament sleeping
Pleadin' after I'm Charman squeezin', the desert e'zin
You'll be restin' in pieces, that's the opposite of breathin'
Receiving head trauma from an infrared llama
Son I'm half Dave Berkowitz and half Jeff Dahmer


Come on... rap on hold, I'm try'nna get movie cream
So my rims'll be bigger than movie screens
Ask if I make you cock-eyed, and my flow is lethal
Grow on sight, swallowin' peroxide
Dudes try to kill the sire, due that
Get put on the floor like wheels in tires
Look, put the pedal to the metal, don't stop
I'm like a tea kettle, little daddy, I'm hot
Straight blazin', amazin', Ja-Mal, amazin'
Blazin', you sort of get the idea
Beef, finish it, can't afford to start it
Get your face stepped on like floors and carpets
P. Diddy who did he when the son don't shine
Gun shots is plenty, clips is all empty
Minds filled with envy, love assassin me
That's why they call me Lord, your title is type iffy
Put this over your fit, I'm ready for violence
Grab a gun, a knife or a home appliance, Ja-Mal!






I'm a bonified g, g, g, g, g, g (Chea, chea, chea, chea)
I'm a bonified g, g, g, g, g (Chea, chea, chea, chea, come on)
I'm a bonified g, g, g, g (Where ya at? East coast, west coast)
Vicious, vicious, viciously (come on!)


Get down, get down, brah', I'm in your town, brah'
That's how we do it, I'm a stone cold rider
And now, I bust a round off, I'm a survivor
This is how we do it, for you snake ass conivers around


For you conivers, bust a round
Look around, lay ass down with the fo' pound
Shady spots for eighty blocks
I keep a bitch eyes closed like Jamie Foxx
Off the chain, niggas saw I'm off the chain
Nigga, stay in ya lane, so I'm off your face
It don't stop, I'm on the block
Lickin' shots, with the twelve gauge
Hit a nigga up, have you rapping for the front page




When them 24's park, them big dogs bark
You don't wanna get down when them big dogs start
Moving through the crowd, making Glocks get loud
Lettin' suckers know we'll take yo town
Flip a little ass, stack a little cash
Quick on the smash, I'm always on the smash
What these niggas gon' do with the Wu and the Ru
Them Timbs and them chucks, gon' put it on them dudes




I'm down for the get down, earnin' my stripes
Hillside, real guys, burn burners for life
Put slugs through yo vest, or blood on my knife
Yo I'm up in here, where it at? Throw the dice
The chrome device, still layin' on my hip
Lettin' my nuts swing, we bang for the strip
I'm up in this bitch, I bounce around the west coast
Hollerin' at hoes, lookin' for the best smoke




I'm a gangsta-gangsta brah', straight up menace
And I don't stop shootin' til the clip is finished
Ya'll ain't heard about me, still a boy in the hood
AK in the trunk, brah', it's all good
One time try to gaffle, the work, no hassle
C.P.T., kingpin of the castle
It's Compton, you see the bulge in the waist
T-shirt go up, y'all about face, chea








At a young, young age, nothing was right
The dirt that I did, I did at night
I used to hustle for a ray of light
Yo, I thought you was my A-Alike
But your heart was cold made of ice, yup
If I could count all the women and the money I spent
And the fake muthafuckas, the money I lent
Y'all niggas all gon' pay the price
Y'all all gonna pay the price


I won't shed a tear, I will not cry
I'm tired of hand me downs, and getting by
Yo, I just can't get right, no
I just can't get right, no
When I'm gonna get mine, yo


Life's full of drama, secrets and lies
If you get screwed in the end, don't be surprised
Y'all all gonna pay the price
Cuz y'all all gonna pay the price
When I'm gonna get mine, oh
When I'm gonna get mine, yo
You keep asking me this, the questions is doubt
You can't trust no one, that's what this lessons about
Put the news through the wire, the message is out
You pissing me off, stressing me out, but


I won't shed a tear, I will not cry
I'm tired of hand me downs, and getting by
Yo, I just can't get right, no
I just can't get right, no
When I'm gonna get mine, yo
When I'm gonna get mines...




If you got it, light it up (8X)


Ain't no shook in 'em, Pyrex pots is hot, fiends is cooking 'em
Little niggas hugging the block, cops is booking 'em
Women hugging they purse when they spot the crook in 'em
Back when little J got shot, pops was whooping 'em
Little noses dripping with snot, ock, now look at 'em
The ghetto got a hook in 'em now, drugs, stay pushing 'em
Used to throwing dirt in these blunts, now, it's kush in 'em
Used to tell these chicks to shut up, now, he's shooshing 'em
Get cash, get that ass or put a foot in 'em
Iron Flag, flag that cab, Bedford and Put-e-nam
There ain't no puss in 'em, dick, dildo, or gush in 'em
Niggas still got that juks in 'em

 + (Raekwon)
If he front then we stomp 'em out (Get 'em out ya way pa)
If he drunk and he run his mouth (Get 'em out ya way pa)
If he front then we stomp 'em out (Get 'em out ya way pa)
(Get 'em out ya way pa, move, move, move)


I'm seduced by the chrome, it's a ruthless poem
It took a little time to get his juices going
Producers know him as the kid with the Iron Palm
Righteous hammer examine the firearm
Approach or get fired on, permanent chest scar
Empire Strikes Back, check out the Death Star
Bless y'all, wet y'all, do the impossible
Where I'm from we use dum-dums in the arsenal
Highly sparkable, get stretched off the knuckle check
Known to scuffle, I take it to the upper deck
Universal conquest, kung fu buckle vets
In a dufflebag, max yo, a couple techs
Give 'em ear hustle, Wu brand we programmed
Next time we dance, it won't be a slow jam
I fear no man, son you get lynched up
Nigga bitch get Frankenstein stitched up




Yeah, voice skipping off percussion
Give it to 'em how they love it, slow flow, deadly, beloved
All praise the daunting calm yet
So alarming, without a word being spoken
A thought with no voice, just a nod and a look
The contract was took, straight cash, off the books
A major pawn took a Don, look, he's armed
With a few black rooks from the heart of the Crook
Shook ones look while they hung him on Hercules hooks
They found his body near a shallow brook, escaped on foot
Switched the look up, out of state, he got the hook up
The flipped cake, thought lighter than the feather
Yet heavier than weight when my mindstate starts to break
Take cover over RZA instrumental
I'm damn near invincible, it's simple




Tell me, what are they like?
They got holes in the top, five round holes
While I was watching, this stranger, hit them
But his fingers went right through the bone
So then, they've... mastered it
It's some style of kung fu, you know it?
The Skeleton Claw




I was born and raised, in the ghetto
I was born and raised, in the ghetto
I was born and raised, in the ghetto
Listen to me, and just lay up


Park Hill Projects, one eight pound
Holding it down, that's the motto, 'lo goose and lottos
Blunts on the regular, O.G. style
I'm into old V's, swinging in cabs, slinging them OZ's
All I know is running in fiends' labs, hitting the green bags
Visualizing Chef in the green Jag's
Wait til I get on, the haters gonna hate it
In this corner, a rich young don with a crisp lab


*humming*
Brother, listen to me
Brother, listen to me
Listen to me, and just lay up
How do you make your bread in the ghetto?
How do you make your bread in the ghetto?


Hustling, hustle & flow
We make bread in the ghetto, by selling that crack
See niggas that make bread by busting the gat
Might stick a nigga up, stab him dead in his back
It's a dirty bread game, but we get through them stacks
Bread game, rather have bread than fame
Some sell pills and weed, it ain't no joke
Might sell anything as long as we not broke
So if you getting that bread, we be coming for your throat
It's crazy what a brother might do for the bread
Might violate parole til ya family is dead
We get bread in the ghetto, while we ducking the feds
I heard bread in the ghetto got a loaf on his head, come on


Brother, listen to me
Brother, listen to me
Listen to me, and just lay up
How do you get rid of rats in the ghetto?


Yo, yo, aiyo we ox 'em, duff 'em, stuff 'em in black bags
Torture them, toss 'em out the window with rift rafts
Cuz we don't take kindly to rats in the ghetto
Either your mouth stay shut or get slapped with the metal
Big fat rats get fried like porkchops for snitching
Get your ass hung like a wall clock
It's Tone Stark, Billy the Kid when the gun bark
A wire sticking out his shirt, he talking to NARC!


How do you raise your kids in the ghetto?
How do you raise your kids in the ghetto?
Feed one child and starve another
Tell me, tell me, and just lay up


We like brothers, we came from the same mothers
In the projects, under the same covers
Wore the same drawers, fucked the same whores
Rolled dice, kicked rhymes, did crimes in the same hall
Sprayed our names on the same wall
Yo, your kids knew my kids, your wiz knew my wiz
Now you caught up in music and showbiz
If that's what it is, then that's what it is
Run up in your crib, with twelve black brothers
That'll digest to live, die just to live
Some called us martyrs, some called us fathers
Run up in the club like the suicide bombers
We be the brothers, ready past lovers
Never wanna see us, blow, we not others
Somewhere in the competition, friends got lost
The money got flipped, your tables got crossed
Now you all caught up in that label talk
Brain dead in the grain of thoughts
With a name and a game that can change New York
We ate from the same fork, pop had the same thought *echo*




I tear the roof right off this mother (I give them ghetto gutter)
That venom, I put it (on you, I'll give them ghetto gutter)


In the big black Cadillac, no handles attached
Drunk off the super skunk, pass me a batch
My single's on the radio, turn it up blast
I'm comin' through, stomp it up, put it on smash
My Energizer bunny boo, how long can you last
She spazzed on my dashboard, I almost crashed
What more can you ask for? The honey or the cash?
But it's money over bitches when I hit her with the shaft




Rhinestone cowboys, ratchets on the waist
Cops roll by, blow the haze in they face
Heads in the staircase, fiendin' for the base
Almost made a sell but someone yelled out "Jake!"
Then I bailed out like I had on skates
Almost fell out, but I made it home same
Splash on some fragrance, grind on the Ave
Kid, I'm ghetto fabulous, when the news cameras flash




I got a project chicken, her head game is great
She part time stripper, she handles my weight
Liberian connection, stretch through out of state
With pure opium shipments, fresh from out the crates
She drive a brand new Lex', tan with no plates
Motor bay, predates, sell it for high rate
Let's go one time, baby, two to the brain
Legendary street weapon, back in the game








Yo, Inspectah Deck track
Break your back Yo

A message of a wreckage
50 shell hot track leaking out the Lexus
Eyes hot, Cyclops, cyborg boulders
Call shop of horrors, Lyric just smoking in my holster
Whip and boil, ?lugotan? hurricane the holler
Daily operation, bullet train tingle farther
8 seconds a scar your style wild buccaneer
Round table revolve around ten musketeer
Thank you, got all the riches
Think you poli with bitches
You could run the fuck opponent, gotten with the glitches
The swiftness, hit the spots that are vital
Shake the ground decent, like 3 sticks of dyno


My administration deceive the population
Start the next generation by artificial insemination
Contaminate stations, for music in the making
Concentration camps, Assassinate for industry domination
Abomination, The Competition and confrontation you mistaken
I'm a nuclear warhead bomb evasion
Extermination of the next man, when the Germans blazing
We burn this for occasions, regardless I see your expiration
Preparation your sweatin
I cassette deck and eject your selection for air time
Blow a hole through your brain so you can think with a clear mind
A redesign? of hard rhyme, and slang cracking in spare time


Crime Time
We rollin with the undisputed, routin toutin
21 gun solutin, new recruiting
Wu-Tang, slang bang your unit
Put us in your cassette deck, yo, improvement
Smash and blast the shit, I'm doper than math
That makes you level through the devil
And never surpass
The stakes is hot, like bullet snatch pots
And hot twats
Fully operational gats mmhmm
The uncanny, vilagialaty panty man
Crock, took by the hook of the candy man
Look, now you caught up in the suction
Rap Tight and my appetite destruction


Today's day, The bomb gets dropped on America
Human civilization in concert treble concentration camps
Replacement amps blown, Speaker abduction
The Mad weed seduction corruption
From The brain cells decreasing
Its sucker duck season. fuck treason
Blast as you trespass, bullet enters your mouth and exits your ass
Impregnate the math, then give birth to a newborn
Figure of speech drew form, with 8 arms
Napalms, collapses stages you perform on dominate
Drama face, abominate, sling crack behind the black high gate
The nine fades the hearts of men
Slip the cartridge in
Off the hook like telemarketing sales condone over the phone


Danger zone
Bozzy Capone alone, in a terradome Stalon
With a great cannon, bones cerebral swollen
Straight both ways scanning
All you roaches lay down I spray the brain damage
Bring the banners, the green gamma ray
Gain up the same data, Scatter
Then a dark part where D and you used to play all day
The ray sound stung you, You kung fu check the cleaner
From fire line I gun you for fun
Dial 9-1-1
Someone tore down the tunnel son
1-2 Check your fronts
Captain Crunch, munch on you for lunch
You punchbag drunk, bald headed monk
Top bunk, chunk your trunk full of junk
Buffer and bump stop humping me
Ruff a scum sucking muthafuckas
Ducking my shit just luckily


Other emcees made a big mistake
Fronting on the mic that's truly great
What? how you want it fried or baked
I place in right through the heart of a snake
Sceam at mapps, take what we can take
Til the day we die, meet the pearly gates
Golden Arms going strong, I'm holding weight
Cause
(Repeat)




Stay ya'll, atonement, this one is for you, yes sir, a-yo


A-yo, I grab flows and throw 'em wit a twist of the wrist
I throw one inside your house like a Christmas gift
I'm the reason why these MC's be changing they flow
Cause every time I spit mine, they can't get no dough
Now y'all rappers pay attention, y'all don't know what it is
You just tearing the blocks down and shooting at kids
You not a thug to me now, and yeah, I know your type
You just wild to ya self, you not wild in the club
You wit your boys all the time, like a homo thug
You ain't never wit the honeys, you don't get no love
You make music for these assholes that be on the block
I make music for the world, just to bring up my stock
Come on y'all, y'all don't really know what it do
I drop jewels in your head like it's Purell shampoo
Martin Luther King & Malcolm X, Don' and Baby U
Spit the gospel in our rap, take brothers to church
Y'all taught 'em to sell crack, but we show 'em they worth
Wu-Tang music, this is how it suppose to sound
Y'all keep picking up the hood, while you putting us down
God is is love, come on, y'all


Come on, God is love, everybody say God is love
Come on, y'all say God is love
God is love, love, God is love, love


Gotta change my ways, my mother warned me
Calmly'll speak, time to air my dirty laundry
Angels that guard my body, lord, I'm sorry
Lord, I'm sorry for the things I did
It's strange out here, we bang out here
Killas, drug dealers, they hang out there
Cold stares, we don't care, we braid our hair
Lord, they hate out there, and there's jakes out where
Got plan to escape, they fake out here
Yea, they snakes out here, full of lies and deceit
Yea, they take out here, son died on his feet
Son cried in his sleep, can't forget his past
He lost a glass ring, just to flip some cash
He cried on the visit, his daughter kissed the glass
I need your blessings, but I missed the mass
I changed my ways, gotta shift the math
I picked my path, my wrongs is right
I used to hustle to the morning light
Then I found out, son, that there's more to life
They focused, indeed, my songs is tight
And survival of the fittest, with all my might
Got my legs and my brain, and all my sight
No more grief, and my teeth is white
And I never give up, and I keep the light

 (x2)
Come on, God is love, everybody say God is love
Come on, y'all say God is love
God is love, love, God is love, love


Hurses past us, demos, cast in stained glass windows
Pubes, pools of baptism, views of black victims
I snooze, catch visions of a beautiful world
No funerals, God musical, unusual pearls
Then, after it's judgement, then after the blood rips
Off of body and soul, we like Marcus Garvey in the godliest robes
And I awake from the sound of organs
The sound of families mourning, fallen grabbing his coffin
Will he fall or carried by the Lord wings
Absorbed in all the evil, that we do as the youth
So we, teach 'em the truth, you, teach 'em to shoot
Eve, ate out my fruit, then she, ate at my loot
Now we, pitch on the stoupe, til we rich in the coupe
Then someone snitch, you're found stiff in your boots
You need lessons, brothers, while I predicted the booth
Proverbs is truth, so who you listening to?

 (x2)
Come on, God is love, everybody say God is love
Come on, y'all say God is love
God is love, love, God is love, love




Yeah, know what I'm saying?
Wise Intelligent, broadcasting live from the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro
Know what I'm saying?
Hip hop go wherever I go
For real, Poor Righteous Teachers represent
'96 off the hook we're dropping this hit kid
Watch


Lord, how you be, madam G, peace God
Fuck frauds, get yours, kick ass, leave scars
On Mars I built a school to study life on Earth
Thoughts burst, a million rappers murdered in the first verse
Now what's worse than eating dirt, being buried alive
Put to death by surprise in the name of black gods
Ain't I most fly? Young pie don't cry
Dry the tears from your eye and your lover might live
Life to give, life to take, never making mistakes
All wise enjoying everything right and exact
Poor facts, pro-black, Donnelly Homes projects
Learn that time is the same on Casio or Rolex
Knowledge James, chapter two, verse one through six
But try not to judge a man by the price of his kicks
Come off this talk shit  convert words to actions
Cause you know Jersey runs things every time boy
Build destroy, Trenton must make noise
Enjoy the fruits of life, need the wife and my boys
My seed won't need for anything, trust me
Black man, 'nuff land, eight hundred acres of trees
Please the seven seas travel regularly
Degrees consciously study everywhere we be
Family daring he who talks enough shit
And come and get the stitch to fix the split upper lip
The shit providers
Will call us great civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers black


Whatever happened to the Gods and the Earths
They thirst for a pot of gold God's worth is birth
Knowledge is worth more than diamonds
When the mind is shining, surprise us
Gods Earths and 85ers


Dedicated to the Gods and the Earths
Dip dip dive-a, civilize an 85er


Intelligent, twenty-three, now nineteen five
Hold the mic I'll rise right in front of your eyes
In here six years see what I felt every year
Oh yeah it's ninety-six I'm born and understanding, understood
Get the goods, build a school down south
In some remote location that nobody knows about
Teach, add on to the life that we live
God degree, twelve jewels, eat the foot that I give
No pig, strictly kosher mathematics and fact
Poor blacks on track mission to take the Earth back
Cause Whitey got it locked, that's why the whole world's lost
We wearing crowns made of thorns and being put to the cross
Lost souls futures told in the Dead Sea Scrolls
God reduced to a savage lacking soul control
Talking lots of shit about his drugs and guns
Several daughters, 'nuff sons, ain't trying to raise none, yo
Whoa-ho-ho, let me slow up with the flow
Can't move too quick because niggas got to know
The duty of the civilized is to civilize the uncivilized
And make the world recognize
That God is Wise, and Wise is God to the death
And back to life, you Lazarus and I'm the Christ
The forthcoming, like a thief in the night
The wave of light, the key to everlasting life
That shit provide us, to call us straight civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers y'all


Whatever happened to the Gods and the Earths
They thirst for a pot of gold God worth his birth
Knowledge is worth more than diamonds
When the mind is shining, surprise us
Gods Earths and 85ers

 (x2)
Dedicated to the Gods and the Earths
Dip dip dive-a, civilize an 85er


Since I've been away I've been thinking about
How gunslingers turned singers and black culture went out
Wake up all you teachers tired of teaching and wait
Grass roots, pass truth into the ears of black youths
Watch me talk the talk and walk the walk right now
As mystic as it seems, I bring for real to your dream seeing
Midnight marauder got it dipped off the block drug
Street niggas bug cause they know we do it for the love
We rose above every limit that they said we had
Who loves your ass enough to strictly educate the mass?
Come get your cash, fill your mind with swine and dash
For longevity, these niggas we will never be
You will remember we from now till forever G
I am infinity, lyrics flowing endlessly
You ain't no friend to me so don't even pretend to be
Like O.J. Simpson be sleeping with the enemy
I call you out and make the world know your ass is lacking
Quoting some lessons but see no parts of understanding
You standing under my rain, snow, sleet, hail and thunder
That's why you wonder what's causing this to exist
I raise the mist, distill the myths of many currents
Don't be determined except to life forget the death
Nevertheless you're being blessed cause I'm who God is
Don't know the time niggas must be wearing Guess watches
Hands on your boxes, turn 'em up like seven notches
Your Magnavoxes amplify my super conscious
Shit providers, we'll call us straight civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers y'all


Hold it down kid and you don't stop
P.R.T. represent shop
(There's a new set of rules you shall all have to abide by
And the non-lyrical shall be terminated)




Yeah, this one right here
Is for those fly motherfuckers
All those motherfuckers get money
All those money makers
When you look in the mirror
And you confident, your cologne is on right
You smelling good, youknowhatimsayin'
You ready to go out on the town, knowhatimsayin'
It's all like this, go get pretty like me


I rock Dolce and Gabbana, Pierre Cardan frames
Please, sunset windblows, pictures in the breeze
Diamond cufflinks on, banging on my sleeve
The studded engraved, solid gold L.A.'s
Turn up my nose, to all those people that hate
Cuz I create the dinner plates, the things they can't
Mona Lisa's on my wall, I splash the Rem', brand
Then dance the tango, with a rose in my teeth
See this Spanish fly mami, with a rosary bead
Hold her close to me, then I scuff my Gucci loafers
Through money on the oochie, she fuck me in the Rover
I bent her over, the butter soft ostrich
After that, we had, some, sushi with some chopsticks
We blew the Grand Canyon, the mansion with the tropics
The house was made of marble, waterfall, walk-in closets
She had the red hots, had me coming out my boxers


There's no one in the city like me
No one gets gritty like me, homey
Big wheels spinnin' on D's
Go get pretty like me, Goldie
You're messin' with a real O.G
Ya'll niggas, y'all gon' see, homey
No one gets gritty like me, Goldie
Go get pretty like me


In the Rolls, vintage clothes like the mobster
Take my hat off, hit the mic stand like Sinatra
Seats at the opera, whose the man behind the suit
Fireplace, on the mantle, the head of a moose
Analyze the truth, still slicin' all you snakes
The lady killer, license plate, icing on the cake
Drop, anchors of weight, more paper, acres of states
Exquisite taste, cigars dipped, in that
You're strong back, Dom raps, time to bomb back
In fact, I'm giving hoes a back hand slap
Ain't that, one of the ten commandments of rap
My feet tap like Sammy, drop your donation
Black and white bitches, Puerto Ricans and Haitians
With Playboy titties, in heavy rotation
Getting that paper, is my motivation
In the palm of my hand, I control the nation, baby




Don't fuck with my bitches
Or you'll leave in stitches, homey
Silky silky silk, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, Goldie








I keep my third eye twenty-twenty, everything looking sunny
Gods told me, "nothing move but the money, Money"
Headstrong, backbone, hit them on a batphone
Could there be back home? Feeling like fresh chrome
Something for your headphone, build the establishment
Quit while you're ahead, save the embarassment
Elect me for president, thought I was irrelevant?
Battled all the elements, overcome their hardships
And struggled with accountants, shit got rocky
I trained in the mountains, now the world is mine
Got us spraying from the fountains, drive by the housing
Reminisce, take a piss, staircase, we made thousands!
We was Park Hill, rugrats, fishermen, thug hats
Five dollar snapbacks, never got no love back
That's why I sold packs, damn right I stole that!
Granule, hold that, now I want the whole stack
Changed my life, now it's rap, ain't no turning back


(Tell, tell) Golden Arms "maintain the fort"! x4


I'm on a mission, bred from the poorest conditions
Baby fed from the pots from the poorest of kitchens
Got bread in the streets, from the rawest addiction
Made a 180 turn, with the Lord's conviction
It's a riding prison
Keep the iron to my side, to avoid the friction
In this modern day slavery I survived the lynching
With no rap pension the price of living is too high
Two jobs working, this nigga is too tired
No more babies, she needs them tubes tied
Word on the tweets, "I heard he's a new guy"
"Heard he was too fly", damn maybe we should get scooped by a new ride
The ghetto's up in flames, think we should calm down
My insides is evil, you in the wrong town



Whatever you want, better watch yourself x2

U-God's Shout-Outs and Thanx's







1,2, 1,2, yo check this out, it's the jump off right now
I want everybody, to put your work down, put your guns down
And report to the pit, the gravel pit
Leave your problems at home, leave your children at home
We gon' take it back underground, I be Bobby Boulders
Wu-Tang Clan on yo' mind one time
It's the jump off, so just jump off my nigga


Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it


Ha, holocaust from the land of the lost
Behold the pale horse, off course (off course)
Follow me, Wu-Tang gotta be
The best thing since Starks and Clark Wallabees
African killer bees blackwatch
On your radio, blowin out yo' watts
From Park Hill, the house on haunted hill
Every time you walk by your back get a chill
Let's peel, who want to talk rap skills
I spit like a semi-automatic to the grill
Elbow grease, and elbow room
Baby play me, baby fall down, go boom
Party people gather round, count down to apocalypse
(I'm the kid with the golden arms)
And I'm the motherfuckin hott nikks pass the blunt
My nigga don't front
You had it for a minute but it seem like a month
Now I'm chokin, smokin, hopin
I don't croakin, from overdosin
Hey, kid, walk straight, master your high
Wu and Meth got you open (open), let's ride
Can't stand niggas that floss too much
Can't stand Bentleys they cost too much
Kid wanna get up then kid get touched
Kid wanna stick up then kid get stuck
I'm the one that called your bluff
When your boy tried to act tough
Remember what Ol' Dirty said: "I'll fuck yo' ass up!"
Now listen


Back, back and forth and forth


E with the English, extinguish styles extremist
Bald head beamers run wild
It's the kid with the gold cup
Stepped out like what
What's poppin, and y'all niggas dobo
Blastin shae shae, chocolate shortae
Rich color mocks, rock those all day
1960 shit I'm Goldie
That's right motherfucker don't hold me
The world's greatest, Las Vegas, paid as rock
Skin painted on my face look ageless
Perfect combos, Ghost bang out condos
Jeff from Hamo, ex three bangos
Bancos, stank hoes in plain clothes
Change those, bang those, same old, same old


Yeah y'all, straight up this the jump off right here
The gravel pit, word up represent, rock the boulders
All my rich gangsta style, killers, y'all know what time it is
Shorty do your thing, get up on that shit right now boo, do you
That's what I'm talkin 'bout


Yo, step to my groove, move like this
When we shoot the gift of course it's ruthless
Grab the mic with no excuses
In a sec, grab the Tecs and loot this
Executing, shaking all sets, and I'm breaking all hecks
I'm taking all bets, move all best, who want the dram' next
You all stank, we got the bigger bank
Bigger shank to fill your tank
Still the same kill you for real, while you crank
Slide, do or die, fry to bake
Admire the greats, on fire wit a heart of hate
Bitter shark, every part I take, heavy darts that quake
It's okay, all fakes, get caught by the dropkicks
You know the thrill, yes it's Park Hill
Yo we hit 'em with the hot grits
On the go, check the flow, saying Wu don't rock shit
Stop quick, hold the gossip, stop sweating my pockets
I hear the hot shit


Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it
You don't have to move a mountain
Just give me enough strength to climb
Oh Lord ! Don't take away my stumbling vows
And lead me a round


Yakub, maker and creator of the devil. Swine merchant... your time is near at hand. Fuck with me and your time will be now. Your presence here effects the mind of my people like a fever. You, Yakub, are the bearer of nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine diseases, evil, corrupt, porkchop-eatin' brain!




Shootouts, suicide car chases
Pulling loot out, bulletproof Scarfaces
Sharp fades, black Clark Gabe
Welcome to dark ages, hanging in dark places
With dark faces, escaped on bail
My souls in the street, police on the coat tails
Oh well, got a bitch named Gail
She look so good, her tail is for sale
Before L's fell, she scrambled the reefer
My foot so far in her ass, she can taste my sneaker
I pop champagne, like every day was Easter
Better, check that bitch, before I beast her
Tally the dough, slice the pizza
Despite the features, I hold a player's crown
I step in your town, snake skin down
Let off a round, check it how it sounds


Statepens ain't part of the plan
Need weed, guns & grams? (I can handle that, fam)
The pops life, but it's only for fam
A quick six figure scam (I can handle that, man)
It's real life, I got blood on my hands
And make the product expand (I can handle that, fam)
Yo, fuck scrams, try'nna front on my Clan
It'll only take a grand (just to handle that, man)


Yo, bottles pop, llamas and Glocks, kamikaze cops
Pop shots off of dollars and blocks, it's the
Regular regular, honor my spot
Whether flips, rubber gribs, top shotter stay hot
Swallowin' shots of Henn' rock, got the shit locked
Whether, gators and crocs, widebodies'll drop
Model bitch got vicked, never promised the rock
I'm a live one, that's why honey holla for pop
Hustle man, I ain't try'nna make a collar for cops
Like the, sun in your eye, with the knowledge I drop
Or like the, gun on your side, when the drama get hot
Chameleon through the streets, cuz they watchin' my ops
Full sign with the grind, get it started off top
Well known, still home, and your out of the box
Record day, with the thirty eight, dodgin' the NARC's
Hood to hood with the gangstas, I'm watchin' the plots




You ain't never been a hustler, why you try'nna act like one now
You front clown, you can get twisted like uptown's
Heard about your record, you're butt, clown
On the Island, deaded on your bogey, how you can't get a bus down?
Never heard of you, like a pump pound
Call me "Buckshot", believe me, everybody gon' "Duck Down"
Catch you while you postin' your pedestool, family so broke
When I clap, your mom can't even bet with you
Show you motherfuckas what heavy do, hold a lot of weight
And you running with "knicks" like Marbury do
I ain't try'nna cop the Chevy, shit, I'd rather
Leave this pussy nigga bleeding like I popped his cherry
When I come through the block, they leary
Shit, I got this nigga standing with dogs like the cops at the Ferry
Pray to God that my hammer don't jam, Wu-Tang be the Clan
Understand, I can handle it man, yeah






Yeah, we on a high stake game right now my G
No foots allowed, you understand?


I dribbled in Philly, doubled down in Vegas
Tripled off a nickel, down in Talladega
Tipped the oath, blood, money and smoke
And I swear the state wrote any rhymes that I quote
Here on now's about, stuffing the couch
Making sure that shit is slammed right in your mouth
I'm laying on cellophane bags stuffed in vials
Palms got itchy cause my girl blew trial
Checking for funny money purple life a marked bill
Throw your dick in the dirt for chopped grills
Open like a market of fleas and from
11-7, son if you copping for trees
And I'm only fucking with 20s and Z's
If you get the wrong idea, you better come with the D's
Cause the bank won't stop and the bank won't freeze
A double dose of process and 4 g's


I spent a lot of time on the bounce to get it right
Stay rough around the edges like a bare-knuckle fight
Call me Smokey Robinson when I write as I'm a journal
I keep the burner tucked, deep inside the thermal
And the way I hear you talking to me is irrelevant
My laser sharp speech, makes me relevant
Makes the ground shake like a gang of elephants
And I came with mathematics, supreme intelligence
So I can mix it in the pot and watch the rocks just melt
Or put holes on the block it's just a notch on my belt
Or invest in new bubbles watch it rock it and sell
When the pockets start to swell, I'm taking that lane
Hit the button doors open like butterfly wings
And the sound system jumping on the summertime thing
And we always up to something when the temperature's hot
At the Maldives island watch the landing gear drop


Lyrical battles I identify with
I load up and exploit this fly gift
The clip is filled with 16 bars
Lead hits the paper so the loose leaf scarred
The mic booth is bulletproof
Anger and frustration, auto fire from hooded youths
In the darkest area assassin down to bury ya
Decode a message from the fastest carrier
This craft of trade with a sharp blade
A double-edged sword give life in dark fades
Turn murderous rap only means I killed it
Up close and personal, Wu-Tang we filled it
Mic masters Hip Hop's hallmark
The Big Bang of rap and the center was all dark
Then came the spark and we begin to rhyme
And shine light on the world in the form of art




I got a heart of stone, flesh and bone
Red skin tone, rap syndrome


I'm that street sweeper, dope beat finder
Forty four piece, keep on pushing with a meat grinder
Heat mizer, to all you competitors
You regular, regular, I'm ten steps ahead of ya
Return of the predator, let me demonstrate
Make niggas spill blood like women menunstrate
And I'm, fresh out the gate, guess who trunkin' through
If he fight to the death, I'mma buckle you
Yea, I'm all stressed out, I'm not confortable
I don't play by your rules, I stick and move
Everyday that you do, catches up to you
I want my cake and eat it too, stop the game
Leave bruises on your neck, when I pop your chain
Yeah, the hunger/pain, make me an awesome thug
I'm my own verdict, fuck the jury, the judge
Yeah, hear me loud, I bring fury to clubs




I rap gritty, cuz the city's infested
I got the city trapped, trapped in my deathgrip
When the tech spit, we bang out excedrin
Yeah, you wet kid, the aftershock's around ya
Can't wait to let off, the eighteen pounder
The bulldog growler, potato on the end
I don't turn belly up, or jelly on a friend
They held me in the pens, twenty three hour options
Locked in, now I'm in the top ten
I'll never bend, heads give up
When I, see ready for, dead in the dust
I throw up the crust, then I shatter they mask
It's a must, it's a must, that I shoot fast, come on!




The streets is like Satan, I'm from the Hill
Cuz people keep hating, cuz I score at will
Don't fuck with new niggas, I figured they wired
I set 'em on fire, like the name was Pryor
I'm a livewire brother, that's something superb
Want a glass room mansion, up in New Jers'
Puff a dutch and an herb, stay in touch with ya bird
In an all black Phantom, crushing the curbs
Spill my guts on my word, cuz my measure is lethal
From the Oooh Building, my Resident Evil
Throw consecutive free throws, I'm poppin' the Don
Better, clear the way, another blow from the Arm
And don't be alarmed, when I'm scrappin' this CREAM
With knicks the size of ice cubes, taking your fiends
And I popped out the rifle and M-16
You see me on the screen with the Charlie's Angels
All in the closet, keep nothing but Kangols
Catch him in Bahamas eating all the mango's
Call in for drama, bring on the pay load






Hang glide for my nigga Tical
Yo, word to God we run this whole shit Son (no doubt)
Right that's my word, guaranteed you're dealing with the invincible (no doubt)
(I'm specialized in swordsmanship)
That's my word, Persian Legacy one time, one time
That's the science of the black man
Stationary niggas, have fun on this right here
Yo Shorty cross your arms
Gonna rock niggas to sleep this year (throw your leather up)


Blade thrower, sword swinga, killa bee ringer
Rocky road roll dark greener
Cream fademas, name your God-U Kareema
Shout out Medina, federaloes Noxzema
Me, jewelery cleaner Million Man March screamers
Ray Catena, cut your joint Wolverine
The Longines, wrapped around the wrist, law seen her
How I got that yo, threw out the macker named Gina
Bust a shot, seen her, it richocheted, tapped Tina
Now I'm out, lampin in Korea with Talima
We moseyin, sweatsuit Adidas, best believe
I got the black heater little joint, probably Moschino
Yo Bobby Robby whattup, Max tried to follow me
Sadaam loungin, clean up collect, like the laundry
It's time yo swerve like the Nike line
Windbreaker Laker throw a jump shot scrape her
Statuary yo floatin that snatch-uary
Aiyyo, blow a hole in your limo, weed pass the dutch


Yo this is MC wizardry, killa bee invasion
Men of respect, blessed with wisdom of the ancients
My words are blatant, lacerate necks for statements
I launch like lead projectiles, straight out the basement
I suplex your rep, left ruined like the Aztecs
Parasites, double edge dice your larynx
My hip-hop, is quarantined locked inside the detox
Under key lock, it's like b-block and E-Glocks
You're ill, your trail ends, thoughts are frail
I strike the cypher, and let one survive to tell the tale
Of my state of grace, I raise the stakes on snakes
Knock em off like the big eights for takin up space
Never did fear em, stick em with the truth serum
Who sent em, arrest em before my charge is ended
Designated hitter flows split the transistor
Kinetic globes light when it shine, burns your retina
Urban journal, plus eternal broadcaster
Before and after, I be Self Lord And Master


I be the Ironside, get touched, with the chloride
Take walk with the Nine-Finger bandits worldwide
Shaolin hillside, full of homicides
FUCK you dissatisfied the double dyed black brown iodine


Yo, box talk sequence, powerhouse kickout
Eyes dusty, wet, butt-naked with my dick out
I'm direct, golden best, golden chest is blessed
Scarce chapter, snatch a batch of Winterfresh
It sound farfetched, mountain men that be rich
You get buckshot, dummy-clapped, mummy-wrapped and stitched
The Jeffrey Dahmer Notre Dame-r sing the song the strongest
Brute force bullethole straight through your chorus
Shank you with the think tank, harmony cake cut
A can of ass-whoopin', Flurry shake break, you fucks
Struck, love crooks, why for lyin hooks
Chef cocaine cook, a marvelous book
This deathbed doctrine, paper for the youth
What remains, a saber-toothed tiger in the booth


Last night, I took a trip down to Crown Heights
Fast life, females are trife, stay tight
I detect that parasite, satellite
RZA beat makes me wanna fight get hyped, come to do shows
My slang sound write secretary type
Backflip on the mic, I'm the poor black man
Workin hard for the grand, I understand clear
Don't fear, peep my new gear it's different from yours
My style drop like drawers, you see me on tours
Don't you wait to say peace, the kid from the street
Put my technology on the track, just then the core attack
Wu article, Cappa, five, CD attack
But my talk stage live killa beehive
Bermuda my life angle, rectangle gold fronts
Bring the gold bangle, never make me throw darts
Check out my arts, when I release my smarts
Hot like Pop Tarts, aim me at the charts




Man I'm a giant, call em entertainer
Biggest in the game, money generator
Rugged style innovator, smash all boundaries
I'm in your head, base line keep pounding me
Keep astounding me, capture the moment
I'm your most dangerous opponent
The good shit, yeah, yeah, I'm on it
Stinging up your city like the shaolin hornets
I just been promoted, got my stars and stripes
My heavy duty badges are my scars of life
My anger hit the pen, you know my bars get tight
Fly cars, I want my name In stars and lights
This heavyweight life with the dose of thrills
We pulling in the houses in the Hollywood hills
The God got skills, educated listener
Rap call the W, the MC conditioner
Rap fans listen up, we switchin up and resignate
One man army, your hands in your mental state
Enemies disintegrate, worldwide I captivate
Ieft for a minute, came back like a heavyweight


Got plenty big things under my belt 
Cuz you fucking with a heavyweight
Fuck fucking with a heavyweight, heavyweight
Fuck fucking with a heavyweight
Fucking with a heavyweight


I grew up hard, my cards is dealt
Got plenty big things under my belt
Went from the block where the grams would melt
Stopped thru many land, my clan was felt
The grams is hell, and life is good
Went from a strip to a righteous dude
Went from a strip to ringside seats
Egyptians cotton, kings size sheets
Kissed Janet on the cheeks, party with Puff
Roll the tour bus to the finest cities
Rock the whole Europe, touch the finest titties
Collections of fifties, gritties and weed jars
Movie stars and the finer days
Left Eye, Aaliyah and Isaac Hayes
Back in the days, nothing to play with
Wu-Tang Clan, we stayed on your playlist
Shouts to the DJs that made us famous
Written in the books with the hall of famers
Written in stone, next to all the singers
Thanks to the fans, the love you gave us






Gangster this and gangster that
Half of ya'll ain't gangstas, so hold that *gun shot* Blaow!


I got a deathwish, my playlist is wreckless
Almost famous but the natives gettin' restless
Leave 'em breathless, guess who popped up
With pile out, hear you talkin' like Wu's washed up
Squash what, I got balls and guts, more deluxe
The magnetic flux, in the all black tux'
And my back's all hushed, lead showers for you mutts
I devour the cuts with a power packed punch
And cowards I hunt, when I ride with my gun
I'm like a spoke on the wheel that glides on the drum
Through the, smoke I reveal, I'm the rising sun
That go through your shield, is he really that Hill?
Let the streets decide, with nerves of steel
Let the beats collide, with the death-defyin' skill
And beneath the sky, lurkin' network of strangers
That insert the danger with a touch of a finger


Oh no... watch... out... here... they... come
(Gangster this and gangster that
Half of ya'll ain't gangstas, so hold that *gun shot* Blaow!
Stand up... with... my... real... nig... gas
(Gangster this and gangster that
Half of ya'll ain't gangstas, so hold that *gun shot* Blaow!)


Yo, aiyo, I'm speakin' for myself, my feets on stealth
Fuck thirty deep, I'm in your hood for delf
Blowin' trees with your main squeeze countin' my shells
As I feed the clips to the T, handle it well
Never been the one to front, son, my history's swell
Tell you how it's gon' be, what it was and what it is
Catch you in your sleep, thug, now your memory lives
The streets get the buzz, no love, them same thugs snitch, bitch
Learned you was livewire, mafia lie
You get wired, by real gangstas and big buyers
Messin' with fire, you ought to leave town
Son, there's rules to this game, and these lames wanna be down
Bringin' all clothes, most fold when it go down
4-5 pounds out the gate, nigga, slow down
I recognize real, and it ain't how you sound
It's the shit that you feel when I'm bustin' the pound




Niggas keep talkin', better keep walkin'
Walk the block frontin', you ain't sayin' nothin'
You ain't poppin' nothin', you ain't cuttin' nottin'
Son, stop stuntin', before I start dumpin'


I apply your bones to the grindstone, to roam on the block with the chrome
Son I smack you out your rhinestones, holmes
I zone where the average man is not permitted to stand
Unless you got that thang, in your hands
Screamin' fans wanna touch me, groupies wanna fuck me
And crabs that don't wanna see me make it, try to bust me
Trust me, I got my shit on cock
So now I'm ready to rock you on the spot and put you in a human Ziploc
With the clip in his lock, and my hand over my heart
I swear to be my brother's keeper, til death do us part
The truest darts spoken in broken language, got you soakin' wet
Like a bottle of Dutch juice, with the mint leaves
Nigga please, the trigger squeeze in every direction
Blood is similar to viral effects, enter your section
And my posession is a deadly weapon
This pen that I use, to bang a hole in your neck, nigga, you suspect






Yo, Yo, the average man couldn't last that long
She like to work out, run marathons
She wear tight skirts with no panties on
She's a six foot one bronze Amazon
Say it, complaining all the good men is gone
I'm from Babylon, she reads the Qur'an
Visits all the jails and the nail salons
Rock Coco Chanel, her smell was strong
With skin like velvet she rocked my bed
Buffed my helmet, sipping Long Island Red
She spread eagle at the tip of the bed
I rubbed on her legs this is what I said


That's how I like my chicks, heavy on the hips
Jump up, bounce with me, what's up honey dip
That's how I like my chicks, heavy on the hips
Jump up, bounce with me, come up over here


She's a thing of beauty, she's so mean
Heavy in them jeans, every man's dream
As real as it may seem I approach you with calm speech
I'm form New York, honey from Long Beach
She's intelligent, the President's arm piece
But that's irrelevant, I'm in like Flint
She nicknamed her breastesses the Wonder Twins
She went to the exorcist it's under skin
She loved grown men, she loved the thrills
She jumped out the Benz with the buns of steel
She's the trend setter on the cover of Maxim
Secluded in the cabin in the hills of Aspen
Life's always boring, she needed some action
She had passion with Louis Vuitton hand bags
She didn't like the chronic but she loved my swag
She loved giving head when she's on the rag


That's how I like my chicks, heavy on the hips
Jump up, bounce with me, what's up honey dip
That's how I like my chicks, heavy on the hips
Jump up, bounce with me, come up over here


She did her dip, almost broke my hip
That girl, she was, getting down
Told her to go home, told her to leave me alone
Look at that girl, she kept, getting down, down, down


That's how I like my chicks, heavy on the hips
Jump up, bounce with me, what's up honey dip
That's how I like my chicks, heavy on the hips
Jump up, bounce with me, come up over here




What's the outcome when you're testing mines?
Snatch spies when the weapon reclines
The headlines read the man of steel made him bleed
Shooting a trigger, super nigga called Christopher Reeves
No tricks up my sleeve, what lies in my fist, won't permit you breathe
Hit you with three, now when you piss you bleed
A risk indeed, my format can kill, on a warpath
Thoughts crashed, fasten your grill
Mastered the skill of tongue lashing
Still I unfasten my jaw then spill out the raw
Peel out the four, with the fifth attached
The impact, was forced, you caught the kick back
Clap the scar, where the bullet was lodged in the boulevard
It's hard crash, blow your car
Oddjob, some rob, some resort to God
Some snort the import, they got lost in the fog
For Porche cars, Lamborghinis, bikini's, pinky rings blingy
Blowin' the stinky, drink with me
Bang to the fullest respect, stay in check
Or lay down, when I'm pullin' the tech
I eject on your set, to disconnect it
Life support system, direct, you wreckless
The Texas Chainsaw, sever you brains off
To hang the corpse, when I aim the torch


We hit 'em up, hit 'em up, hit 'em up, hit 'em up
(Then ride out, ride out, ride out, ride out)


The sharp and expensive, blinding ya senses
Lean back in the stretch Lex'
Crack the treasure chest, it's one of the best
Now, feel the force of the full court press
I apply the kiss of death, something for real
The realness, untouchable Eliot Ness
Yo select a vet, take me off the bench, I'm supposed to lynch
The angel in the air, you can smell the stench
Soldiers in the trench, moving east to west
I gave you a note, you can keep the rest
Rip the whole coast, when I heat the flesh
At the Greek Fest, hit a couple of bars
Smash whips and strips like bumper cars
Your amongst the odds and what lies in the pelly'
The baby Glock nine, the size of a celly
Now it's a "Dilemma" like Nelly and Kelly
Milk Pirelli tire, when I put that in a hurry
With a fist of fury, martini with a cherry
Very necessary when I make it to the top
Imma cop Halle Berry
Staten Island Ferry where the legends were made
In the staircase, throw a rap grenade
Take it back in the day, get clapped for ya chain
Left your bloodbath on behalf of the pain
He's a high grain bullet, women call him daddy
Fish tank shoes, jumped out the Caddy
Grand finale, yo, the champ is here
The cameras glare under the chandelier
Why you standing there, like you can hold it down
There's nine of us, only one can wear the crown
Tear it down, down to the last compound
New York mix with a Compton style
Go bonkers wild on ya stomping ground
Lay down the carpet when I walk down the aisle
Telephone cutie keep stalking the child
For a misdemeanor, now I'm going to trial
Secluded in exile, like my sex wild
Private jet style, who the livest vet now?
Pass me a wet towel, don't get vexed, now
Bring it your chest when I let the tech growl






Windshield, rappers are like gnats
They're gettin' splattered 'pon the windshield
Fallin' down like London Bridge, my blade split your onion head
Axe that like Paul Bunyan, Meth prefers the gun instead
Bong bong, put a hole inside your head


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw


How come the streets don't want me to live?
Plus my niggas keep tellin' me fibs
But the devil done poisoned my wiz
I'm doin' this for my family and kids
I'm tryna be wealthy, take my time right and stay healthy
Said it before but I don't think nobody felt me
Yo tried to understand this hand that this life dealt me
I'm on the verge of a whole new makeover
My fake friends, they can take it like a takeover
I'm ready to eat, I'm ready to grip it
Got enemies everywhere, I got chicks that's wicked
Sick shit, niggas doin' wicked ass wig shit
Bid shit, tellin' jakes that I had the biscuit
Niggas be wantin' my leftovers
I'm like a general that died and lost some of his best soldiers
I burn holsters and I kill that dirt religion
Murk that pigeon and I shoot the television


Got that trey pound on you, run down on you
Hard boiled nigga, Clan top soil
My fam straight royal, I'mma die loyal
When them shooters come for you, better throw your flag 'em
I'm pure gun oil, let 'em see that hand cannon
Foundation strong, never ride a bandwagon
Andrew Jacksons, hand-to-hand transaction
Cops jumped out, caught him with his pants saggin'
Criminal individuals up in here
Wild like the theme park ride called The Buccaneer
Weed in the Tupperware, throw you off the upper tiers
Suweeee, I got all my niggas up in here


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw


Imagine the sound of your face scrapin' up against the gate
Of a barbed wire fence, this is barbed iron fist
Heartthrob, iron dick, hoes slob the nob quick
This is odd, so throw it in your iPod quick


Lifeless activity, constant movement
Buyin' elasticity, such improvement
Sword held to where it collapses inward
Spillin' rhymes if it's Shaolin vineyards
RZA had a mixture, then he added sound to the picture
Co-author rewrote the scripture
Math worked from birth, doubled the net worth
Amplified in the time machine of early Earth
A two-way radio, simple yet complex
Receivers, transmitters, interest to contacts
The emergence of the earliest atoms
Transform to a level extremely hard to fathom
Same soup, different bowl, Wu ceramics
Same group on them large-scale dynamics
A wave triggered the burst, glass was shattered
Galactic matter served on a graphic platter


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw


Overachiever, power hungry overeater
I95, whip fly like an overseer
I'm overconfident but some might say I'm overeager
Or overzealous, especially when it's over cheeba
I got a soldier's features, I rock the coldest sneakers
My sneakers' so cold, can't wear 'em 'less you hold the heater
Can't push me over either, that go for dojas
I ain't got no love for posers neither, keep my composure
I'm focused, tryna roll the reefer, let's turn it up
Forget the cope, I'm tryna blow the speaker, that's all he wrote
One verse could turn your soul to ether
It's time you gave me my respects just like the old Aretha
Mr. Meeeth


We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw

(feat. U-God)

Yeah ninety six Park Hill style
Burial ground sound in it forever Dunn
Politic

Verse One: Cappadonna/Cappachino
Here we come right through your eardrum Dunn
Cherry head catch feel the draft of the aks
You catch one trying to pretend you could win
Headlock show the block kid counterattack
Don of mine stay connect 4th Disciple trife
Ain't nuthin ice cream, kid you get blown like steam
Park Hill Projects, the black Idi Amin
Ninety-six era, not the crossover lever
Chain swinger talk swing, probably wardrobe king
So what now? Industry kids'll lock it down
Only two loyal, dustin that find you there for
You wanted to enter thirty-six in the soil
My technique is speak have you knocked out weak
Forever in it, my slang dick goes so deep
Thirsty for hip-hop, Staten Isle niggas can't stop
Runnin wild like a child till we reach the top
Stapleton, New Bright, and West Brighton the harbor
Connect, me for vet, Don King and a tech
Thug cats'll get done up on black man's sun up
Cap the imperial, bring out new material
You hold me down, analyze all cherry-head
Wu is in town, catch the hand-off
Prepare for my dancehall standoff
Mercy when I come blow your mic-hand off, sorry I touched him
Here they come again through customs
Mad ways to dead the wax one way to bust him

Chorus:
If it's alright with you it's alright with me
We can take this rap game to a higher degree
We can do this Spike Lee or how you want it to be
Check it, Golden Arms plus new Cappadon

Verse Two: U-God, AKA Golden Arms
These ninety-nine powerful circling swords
Impact from all the heat dug deep and locked on
Chip off the bone, hard face and hard fists
Chop off your option, have you felt a neck twist
Cassette disc and wrist, meltdown your pistol mist
Burnt to a crisp, bombarded my pistol grip
Tongue gripped the nigga, raw tone the jawbone
Leaning Tower Pisa sounds of the Mars zone
Chef dropped that bomb, the takeout will still linger
Twenty crazy christians, to lock in hole and heat up
Who the finger rap singer with hip layers of phlegm
Caused by blunt smoke, heart disease plays the friend
I ran out emotion, my rap style's devotion
I got hosts for you Soviet peoples across the ocean
My path releases, volcanic acids
Engage in the page activity is autographics
Fraction of my busting microphones start to lust and
Words plays over power practice might bust em
The black male persuasion known to hunt you for sane
The Big Apple verbal concert, for the occasion
The vital snap, now insert my Spinal Tap
I got forty more swipes to pipe, thirty slapped
The power from the cram broke the bottom of the pan
With Earth Wind and Fire, ice water dead grams
American hustler up and coming with a vengeance
Makes no magnet charge, plug vivid my extension
One lesson motivation for my pistol profestation
Slang person nailed now we move on a motation
Location, point-blank, on point be the vessel
Politic the defecit measure, point the decibel
We're credible, renaissance, eatin off the barrel
Advanced chemo, Die Hard to my demo
Chorus



 Yo, check check it
 You can never defeat
 Yo, check the method of this shit right here one time
 The Gods
 Sparking your braincells to the upmost
 Impossible
 Unlimited epidemics being spreaded
 You can never defeat
 You know, we try and add on for y'all niggas
 The Gods
 Yo, yo


Fusion of the five elements, to search for the higher intelligence
Women walk around celibate, living irrelevant
The most benevolent king, communication through your dreams
Mental pictures been painted, Allah's heard and seen
Everywhere, throughout your surrounding atmosphere
Troposphere, thermosphere, stratosphere
Can you imagine from one single idea, everything appeared here
Understanding makes my truth, crystal clear
Innocent black immigrants locked in housing tenements
Eighty-Five percent tenants depended welfare recipients
Stapleton's been stamped as a concentration camp
At night I walk through, third eye as bright as a street lamp
Electric microbes, robotic probes
Taking telescope pictures of globe, babies getting pierced with microchips
Stuffed inside their earlobes, then examinated
Blood contaminated, vaccinated, lives fabricated
Exaggerated authorization, Food and Drug Administration
Testing poison in prison population
My occupation to stop the inauguration of Satan
Some claim that it was Reagan, so I come to slay men
Like Bartholomew, cause every particle is physical article
Was diabolical to the last visible molecule
A spaceknight like Rom, consume planets like Unicron
Blasting photon bombs from the arm like Galvatron


United Nations, gun bias style patient
Formulating rap plural acapella occupation
Conquer land like Napoleon, military bomb fest
We want sanitary food, planetary conquest
Thug peoples on some hardco' body shit
Get your shit together 'fore the fuck Illuminati hit
Dreams is free and escape is sleep
For a fool peep jewels, keep tools for tough time
The rule of rough mind, elevate, stay behind
The sun gotta shine, keep on, cremate
The whole Babylon, times up, move on
Kings on your pawn, checkmate, no fakes
Supposed through the gate, case closed
Things get froze, when it comes time, chosen ones
Will holding guns, we take flight with no fright
And attack, never fear cause our words is clear
What's been done can't be undone Son, we can't care
Cause the last days and times are surely here
Snakes and flakes get blown, by the righteous ones
Divine minds bind, we unified as one
Half of black folk, we half broke, smoke a bowl of weed shit
Our everlasting essence stay flying over Egypt


For you to defeat, the Gods
Impossible, you can never... defeat
The

Gods
Impossible
For you to defeat, the Gods


Call an ambulance, Jamie been shot, word to Kimmy
Don't go son, nigga you my motherfucking heart
Stay still son, don't move, just think about Keeba
She'll be three in January, your young God needs ya
The ambulance is taking too long
Everybody get the fuck back, excuse me bitch, gimme your jack
One, seven one eight, nine one one, low battery, damn
Blood comin out his mouth, he bleedin badly
Nahhh Jamie, don't start that shit
Keep your head up, if you escape hell we gettin fucked up
When we was eight, we went to Bat Day to see the Yanks
In Sixty-Nine, his father and mines, they robbed banks
He pointed to the charm on his neck
With his last bit of energy left, told me rock it with respect
I opened it, seen the God holdin his kids
Photogenic, tears just burst out my wig
Plus he dropped one, oh shit, here come his Old Earth
With no shoes on, screamin holdin her breasts with a gown on
She fell and then lightly touched his jaw, kissed him
Rubbed his hair, turned around the ambulance was there
Plus the blue coats, Officer Lough, took it as a joke
Weeks ago he strip-searched the God and gave him back his coke
Bitches yellin, Beenie Man swung on Helen
In the back of a cop car, Dirty Tasha are tellin
But suddenly a chill came through it was weird
Felt like my man, was cast out my heaven now we share
Laid on the stretcher, blood on his Wally's like ketchup
Deep like the full assassination with a sketch of it
It can't be, from Yoo-hoo to Lee's
Second grade humped the teachers, about to leave
Finally this closed chapter, comes to an end
He was announced, pronounced dead, y'all, at twelve ten


Now what my man is trying to tell y'all
Is that across the whole globe
The murder rates is increasin, and we decreasing
So at the same time, when you play with guns
When you play with guns Son
That causes the conflict of you going against your own
You hear me, so let's pay attention
Straight up and down, cause this is only a story
From the real




I'm that warlord that's out for the gold
Let your scandal leak out, now your cover gets blowned
Shit ain't sweet, son, my mind stays grown
The thirst alone, makes me, burst my chrome
It hurts when I see you, you're my first clone
But, daddy's home on some violator shit
We annihilator, out the alligator pits
Show 'em your strength, breathe easy on them hits
Niggas get rich, with homes on they head
Throw me in the streets, that's where our grown men bred
On the corner with the dred, dusty Leon
Fatman in jail, five hundred pound penitentiary still
From the Hills, slapped on the scale
High honor, Shaolin bomber
With the rockstar persona, connect with the largest
You play me, you payin' fifty cent chargers
Put this log in your noggin, he's on a rampage
Cuz he keeps charging, fuck all the arguing
Like bitches, ain't no I in team
That's why we can't get the riches, play your position, nigga


Yeah, I'm talkin' to you...
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you...


On my solo destiny, try to shit on me
When I break you chains, all you lames gonna plead
Greed and lie just to get what you need
Feed off my rhymes and my recipe
Can you see that my eyes, I need an extra squeeze
Or a Beck's to relieve all the stress you need
Stop testing me, then set me free
The street fatigue, two keys and a jeep
Buckshot, nine niggas tried to replace me
I'm a prime time figure to the next degree
Now it's bye-bye, nigga, too weak to play deep
Afraid in your sleep, up the charts I creep
Monologues I speak, stay blowin' out the nostril
Inside you're weak, portrayin' that you're hostile
Swallow your pride, keep my name out your tonsils
I bury you, til they, find your fossil
The rap O.J., in the dusty Bronco
Bang on my chest like the King of Kongo
You and your brother is a dirty combo
You bird ass niggas, catch thirty, pronto




Big ballers never quit, what can you tell me
But a belly full of lies, stranded on a battlefield
Too many times, with nickel and dime rhyme
One of your best killers, you know that I feel this
Pushin' near my weakness, just Air Max sneakers
Keep feedin' lyrics on big ol' speakers
Peep that performer on the humble, I'm comin' for you
Watch these young boys rumble, what you gonna do?






The modern day, multi-rap, Penny Hardaway
Allah's way, God's day, Range in the garage way
Freak this, slap meat on this uniqueness
Relax overseas status black beat your feet to this
The grim style Role' sundial, Sun of a Man who went
Foul spent, ten thou' on jewels, 80 cent on Loud
Slang lord, applaud, forty-eight up on the board
Holding the stainless plain sword with ya name on it
Lord, burn 'em, ninety-eight degrees Celsius
Go for delf, no breaks, from stealth, crash it on the belt
Almost lost the eagle, the diamond gem I paid 30 legal
Crash the bird, cranberry regal
Stepped off, double oh-eight style
Bubble the tape out, real niggas who kill bless the weight style
The treasure map stash billions, smash a class of Sicilians
Glassy watch flooded out for trillions
A million dollar lawsuit, got paid and swayed you
And floored you flowerhead niggas lost you
What? Faggots, come up over here
We got it all and I'm the holy child of war


I know niggas who carry guns like
The same way the Earth keep in sunlight
With no fight, snatch your ice, sell it in Crown Heights
We grab mics, Malcolm X type, Israelites
From the poor like, holy war type
We got your lost wife
Loving me, fuck the bubbly, it's the drugs in me
Cover me, I want his company, and all the currency
They out to live luxury, cheat and lie, die comfortably
Nautica Rugby's like Seagal Bugsy
Y'all disgust me, Nia Long sisters want me
A King David strong country, we still be hungry
Too many rap braggarts back stabbers, abracadabras
Get hit by the golden daggers (bring it!!)


Intellectual, rhyming professionals
Bring all the ladies, in my directional
Intellectual, rhyming professionals
Bring all the ladies, in our directional
Intellectual, rhyming professionals
Intellectual, rhyming professionals
Intellectual, rhyming professionals
Bring all the ladies, in our directional


Inevitable, fed of all rhymes, like vegetables, yo
And when I let go, the deny the oaths, amigos
Lessons be stressing the fact without question
Determining who gives who, a slap to a westman
Bugging while smuggling, lyrics cold bum-rushing
Touching your brain leaving it, left, while recovering
Tagged, by the fact they rap the daily contract
And ac-cessory the best of me flipping void and fast crack


My attitude is metal, I'm rotten to the veins
Saber-toothed tiger in the booth still remains
You see let it be let your soul feel free
And disdained with the horror from the powers that be
And it's grabbing me, jabbing me
Stabbing me, imagine me trapped
Fully packed anti, combat, gravity rap that
The A-Alike attracts and, Hunchback chills
The sinner's to gain reveal, Homicide Hill
The thunder style underground, Plymouth Rock
The loud mouth grouch in your house, Comstock
The curser, verse with the worser thirster frantic
The felony's swelling me, telling me to push the panic


Living in the world today
Making room for our seeds to see a brighter day
Who's to say real thug niggas don't pray
That's why we drop jewels, we drop jewels
C'mon, living in the world today
Making room for our seeds to see a brighter day
Who's to say real thug niggas don't pray
That's why we drop jewels, we drop jewels


Cause we drop jewels
We catch it, if you don't I sit
Nothing but jewels
Living in the world today
Living in the world today
We drop jewels, we drop jewels
Locked up for 13 years
The album
Sunz of Man is out, what?
Bring it bring it
South coming, intellectual, rhyming professional
Ladies and children
Everybody facing our directional
We coming like a storm
Be in the night, everybody ask when the album gon' drop
Here it is? want this?
Sunz of Man, Prodigal Sunn, Hell Razah
60 Second Assassin, Killah Priest, Raekwon, U-God
This is how we do it
You don't want it




Here we go, come on


"A battle-A battle was fought, in Brooklyn..."
"Hessian Soldiers killed 3,000 men; much of the fighting took place in what is now Prospect Park in Green-Wood Cemetery as well as the Park Slope and Gowanus neighborhoods."
"This was the first battle of America."


Rugged rhymsters, crooked crimesters
Dime droppers, Twenty-five-to-lifers
Backstabbers, low blowers
Illegal... cocaine growers
Starvation, profanity
Anxiety, brothers trying me
Gun slingers, dead ringers


Yo, my slang's out of this world
Mix collaboration man, little man and his girl
Way of life got me thinking, plus I'm analyzing young
Youths on roofs, you know, three time felony brutes
Roll together, tropical trees puff, whatever
Yo we could go run up on, kids for leathers
What drug? Faculties bubble keys for G's
Cream flow like seven seas, hit chicks Guyanese
Word up, hold your head before you fall out
The morgue route, the devil want that
Let's get my niggas locked all out
Change for better, that be my only vendetta
With life, feed your seed right, he's breathing indeed right
Chef, remarkable, sparkable, raps and tackable gats
Never get jacked, see ya then move black
Paradise trife, plush with much ice
Getting nice, laying back, sleep all my life; word up!


"The battle of Brooklyn depicted was the bloodiest
Clash of the American revolution. Soldiers killed
3,000 men, much of the fighting took place in what is now..."


Crack patients, dime smokers
Vial carriers, mocha tokers
Burnt buildings, brothers building
Save the children, investigative reports!


Calling all cars, calling all cars! Ghetto
Psychos, armed and dangerous, leaving mad scars
On those who are found bound, gagged and shot
When they blast the spot, victims took off like astronauts
Get with this, even your best can't
Come on down, you're the next contestant!
Get your pockets dug from all your Chemical Bank ends
Caught him at the red light  on Putnam Avenue and Franklin
They used to heat up the cipher with a shot that was hyper
Than your average JFK sniper
He just came home from Spofford
Rolling like Kaufman, and laid that ass out like carpet
Stop the stuttering boy, save complaints for the five-oh
Then praise the God  chk-a-chk POW!
They release shots and premeditate to grab
And then they jet back to the lab
And then remain in Shaolin, an endangered island
Where shorties lose blood by the gallons


"Have integrated a number of corrupt cops, judges
...into high-level positions, to insure the continued
Success of the drug smuggling and money laundering operations"


Crack patients, dime smokers
Vial carriers, mocha tokers
Burnt buildings, brothers building
Save the children, investigative reports!


Yo, I grab the pen for revenge and let loose, see
Like Muslims, standing on the block, rocking a kufi
The hundred-dollar kick rocking kid's back for more
Starting gun wars, with black Reeboks and Velours
Jungle way of life, living villain
Packed with visions, copywritten
Throwing bread to pigeons, Christ has risen
King Elegant, slang master, jack expensive noodle hats
In sixty-nine, old timers time that brothers shot craps
The baggy blue Guess jeans, pull strings off in Palm Springs
I'm locked in the bing, Rocky ring labelled rap king
The corner emperor  the golden thieves play the benches
Rednecks be hanging big niggas down in Memphis
Back in Now-Y, hit the bull's eye with loaded nines
Life is like Tarzan, swinging from a thin vine
Shatter dreams, then mirrors don't need a press spirals
Aim at the white shadows with big barrels
Of Moet-ers, the bald headers, milk and Armarettas
Who fear none, crushing all personal vendettas, yo
They use guns while we angrily shot arrows
You better keep your eye on the sparrow


Rugged rhymsters, crooked crimesters
Dime droppers, Twenty-five-to-lifers
Backstabbers, low blowers
Illegal... cocaine growers
Starvation, profanity
Anxiety, brothers trying me
Gun slingers, dead ringers


"Have integrated a number of corrupt cops, judges and lawyers
Into high-level positions  to insure the continued success
Of the drug smuggling and money laundering operations"




Yo... yo... yo... yo, yo


Time to knock 'em out, cut 'em with the glass hand
Time to shut 'em down, I'm coming out the badland
Oscar the Grouch, kid, jumping out the trashcan
The last man that violated, got chopped with the sword
Send him a one way express ticket to see the Lord
You think we falling off, the beef's internal
All that bullshit we going through, it don't concern you
I'll thermonuclear burn you, you'se a human sacrifice
Cuz I be smashing mics with the Passion of Christ
Stay fully loaded, equipped with action devices
Kid, stashing these stripes, join the force
Honey, take ya flick, lift and point to the boss, soon
As you blink, your coins is tossed
It only takes four bars to get my point accross
And I'm cold as winter frost, on top of the mountains
Elijah, was the prophet, along came Malcolm
And I'm scalping niggas, taking devil's heads
Money generated, niggas taking heavy bread


I was born in a barrel of razor blades
Right next door to haze, I used to be afraid
Of the devil, as a boy, but now as a grown man
I realized, he is just a toy
A grafted image, of the magnificent splendid
Dominant, prominent, Islamic
I was here before the dinosaurs, shine and defining law
Measure every inch of the Earth, combining more
Elements and chemicals, fire, space, and minerals
Kept devils on the run, like Monk-Monk the General
Appear in a gang attire, slept in a ring of fire
I, got a bigger beat than Billy Squier
Dirty Dick Dastard' dart, straight out the dungeon
Transform on niggas like the rail whip from London
Paul Bunyan ax tracks, get peeled, caps back
Hard to get out, nigga, head like naps
Parental advisory, no M.C. is wisin' me
Me and the mic, like, ebony and ivory
We go together, like, cheese and cheddar, like
Jeans and sweater, like, Mo' and better, like
Who could take a sun ray, twist it to a rainbow
Darts sit upon your head like the Kangol
V is for Victory, I mastered your trickery
Tryna clock like dickory, get smoked like hickory
So please stop the bickery, you can't get rid of me
Wu Killa Bee, from now to infinity


Look at this bitch ass, snitch ass, about to get a kicked ass
Get mad, get smashed, and get another zip bag of 'dro
For these ho niggas, slow niggas, told niggas
Fucking with the coal miner's daughter, she a gold digger
Killa, I'm back iller, been realer, chinchilla
Coat, ex-crack dealer, cap peeler, dope
Uncut coke, cut throat, niggas had enough dough
What up, though? My nigga, I don't trust no bitches
That's real shit, feel this, vanilla Dutch and steel lick
Forensics is still tryna figure how I killed it
Wu-Tang, my crew bang, let our nuts hang
Like that piece on a new chain, mami, pop the poontang
Your party, find me where the stars be, or probably
Walk into the corner store on Targhee
Smokin' Bob Marley's, I'm hardly, a nigga to be fucked with
And you tryna 'catch up, but you barely cut the mustard, aight then


Just another spine chiller, U-G, RZA
M-A-S-T, A-K-Illa, M-E-T-H, O-D gorilla, straight from the Killa
Brownsvillah, do or die Bed-Stuy
Murderer, East terrorist, we clap gun thunderist
Land of the Iron Gods, swords can't live
Medina stay warrior, how can I escape the block
From being boxed off, lost in the shuffle of life
Living right cost, legendary crime boss
Fresh kicks drip in the street, beautiful unique
Freestyle, be so wild, fresh out the Penal
Track it on the Pro Tools, foul, smooth as blue nile
Wave spin, water blend, dart flow, sun glow
Kool Moe Dee roll, gang up on a power show
Snoop never love a ho, bang it on in your vehicle slow
You don't know how the God be flipping the style
And keep it so, Witty Unpredictable
Truth or Natural, the Gods is actual
It's a fact, I was destined, to grab the mic and bless them




Roll up, (pop them motherfuckers)
(It's a wrap), yeah, (it's a wrap)
Short story, (actual actual)
For y'all faggots, (homo niggas)
Get in line, (stand up)
Throw your hands up (fire in your ear)
Yeah, knowhatimsayin, (true indeed)
God, you the first, (sing it baby), spit!

 (Leathafase)
The hot fly shit, do or die forces
Motion detectors, alarmed in the fortress
(More of this, blow the door frame off the henges
Columbian drug lord) Part time business
Ties with the civic, build a house out in Venice
Six A.M., will have the heart to playin' tennis
(His name was with jealous, they finance the figures
Attended your figure) Close the book on the sinners


When the hammer snap, heat claps (it's a wrap)
Niggas want the streets back (it's a wrap)
Son, we off the meat rack (it's a wrap)
Slick slang, speak that (it's a wrap)


When the smoke clears, the hell fire flares
Twenty gorilla killas, runnin' down spiral stairs
To the bible I sware to complete the contract
(Slugs in slow motion, pierce and contact
Fierce in combat, killin' flow level
Runnin' up your threshold) Gunnin' down rebels
Plottin' down revenue, a score to settle
Post it up by the door with the gorgeous metal




Now you're paranoid, sniffin' the yae (clippin' the SK)
Clip a cigar hash (in a marble ashtray)
Grip these chains and kiss the cross on his necklace
Pop the rocket launcher, blew a new engine
(If it's all respected, how we deaded the suplier
He's wired up, bullets don't phase, and we fired up)
Return fire, blew over toothpaste, scalped 'em
Off the balcony 




With his last breath, this die hard villain
(Let off a hundred shots, took a chunk out the ceiling)
Revealing the coke stash, with snow in the mansion
(Reflections of the fire base, glowed on his hand gun)
Shots flyin' random, let the lead spray
(Sun, he shot me) But I aimed for his head
(Flame off lead, point the sword into his ribs)
Spoke his final words (He held a picture of his kids)
In the mixture of the biz (the shotgun impact)




 (Leathafase)
Fool, you can't beat that (it's wrap)




Motherfucker, it's a wrap




Machine gun Rap for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, linebacker nigga flash stacks
See through yellow lines, rock a fly jersey in the summertime
God, magic marker rap, bleed betadine relaxed
Wrote this, coming at you crab ass culprits
Snatch ya ice off, chilling in the back, throw the lights off
Waves, water blend, rhyme flow in slow motion
Thick snare, I'm feeling like a snail in the ocean
What's your wish? Wanna Kringle like Kris? Melodic single darts
Snap a nigga just like fish, you fucked up
Some rich niggas you done test, yo
Select the wrong apartment and niggas pulled up your dress
Style, molest that, Canal chain, nigga where ya vest at?
Flex'll make me wanna bless that, yo
Saddam Hussain niggas, light the torch, we flaming niggas
Autograph that, flatten all the main niggas


(It's Yours!)
The world in the palm of your hand
(It's Yours!)
Twenty-three million of useful land
(It's Yours!)
The seed and the black woman
(It's Yours!)
Double LP from Wu-Tang Clan
(It's Yours!)


Yo, super freak physique like Raphael Saadiq
Baby love the ganja leaf everyday of the week
Super friends wake up, deluxe gourmet beats
The night is right, I might find me a suite
It's a quarter full moon, I arrive, women swoon
Well groomed, dance hall packed, full room
Lady move, peep my glide, peep my zoom
Keep in stride, smoke the lye smoke the boom
Feel the fumes, consume toxic tunes
Hell bound, species forty ounce typhoon
The ultra-violet scream machine move your body touch
The totem pole wobble, Ark builders, God's thrust
Beams of light, stop ya breathing, it's hunting season
Honey eye-balling down for no reason
Grab her close, play post, wind and wax floors
Never mind the laws cause tonight It's yours


Stop the fader of the RAM, blast more watts through my pre-amp
Them can't stress the beat vamp the shit'll get blamp
At full throttle, hot lead propels throughout my nozzle
Crack your soul like bottles, leave you stiff as models
You fag, you couldn't pull one drag off my blunt
You couldn't punch your way out of a wet paper bag
With scissors in your hands bitch the RZA
I stand close to walls, like Number 4 The Lizard
And channel through solar panels, blast off like Roman Candles
Rap vandals, stomp your ass like Wahoo McDaniel
You cocker spaniel dogs, can't fuck with our catalog
Put your lights out and leave your brain inside a fog


It's only natural, actual facts are thrown at you
The impact will blow trees back and crack statues
Million dollar rap crews fold, check the sick shit
Explicit, I crystallize ya rhyme till you can sniff it
We live this, fitted hats low conceal the crooked eye
No surprise, verbal stick up, put 'em high
Rebel I outlaw, split second on the draw
Blow the door off this shit like bricks of C-4




Check out my beaver, baby blue Glock in the safe
Seen Dorothy in the garden getting ski row eight
We hold a belt Son, that's my word
Spot a rapper run him down, throw him out in the third, yo check it
I think like the man behind a register
Evergreen smoking estates, Divine and Power made me treasurer
With third down, six to go flash his strobe lights
I'm open, RZA hit me off lovely and I love him
With root beer thoughts, here's a tennis court for your birthday
The babyface of Rap politic with Sade
Avenging eagle crooks, rock the "W" and "Spiegel" books
Anheuser-Busch kings came through and stopped your whole Juks
Spitfire Kangols, watch Tony train a gang of hoes
Painful like hearing the news, like when your man go
Ends blow, windy at times watch the room
Sexy girl love the shit out the song, now watch her water break




I'm sorry, Jenny, I made you cry, I tried
I'm sorry, Jenny, all the pain inside, I lied
I'm sorry, Jenny, I made you cry, I tried
I'm sorry, Jenny, for all the pain inside...


We started as friends, you had a boyfriend
I took you from your man, that's the way we began
I didn't think it would come back to me in the end
That wasn't part of the plan, you had my heart in your hands
I guess broken wings, are hard on a man
You ran back to scrams, had me stuck in a jam
I didn't understand, where we went wrong
I tried to block you out, but you call on the phone
I want to, bad to the bone, all to myself, all alone
You sighed on the line, then I heard a dial tone




Yo, I stayed up so late, just, thinking of you
I wish that I can take back, all the pain we been through
On the path by myself, my back's on the wall
Sometimes I want that I shouldn't have met you at all
I told you if you just, leave the man you was with
I'll take you back in my life, and we'll seek happiness
Then you finally did, I took your heart for a ride
I didn't tell how, I had a chick on the side
It's been a couple of months, in this triangle of love
I didn't realize, she was the one that I want




Now was I young, was I dumb? Was I wrong?
I had thought we had a special bond
Come back, run, come back, run
I thought we was tight as a blood
What is love? What is love?






When it comes to this rap shit, not a stranger
Not Cedric, but Im a Entertainer
Game changer, none can match it
Im a Master, I throw on the green jacket
Takes practice, just to blaze mics
Im in the best shape of my life
In fights with God vs. Devil
Imma beat them charges, Im the hardest rebel
Im beyond your level, Im stone and grit
Sit back, let me Quincy Jones this shit
Blown to bits, this is my territory
My biographys an amazing story
Of blood and streets, love and deceit
Slugs and heat, let the dog off the leash
Im a free MC, not DMC
No contracts, contact TMZ


Here I go (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Im on my way (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Here I go (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Im on my way (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)


Tour bus, Orca, big shark walker
Man with the ammo, yall bring the grand piano
Fitted hat on, superfly, walk around
Shoot around your town like Hawaii Five-Oh
Oprah come out your projects, Im down with The Sopranos
While Im stealin em, head so big like balloon helium
Guns with body suits, energize off poets
See the king of kings, I manage Floyd Mayweather now
Come up to the condeminium
And shake hands with the new millennium
Larry and Armstrong insurance, me and U-God
Any rapper come up, better speak to the doorman
Throwing rice on the city, out the Carolina box
Captain hat, finger popping your lady with the Air Nike shots
Heavyweight, dumped around my waist, I took it years ago from John Tate




Rap hall of fame, yall mention me
Got more bars then a penetentiary
In the next century, you gonna see my spark
My rap IQ is right off the charts
Go and front, go ahead plot
You got the biggest gun dont mean you cant get shot
Check my slot, check my melody
You cant beat me, Im the champ of this melody
Speaking felonies, thats where Im drivin
Golden Arms venom, baggy jeans denim
Enemies, yo, I dodge for a living
And all these women, gotta stay ahead of ya
Yall want ballers, the hell with the regular
Yeah, yeah, whatever, kid, gotta keep your head sharp
Mind on the run, yall got a head start
Yall know the repertoire, fingers on the triggers
We the toughest niggas in the yard






When it comes to this rap shit, not a stranger
Not Cedric, but Im a Entertainer
Game changer, none can match it
Im a Master, I throw on the green jacket
Takes practice, just to blaze mics
Im in the best shape of my life
In fights with God vs. Devil
Imma beat them charges, Im the hardest rebel
Im beyond your level, Im stone and grit
Sit back, let me Quincy Jones this shit
Blown to bits, this is my territory
My biographys an amazing story
Of blood and streets, love and deceit
Slugs and heat, let the dog off the leash
Im a free MC, not DMC
No contracts, contact TMZ


Here I go (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Im on my way (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Here I go (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Im on my way (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)


Listen, I'm the talk of the town
(Who's that?) Vast Aire, I am beyond sound
It doesn't get iller, thrilla in manilla
This is Can Ox, Kool Keith and U-Godzilla
(We about that scrilla) New York's finest
Life's a bitch, so I had to drill her
I'm sick like salmonella
Stupid, I drop albums without no filler
In actuality, the bitch chose me
How you getting mad when that's pimp rule 3
How you getting mad when she called me?
You saw it happen to Tyson, we keep the messages
I don't got beef, I wave my hand
The Original Man from Arabian sands
Bleed twice and my mic is on
This Ox, Tang and Dr. Octagon


Here I go (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Im on my way (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Here I go (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Im on my way (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)


Tour bus, Orca, big shark walker
Man with the ammo, y'all bring the grand piano
Fitted hat on, superfly, walk around
Shoot around your town like Hawaii Five-O
Oprah come out your projects, Im down with The Sopranos
While Im stealin em, head so big like balloon helium
Guns with body suits, energize off poets
See the king of kings, I manage Floyd Mayweather now
Come up to the condominium
And shake hands with the new millennium
Larry and Armstrong insurance, me and U-God
Any rapper come up, better speak to the doorman
Throwing rice on the city, out the Carolina box
Captain hat, finger popping your lady with the Air Nike shots
Heavyweight, dumped around my waist
I took it years ago from John Tate


Here I go (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Im on my way (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Here I go (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Im on my way (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)


Universal verses given through unique ways
And speech forward and rapid
After hooks with an unusual reach
Some fumble unstable on how to receive
But never disputing the mystique
Sudden movements to fecal team
Blew reefer in long-gated hoodies with sneakers
Seeked by these
Secretly informed by agents that speaker these
Within a scenery of G's that move in to speak with me
In vicinity of imagery seen vividly
And absorbed deep within the subconscious
Establishing mentality
Having reality breath
Occurrence as patterns repeat
Endurance is what matters and deems
Kings the wrath from me


Here I go (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Im on my way (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Here I go (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)
Im on my way (Im the talk of the town, talk, talk of the town)




Watch out, here it come, that's the spirit, son
I can feel it in the air, I'm feeling young
Not here to fight, we call it fun
Allah gave me light, real strong
Meet me at the top, near dawn
Damn right, nope, we always kill songs


Momma gave birth, righteous seed
Tension in the hood, it's alright with me
Flows laid down with lightning speed
The track game good, it's alright with me
I'mma keep dropping albums, each year
Fold y'all niggas, beach chair
I told y'all niggas, it's heat here
Watch how y'all step, watch your feet there
You blocking the shine of the chief here
It's Keynote Speaker, leap year


Watch out, here it come, that's the spirit, son
I can feel it in the air, I'm feeling young
Not here to fight, we call it fun
Allah gave me light, real strong
Meet me at the top, near dawn
Damn right, nope, we always kill songs


Relentless, hustle, respect the fullest
I'm ready, set, see my extra bullets
I'm on deck, see, I'm next to do it
My nest is blooming, my heart is fuming
What you expect, man? The God is human
I'm next to do it, my brain is fluid
This is my anger, it's chamber music, now
Here we are, to spank and bruise it, now
Middle finger, if you think we lose it
But you like it 'cause you choose it
You can't coach me out my style
I'm the millennium poster child
Put in years, move at a slow pace
As I watch y'all spit with no taste


Watch out, here it come, that's the spirit, son
I can feel it in the air, I'm feeling young
Not here to fight, we call it fun
Allah gave me light, real strong
Meet me at the top, near dawn
Damn right, nope, we always kill songs




Driving down the strip, and you see my spokes
And I rip off my shirt, like he's the Hulk
And I squeeze off volts, just to please your folks
And hip hop, yeah, needs a jolt
Then you fall to your knees, when I squeeze your throat
Cuz these hip hop fiends, they need they dope
And I puff on weed, then I blow out smoke
He's so feroc', now here's a dose
Now throw it to the left coast, whatchu expect, bro?
I let my tech blow, no, it ain't techno
You get your neck broke, python strong
You want problems, now bring it on


Hear the sounds of the titans clash
Sucker M.C.'s try to bite this fast
Jody gon' put it on smash
It'll happen so fast, kick ass
The rap world thought that Wu won't last
Sucker D.J.'s keep playin' that trash
Jody gon' put it on blast
It'll happen so fast, kick ass


I been through 'nuff shit, and I paid the cost
Now I wear big hats, like I'm the boss
Knock you off your high horse, with no remorse
In hip hop, there's no need to floss
Those who don't believe, I leave you scorched
Peel out in the porsche, with dual exhaust
U-God is the name, the game is torched
Upside your head, you get banged with force
Throw it to the left coast, whatchu expect, bro?
I let my tech blow, no, it ain't techno
You get your neck broke, python strong
You want problems, now bring it on





Mommy... Daddy...
It's the Killa Beez....


You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious


Yo yo
I was born with this magnet, warned by the dragnet
About my dirty habits, I got to have it, the super-glow
Deuce Bigelow - Male Gigolo
Gold hands crush Coke cans and Michelobs
Style is Nino, black Benzito, Valentino
Nine needles - voice; evil steelo
Hit, like the bull, more pull than Magneto
Crush kilos with my bare hand, reload the Eagle
Nine dirty strikes, leaped up off all you people
Burn therapy, chemo, seap hoes
See you through the peephole - in the crime lab
Countin Ginos, cut-tin dime slabs
Then he bagged up Chino, rushed through the crowd with a hee-ho
Slapshots, jackpots, and pe-nnals
Throw graffiti on the wall, throwin up Reemo
Gambino three dice, headcrack Cee-Lo
In ya earhole, let the snare roll go low
Lower than low, lower than zero
Who's your rhymin heroes? *heavy breathing*
("Killa beeeeeeeeeeees?")


You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious


Bzzzz.. you hear the hornet, you ducks don't want it
I dogs blast turbo, supersonic
Hats off, welcome back, whipe the sweat off
Bobby Digital, half-man and half-cyborg
NY City, home of the fly bitties
With high-heel shoes and tattoos on side titties
Shorties swallow up the apple cider
Ra' doin a buck forty in the yellow Spyder
With the black interior, my mack superior
To your theory of gats, up in the cafeteria
I used to cut class and bang lunch tables
With four finger weaves and long chunky gold cables
Now I'm known to smack drum machines, carry +Guillotines+
Watch my bullets scream ("Pheeewwwwww!") and hit the target
You can't trace the path of air from which it started


You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious


It's the return of the bad boy, the mic Sean Penn
Floss gems across the globe with my nine Swordsmen
At a speed that excedes your convertible Benz
From a distance you glimpse, supernocular lens
Stay hotter than a ex-con dodgin the pens
Killa Squadron, known to start a popular trend
And the emblem, symbolize the wisdom
Certifies the platinum, magnifies the stardom
Shots bust at random, wake you out your boredom
Kings of our kingdom, reppin from our hoodlums
Gotta whip them problems, cuz yo we step on toes
Bangin heads knockin teeth loose, welcome to the pros
Flash quiz, do that nigga handle his biz?
I spin a song like Michael and Diana in the Wiz
The rough shit, I bust it for the republic
Government, you ain't lovin it, whatchu fuckin wit?
Manifesto, light it like a techno club
Outsiders don't expect no love
Man this grip, make the fans flip, don't chance it
Cop the goods, while my hundred hoods run rampid


You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious






"Esto no me gusta. Aqu la gente, la gente no sirve pa' mierda
Aqu yo soy, yo soy Capitn Pingaloca. Y to' mundo aqu
Me sirve a mi o va pa'l carajo. Oye... revolucin compadre!"


In the midst of the madness no question, who's the baddest
MC's in the game runnin for the status
Take a few seconds to review the crews
Sittin on top is the Hill lookin over you
Killa Hill Niggas, cream in my dream
Cookin up a scheme for all them big bank figures
The world is yours, but it can be mine and his
Bust you out the frame, I don't give a fuck who it is
Number one mission, opposition
Get thrown sent home in dead position
In the casket, best wishes
At the bottom of the lake, sleepin with the fishes
Full out search for the body
Of the MC's who be comin to disrupt the party
No wins, no ends, no way
That I'm ever gonna let ya come back again!


Check my dramatics, brains get splattered, dreams shattered
Sabas get blasted for words he packaged
Peep the sequence; crab adolescents, on his defense
Power-U niggas talkin fast like Puerto Ricans
What you seekin, son I catch cream like Dominicans
Last Mohican, lyrics I'm speakin, wild as Indians
Tomahawk - Shaolin slang, the violent talk
Upstate New York, where chumps get extorted for Newports
What you thought?


Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
- that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
.. that that that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
- that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back, ease back
Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
- that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again


"Y ya est dicho. Todos los que no les guste mi 'rebote' van a morir
Yo le voy a meter una bala a la cabeza a cualquier maricn
Que no me persiga a mi a la 'singadapuerta'. Oye, hijo de puta!
Quiero quemarte la cara!"


Words drop in chant, the cheeky-eyed slant
I'm takin these cannabis plants yo for grant'
Exotic, narcotic, tunes slam soon
From a dune in the desert Mega-Babylon pleasure
Comin out the domepiece, smell my aroma
Warrior nomad, put you in a coma
Comma, llama, smash-crashin your armor
Drama, I'm a, stealth aircraft bomber
Here is where I dwell at the gates o' hell
It ain't where you're from it's where you're in the mentals
And if not yo, credentials are essential
I see reality, few things surroundin me
Three like a spread, precise strikes the lyric
Not frontin or braggin, hundred percent red dragon
Pine fragranced lyrics, the rhymes you can't imagine
The globe-trotter, call me Meadowlark Lemon
Five part criminal, two part felon


- that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
.. that that that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
- that that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
- that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back.. ease back..
Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
- that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger..


"Esto es muy antiguo. Esta dicho! Aqu, la revolucin! No se va a ver por televisin
Todos los maricones del norte, que los voy a matar yo
Va a ser aqu en nuestro pas. Y todos los 'singamasones'
Que estn chingando el mundo. Tambin, van a ver la muerte
De ellos mismos, en las manos de ellos. Un da, va a ser sangre
Mucha sangre. La peste de los cuerpos muertos, van a or
Que se va a hueler hasta los Estados Unidos, estos cabrones
Que con la democracia, que nos 'tan chingando en el culo
Todos son unos mismos cabrones..."




They told me, what happened, alright
You're still young, and things like that always happen
When you'll learn, then you'll know not to make those mistakes


Really? These dudes don't want it with Deck, no, my set glow
Hate it or you love it, but you gonna respect though
You ain't got to know my name, check the blood, sweat & tears
For years, niggas know I bang
I'm a made nigga, caking what you call a boss
On my own two, never taking orders from ya'll
What I spit, get the corners involved, it's wreck on the yard
It's House Gang, son, it's more than hard
The life that'll glamour and glitz, best believe
On the flip side, nigga, it's them hammers and clips
Wanna live in high fashion and rich, so we scramble the strip
Camouflage, with they hand on the grip
Ain't nothing gon' stop kid from getting his due
No, your feets not big enough to fit in his shoe
I don't rock what you rap, niggas, they be pole
On 'The Wire,' just not HBO
They under fire, edge around the way we know
They know they time up, guess that's why they hate me so
But yo, they will never take me though, I had to go like
Montana, licking, sniffing crazy blow
Still I be Hard to Kill like Seagal
Warrior built, big shield and long sword
One Six Ooh'ing it, doing it, king size
Salutations, that's respecting the king eyes
For those that follow my lead, attract to the light
At the same time, marvel the speed
I'm so dope, I can bottle it free
The most influential, modern day murderous he


Yo, deep in the bungalo, chopping the motherload
Carving my own path, taking another road
I need a son to soul, he brought the troops with him
It sounds presidential, I got the truth serum
Don't want the booth near him, respect in the sabotage
I'm on the patio, stretched in my camouflage
And my grammar's hard, the Wolverine skeleton
I be the yellow man, snatching on the other brand
But on the other hand, light up the darkness
I'm stir fried, nigga, yeah, I'm heartless
My apartment is a hole in the wall, nigga
Pass me the rock, stop holding the ball
I told you before, under worser conditions
Chessboxing, nigga, mic's a dead body position


Aiyo, it's time to make cash dinero
I'm going to the Summer Jam concert to bash your hero
Lie up in your bedroom, smash your bureu
We looking for the money, man, pass the Euro
Apartment to pesos, pass the yen
And, we don't want to have to ask again
Cuz we ain't gon' be laughing then
These three men, take on your whole staff and win
Look, labels stay messing with a cat's future
And that weighs on me heavy like Rasputia
But I still keep spitting like a shortshop
I'mma be sitting at the table when the cork pop
You gon' be sitting at the table with a porkchop
Lacking on the beat like a short cop
It's your boy Ace, BK's own
All you ringtone rap dudes, please stay home, come on




But I love the way... that you carry yourself...
Even love the way... you wear your hair...
Ain't that loving you' (Ain't that loving you')
Baby, ain't that loving you' (Ain't that loving you')
Baby, for more reasons than one...


Roses are red, violets are blue
On one knee sucking your hips, up in your poo, boo
Got a flu, cuz I'm loving your candy lips
Tight as a glove, when we lock, understand me, miss
We made love in our socks, Hawaii was our last trip
Water splash the ass, right between the rocks
Dreamy fox, your hard nipples, yo, I kissed them
As if a spring fountain came running through like sprinkler systems
Your eyes twinkle, I'm your victim
Your hot jacuzzi love, unplugged, Stephanie
Her pops, don't like black people, that's why she left me
Especially, fucked me, test me, then stressed me


You got some tig ol' bitties, you every bit of pretty
You come from Cakillac, or just to see me in the city
You got the oh my goodness, you got the oh my goodness
You bootylicious, ma, your doggystyle is oh my goodness
I see your nipples peaking, I got Victoria off the hook
No she telling every local single secret
You sweating and you moaning, I'm wetting and I'm grown in
I'm biting my lip, ma, your head game got me zoning
Wanted to thug you at first, now I love you the worst
Every man in his right mind, wanna fuck you on Earth
Your fragrance got me floating, your patience got me open
The type of dame to give you brain, playing video games and smoking
Forever and a day, my love song, my babe
The love jones'll stay, when you love zones a way
Forever and a day, love song, my babe
Love jones'll stay, love zones the way


I let love slip away...
Now all that I can say...
Is hear the toast to a better day...


This is King Toast Queen, we touch glasses
Sipping the finest imports, burn murs and Love Supreme


Peace to my forefathers, stories of King Solomon
Autobiography, momma, this is my reference
Been up north twice, avoided the pins on the last setting
Ghetto cambaret, watered down charteney
Not only brought up, aknowledge yourself
Momma said you my boy, so avoid the negative gassing
Ain't no future in flashing, everyday struggle, who asking'
I live amongst snitches, who love when po-nine kept
Who was in the projects blasting, old timers
Whispering how I'm a dead man standing, a star of the track heads
Pushing stolen video parts, God body, but still love criminal parts
The girls ate pork, all winter then had asses in the summer
Millionaire dollar run-up, rolling on the roads that Allah paved
Word around the hood, Mary J. Blige would say
Solomon Childs, ghetto celebrity, top grade, nuh...


I let love slip away...
Now all that I can say...




Yo! This is K.J., all day, every day
Around your way, in your hallway
Puffin' ganje, Hillside Scrambled eggs..
Let's go... let's go... let's go..
K.J. rhyme, all day, every day, let's go..


Prepare for a Battlestar Gallectica, this is Attica
America, home of the Chainsaw Massacre
Dracula, sink my teeth into this beat
And sleep on corners where you drug dealers meet
Stay out of reach, but I keep arm distance
We can't hold him down, cuz I'm just too persistant
Listen, nitroglycerin, finish him
Kryptonite for all you fuckin' Supermen
It's him again, and I'm feelin' fine
Watch where you walk, you might step on landmines
Tech nine crime, quote him line for line
Intertwine with a mind like Albert Einstein
Optimus prime, throw heat like the sun
I got fees in this rap, why you think I'm on the run?
And when it's all said and done, I'm handlin' my biz
All the kids around the world is gonna is, is


Nobody rhymes like K.J. rhymes
Nobody, K.J. rhyme


Now which one of ya'll could do it like I?
I guess you the reason they put "pumpk" in the pie
Quicker sea fry, hang glide slide
K.J. go way-way like pantry pie
Zebra Lounge crowd, yo, that's Lounge
If I ain't put it down by the ramp with 18 pound
Cherry jubilee, hang off roofs like D.P
Ever since Champ God robbed the fuckin' Mickey D's
Ya'll was scarred and needed reincarnation of jackpot
Stop frontin', cuz you got the hip hop Scott 'Rock
Face lock the shot, we got the studio booked
Look up your history, I'm still off the hook
It's Mark Twain, I'm rollin' like Oliver Twist
Back now, to smackdown shit that you missed
Kiss where the sun don't shine, bottom line
Ya'll niggas better hope I don't get a deal and sign




You the Mick Dynamite or Mr. Excite
You've been rappin' for a long time but don't sound right
Not quite as the hype that you recite
Mr. All-Day, I'll do it to your ass night
On sight, I smash anything you write
With K-9 teeth for niggas who bagpipe
Walk to the light and bring your mic
You won't last one minute in a ten round fight
The Al-Qada type that'll snipe your windpipe
Siege your general, and strip him of his stripes
Either you men or mice, you gon' still pay the price
You either take my advice, or roll the dice
Real life, still trife, walk with a gun
Talk with a knife, double c.d., so you can buy me twice
On tight, and you just might take flight
M.C.'s got left, why you think they not right
Hang glide like a kite, on the turnpike
With two bitches, that's some Dick Van Dyke
Pay-per-view satellite, there's a need to feed my appetite
Pick up your weight, cuz you ain't got the hype
Battle me, your need an invite, black or white
And I'll still drink a forty with ice
I still smoke a leaf joint from Spike, ight?
I'm the reason why Coca-Cola had to fuckin' remix the Sprite
He's nice, and taste like Chinese rice
And from shit on the stick, he the pastry whites
You the Latter Day Saints, I'm the Poltergeist
I'm the whole damn pie, nigga, you just a slice
This is a heist, I suggest you remove your ice
Before you be up in close and person over Christ
Get on your Big Wheel bike and take a hike
Cuz around these parts, you not liked
Parasite, don't have me flex my mic
I don't rock Air Force One's, I call it Air Strikes (*echoes*)




Way!
No way!
No way!
No way!
No way!




You asked for the rap action pack satisfaction
Snatch over match kiss the grand dragon
I'm tramplin the mass riddin head champion
Back draft crash landin
Last man standing
All bodies full of swords
Cards of confusion
Killa bee guarntee
The guilotine execution
Reviloution air pollution
New budda diva fairy, beaver, be cleaver, fever, curry speaker
Sweet creature hurry knockin
Dirty rockin jockin
One stand word is thirty shell shockin
Unlockin fell through the flurries
Hurry, don't worry cherry blow
Go beyond wall rip a hardcore

Y'all really want the fuckin war
Golden Arms bringing the swell
Somebody knockin at the door
Somebody brinin the swell
Young guns down for the cause

Last hope Staten force, stack a few thoughts
Burn a mens courts
German imports adapt to the sport
Smash your courts like elevator deaths
Hell raizer checks
Shells faith invest it dwells in the plate in your chest
Facial sweats away in your breath
Scrapin your best patriot blessed warzone
No escapin the death
Snake you inject venom from poison glands
Boy scans destroy mans
The only survivor if the weak hold jams
Boths mans a pyrex measuring cups
Fo' better bust permanent headrush
Body illustrius
Infamous selfdestruct 12 bomb mechanisms
Expertism sets down your power gland systems


Somebody rockin hardcore

Disco daddy caddy shack
Glad he back, novelty size
Swallow me in poverty pimpin
Finger lickin hood stricken
Muffle detect slide
Shuffle the deck muscle respect, good riddens
Rag time drag through
36 pistons jerk your wrist in friction
Crash y'all since you in fast ball
And gas your last ass-whippin
Ask canned equipment
Risky district sound effect
Kickbox to get lift the gold shipment
The upmost control cut most amounted track
Polish my knaps

The crypt tall bricks hit em'
Rip torn the bits got flipped shredded then chipped over dicer


Someone knockin at the door

Ghostface: Alright, scrungy-head motherfuckers


Lay on the crime scene, sipping fine wines, pulling nines on
UFOs taking they fly clothes, they eyes closed
We getting loot, no doubt, check the word of mouth
Unheard about, guns go off, and now I murder route
I'm out, my raps play the part, like a Get Smart secret agent
In a maze and style's blazing
Johnny Blaze and Tony Starks in a daze and
And Rhyming, my nigga Lou Diamond with Robert F
We like Meth to go and fuck with Noodles
Having them poodles on the lockdown, buying me
Amarettos and chewables, smacking pharmecuetical
Rap niggas on dust and woos
Yo, I told you, some killed, robbed and fold
The goal's untold, fuck it, it beats parole
So stroll marvelous, soul controller of the whole globe
Goddamn I got it sewn and yo
What up wop? Pop the suitcase high and we can talk
You can walk out the fucking building and get caught
Save the fully inflatable, rap relatable
Drug relatable, niggas here to play with you
A hundred dollar Rottweiler, go to spot sellers
Guns and Glocks for them niggas who got props
Off top jail niggas get mad bigger and yo
Mail a guy about a hundred pictures
Word to mama, this rap wonder rhymer team got drama
Comma, blunt smoke real ass marijuana
Chef Maranzano boats across the Verrazano
Immaculate, bust off my gun's so accurate
And get cream in the cuisine of Queens
I told you Money skated with night beams and two rings


Crazy fag, I'm getting ready to do this shit
(Sniff mad shit)
Man, niggas know not to step on this shit


Who's the knucklehead, wanting respect?
Chop his fingers in the drug game, Money well known
Lead singer, humdinger, flash is the aftermath, here's his photograph
Run up in his lab, take off the mask Chas and think fast
Don't laugh, bag the cash, grab the hash, don't forget his stash
Grab the tear gas and place it in his face fast
At full blast 
Then skate to the next gate further upstate
I heard they got crazy weight, bagged up by the cakes in
Crates like disco breaks, yo look out for Jakes
Give it all it takes, let's burn the place before we motivate
Yo, Blake, niggas don't fake, rape his mate
If the bitch scream, for God's sake grab the grey tape
It's by the plate with the blow crushed up with the flakes
Killer snakes, four bodies found floating in lakes
Drug related paper talking about the kids who didn't make it
Hits without a trace, never seen the bricks, see Rae and Ghostface
Congratulations Chef, let's celebrate and sniff an eighth




The rap star is born
Rap Parmesan, put it on, seal it on
We're silicone, spark it on your talkathon
This rap phenomenon, two corresponds
Took the arms, hit me on the hip and horns, rap chaperone
Scars tone, bars thrown, war tones, raw tones
Blowing out the door, bones, but
Your raps is fraudulent, plug in these rap coordinates
Is reinforced with suspense, be on your rap sword defense
These microphone professional, sensational
Fully operational, I got niggas here to play with you
You know the steez, you know my whole program
Brothers from the no-lands, all we want is the Gs, guns and grams
Living fat like the Hoffa, mafia, sipping, eating pastas
Laying in the house telling the seeds about the sagas
Before we got dramatic and thoughts got sporadic
We grabbed golden tablets and quick guarded the Abbots
Slugs hit the Pelle, put tokes into the belly
Suckers tried to knock me out the box like Skelly
I smoke the weed trees, I drop top to the breeze
Honey dip spending G's on nails and hair weave
The crime boss, taking no loss, excessive force
We can play the A-Train back of the iron horse


Raekwon: Yo, man, you know what I'm saying?
Ghostface: Fuck it man






(Verse One)
It be the Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
I got control drop a load
Time to rip shit
Time to rock and roll
I play the block and stroll
Stop and go, cop an old up town choppin
Choppin for dough, prophesize
Monopolize ingrown, pull back with no remorse
The horsepower cross bow
Soundin dope we off done the boat felt the flow
Under my belt plenty live
Twenty five in the front row
Just felt the glow, they melt wit in oxin
Rumble in the Bronx
Slugs out start buggin out
Thugs out, tuck they heats in your bucket seats
Honey's suckin me, sweet
Do a 90 in the jeep
Vainglorious, might stand victorious
A hundred story high historian
Poor men of the street
Jammed the game, to the poor again
Slander the Wu banner name it's war again
It's war again

(Hook)
**Gun cocking**
Lay down
**Bullets fire**
Mothafucka lay down
Lay down
Spray sounds
Spray sounds
Spray sounds

(Verse Two)
Subject to sing like the slasher slither
Better through a guy's status
Apparatus tied to your liver
Melon in never whither
Mount St. Helens swellin
Refreshin fearsome rebellious sellin death to ya eardrums
I'm never tellin, diary, just a firey felon
Coughins I'm nailin
All your frail men on a scale
Your deep space maybe's
Inject your offsprings wit the rabies
It's gravy train on the remy, dirty glass
Sponge kidney bath real pissy
Rendevous, wit the fisheys stats
Demolition derby, attourney to rap
Before the jury
A thirty six word remix
Firey phoenix turn tables wobble
Out the pre-cint shake the ground decent
Still waiting for impeachment I'm sea sick

(Hook)

(Verse Three)
Edit I, sexual predator
In the burn centre
Temper, pepper salt
Hashish master piece
Out the vault
Twenty seven years of hysteria, bury ya
In the gear of North America
Placenta crackin it's crisis
Kosovo tae-bo flow blow out the fo'
World trauma, who got the virus?
Pearl Harbour casino classic free loader
Weed smokin bastards
Gambinos on amino acid
Bio-hazards
Faster the groover the hoover vacume
The child spark remover sag em'
Passionate wars wit U-God the braska to Alaska
Pipe line the right by a massacre
Thought race your barriers
The air craft carriers severe
Spill your mascara dear
The skin lab
Tell your flex everywhere
Soon your words, scum dogs of the universe
When will you learn
You'll get burned

(Hook)

Tear it down




It's your time, baby, when it comes, it comes
I come down crashin' like a hundred tons
Run sound through you, if you want it grunge
Soak up the lyric like a human sponge
Slow down baby, don't jump the gun
Song sound crazy when he pump the drums
One's in my pocket, gators half ostrich
Style created by the 36 monsters
Sponsors in the building, franchise the concert
Snatch mob besmirched, watch the don work
Go berserk, tear off your shirt, the scenery
It's V.I.P., you can't lean like me


Song sound crazy when you pump the drums
Slow down baby, don't jump the gun
Straight from the slums to the V.I.P
It's the gangsta scene, you can't lean like me


Guess who's back just to blow your mind
Zero to nine, nigga, press rewind
In the ball room grind, on her fat behind
Throw it back when you wine cuz the meat is prime
I'm, too hot to handle, too cold to hold
Fresh off parole with a monster stroke
Soul control the dance floor, what more can you ask for?
Rush the back door, amped off the raw
The champ in valor, hammers galore
Off the wall, sweat cognac out the pores
Down by law, you won't make it to round four
Shake it, don't break it, what more can you ask for?




Blood style did the scenery
Blowin' on that greenery
Pushin' heavy machinery
It's the gangsta scene, you can't lean like me


It's the master of ceremonies, king of rump shakers
Back, it's the bold in the golden bracelets
Need to roll a facelift, you die if the paint chip
Hit the hydraulic, then I raise up the spaceship
Drop, off gracious, cuz you're obsolete
The twenty inch chrome blade chop up the street
On the shopping spree, for the chocolate tree
I stay tailgated by the unmarked beast
With the sticker on the bumper say "fuck the police"
When I pass, bury me gangsta with my gold teeth
The O.G., U.G.O.D., with the trophy
Switch my name to Jody, cuz Goldie's the old me







 + (Raekwon)
(Yeah, yeah) Aiyo, how much more for a fifth of Vodka? (Peace beloved)
(Six bottles of Henny, six bottles of Henn) Word, word, let me get that
Herb, yeah, yeah.. (bring that bucket here)
Yeah (get some ice, man, two more bottles of Cru', man, word up)


I've gone through life pretending
That time will change the ending


Peace to the God (peace God) pour out a little liquor
Shame On A Nigga, I heard the reaper done came to get ya
So I done copped a fifth of, Vodka, and in your honor
I've grown this fetish for loose ladies and baby mommas
Some say it's bad karma, what you do, man, it come back on ya
Music got us up off them crack corners
Now I'mma swallow this whole bottle for Ol' Dirty
Damn, it hurts me, I hate it when brothers go early




Word to my son, he gon' remember you, rubbing on a statue
In his lab, that resemble you, and what it meant to Wu
Us forming like a family, you just blew
You was the chess piece on the board, that made us look true
Watching your pen swish, you love frying kingfish
You the pearl in the ocean, I'm up on the land, pissed
Now you moving more prestigious, me, hitting this reefer
I know it's real, guess I slept with the Black Jesus




I became weak when I heard, that his body expired
It was hard for me to believe my brother retired
Suddenly the clock stopped and the room started spinning
How can he walk off the field during the first inning?
I cried like a baby on the way to his place of death
Hate not being there, the minutes before he left
Now I'm in the booth, ten feet from where he lay dead
I think about him on this song and what he might've said




When I first heard the word, I needed air to clear my head
I know you didn't say what I thought you said, my brother's dead
You crazy, another Dirty prank to get the family cranked
Ya'll niggas shouldn't play like that, I know how you feel
Lord, but it's real, and I still can't believe
And my heart still grieves the loss, there's no pretending
Ason Unique, loved wine and fine women
We singing on tour, "ooh baby, we like it raw"




Can't pretend...
Some day it gotta come to an end
But I'mma keep you right here dog, real close to my heart
Yeah...


I popped a bottle on your born day, God
Tried hard not to cry, I still can't hide the scar
And I still ask, why to God, analyzing your form
As I stood there beside your mom
And I share the blame, cuz you was calling for help, kid
Should've, would've, could've, had the time, I was selfish
I carry on your struggle, each day it really hurts me
I really miss you Russell, hope you forgive me Dirty




Yo, these walls I wanna crash, and put my fists through
Shout out to Dirty, let the whole world miss you
Reach out and kiss you in your coffin, my heart races
I dropped tears and watch my nigga fall from greatness
It's all wasted, flushed down the drain and
Soon as the news hit me, I bust out with pain and
Rivers I cried, my brother just died
I'mma see you, my nigga, on the other side




Ah, man, how do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones that have to die
It's hard to live without you, God, I shouldn't have doubted you
When you said that The Passion of Christ was all about you
From the God Mobile, to Linden Plaza, to Brownsville
Florida to Ohio, to Putnam, to Park Hill
You interrupt the Grammy's said "Wu for the kids"
Took four or five shots when they rushed in the crib
Trey-five-seven cracked ya ribs, cops shot ya whip
You've been chased by the pigs, sold the four year bid
Crashed cars, still came out without a scar
They tried to keep ya free spirit trapped in a jar
So you'll keep ya mouth shut, and not tell the world
Who's who and what's what, and probably go nuts
How we treat them hoes? Dirt, how we treat them hoes?
We fuck 'em in the butt, Dirt




But those mistakes behind me
Cast shadows to remind me

*gong bangs*
*Sifu Shi Yin Ming reciting the Heart Sutra*




Yo, yo, magnificent high score, master plan, the crowd roar
Throw up daily dosage, get ready for the down pour
Human cannonball, matador, standing next to door
Battle ya'll, sound more, get ready for the round four
Ground war, jigsaw, bearhug, bearclaw
Slimeball, crime bosses, you better count your losses
Dark lord, divorce court, hot sauce, the pen glide
Then fly, Bangkok, Chinese, Shanghai
Red wine, fed time, bring crime, the cake rise
Take mines, break spines, watch for them snake eyes
Break ties, shake thighs, watch how them dollars flow
Scholar's home, monotone, crush 'em on they collarbone
Cyclone, you styrofoam, up against the Wu brand
Big gun to hold it, it's gonna take two hands
Check the newstand, I'm running with the Manual
Flammable, animals, call me a dynamo
Hannibal on elephants, got you in a stranglehold
Black man legal Gambino and my bangles gold
Hand in the finger bowl, your face is on my chrome gauge
Strapped with a bomb, gonna blow you to the Stone Age


Woo ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooooh
Ay, ay, the way she shake it
Ay, ay, I can't take it
Ay, ay, the way she take it
Ay, ay, I can't shake it


Yo, ever ready wordplay, conscious survey
Mountains fall crumble, impact your chestplate
Heavyweight, ankles swing, therapy Bowflex
Snowman, cold kid, melt you in your gore-tex
Raw sex vibe, ultraviolet on the sex drive
Forty five wives, new silent with my tech nines
Respect mine in chalk line, smash for your drama talk
Backflips, somersault, chopped by the tomahawk
Pop off, mozoltov, stung by the voodoo
Old school, new school, invest like the Jews do
Your broke ass, no class, broadcast on YouTube
Fake boobs, handjobs, state troops to damn slobs
Hate you, fuck off, hate you with duck sauce
Feathers get, plucked off, when I cough with ink dust
Linked up, inked up, strokes from the paintbrush
Go for your taste buds, shrooms and I stay buzzed
Music for your forehead, smashed on your horse face
Wu on the warhead, crash through your tourgates




Scott knocks, is on the ball
Let's rock, she love the boss
Oh god, she loves the mutt
Jump up, and go for my mine
It's so deep, you get cross-eyed
Take that heat, and roll outside
Black handprints on the wall
Black handprints on the wall




I say I'm pimping, bitches on kneepads
Lipton, sipping the tea bag




Uh, yea
In my time, I've seen a lot of people come and go
A lot of new faces, been to a lot of new places
Wherever we went, we always held it down
While we conquered new grounds. It's a universal sound
The Witty Unpredictable Talent And Natural Game
Yo...


Not many last in the game
Wu-Tang come through, breakin out the same way we came
This is not an act, this is actual facts
Nothin but experience placed upon the tracks


We stand perpendicular with no flaws
Breakin all laws, plus jaws, the writin's on the walls
Heartless, starvin artists, out to get our's
Regardless, marvelous doctrines, we shock this
Fist of the black lotus, bustin out the steel cage
Iron Mic Duel made the front page
Outlaws, out for your's, get down on all fours
Rebel with a cause, without applause to the score
"Pillagin" with Donna-Cap, this persona raps
Hittin like a cornerback, blitzin' on the track
Fully-auto, got the mic blow, strike low
High-caliber flow move the crowd, twist your torso
2009, block party, Bobby Digital, pop corks to us
And the God's we trust, adjust
To the highs that we bring with the lows
In the midst of hell speakin out in morse code
Runnin wild like dogs out the kennel through the venue
Simple chemistry, vitamins plus the minerals
Organic vowels, consonants, syllables
Condition critical, ill individual
Paint a picture too vivid for the visual
Material rips through to the gristle




Yo, the messages in my music grab you, stuck in my sentence
Got to spit from the bottomless pit, speakin my vengeance
Masked avenger never surrender my heritage
Killah Hill resident, 5'10" be my measurement
On land we stand under flags as confederates
You think you rule, pity the fool when the shell drops, it's hot
Bodies scream to the extreme, damn, I'm delicate
We livin irrelevant, intelligent, dirty habit
They full of fragments, abandon all 10 commandments
Damage is done as the records spins, hatred in my features
Untamed, thus these cold blooded creatures bust
Architect gladiator radiates the power
Erupt with corrupt minds, locked in the tower
The crook's pressure cooked invasion be destroyed
Self-employed paranoid androids


My rhyme cold winds clear streets and slams shutters
Basic Instinct to tear the roof off the mother
Drastic verbal gymnastics, far from the average
Hold the planet like Galactus
Lone Ranger, ancestors rolled with stone bangers
Never met a force deadly as my own anger
Clutch performer, raised on the blood soaked corners
Of real life with real trife heads, they prey on ya
And not many last on the game
Whether it be lies, fly songs or drugs you slang
In the beginnin, it didn't come fast amongst the gun blast
Strivin, my eyes on lump sums of cash
Cash Rules Everything Around Me, surroundin me with champagne wishes
But I see long distance, a strong vision planted deep within the mental
Mind detect mind and analyze what I sent you






Uh-huh, Jones, one-two, one-two
G's up, you know who I am, Jones, the struggle
New York's mine


Can it be it was all so simple
Imagine me in the Porsche, when I spin thorugh
I lost my fitted when the wind blew
Down in Miami, when we floss, no Winstons
Looking for some ice cream, hooked on the night scene
Way back when Eric B. was a 'mic fiend'
What about the pipe fiends, got 'em in line
Sell 'em all pipe dreams, I was on my grind
Now I'm in my prime like 36 Chambers
Pull through your block with like thirty-six rangers
Don't say it, we dangerous, give a fair warning
Party til the morning, to the last call
Go hard, nigga, cuz when it rain it starts pouring
You a nigga sleep, like you snoring
My niggas creep like they crawling
Pray for you niggas, oh, lord, could you pray for this nigga?


See me ride and creep through the night in the fog
Heat's to your skull, cuz this time, it's on
(It's a jungle out here) Nowhere to run, you in the eye of the storm
Sing your goodbyes, cuz this time, you're gone
(Boy, we rumble out here) You want forgiveness, pray to the Lord
You live by the sword, you die by the sword
(It's a jungle out here) Kick down your door, show no remorse
Ah, fuck it, magnum force, get 'em


Yo, it's danger when the beat loops, hard like Sheek Louch
God got a sweet tooth for white broads and fleetwoods
Drive-by music, watch when the jeep swoop
Three wolves jumped out, armored up, neat roof
Them dudes eat fruit, pick it right, off the tree
Deep roots in the street, that's right, I'm a G
These boots don't walk from the Hill to France
Dunn, shout out to dance hall, gorilla stance
Make, killas glance, heads, start popping
Police just watch, hoes, start clocking
Foes can't block 'em, your spine is jelly
But mine is gully, my insides is ugly
And I shine with my hat low, behind the skully
It's Zilla, Zilla, with the monster belly
And my hands stay steady, I move in silence
But I'm, ready to live, nigga, Christopher Wallace




Ok, uh, you ain't that hard to go against U-God
Bitch, I keep squeezing til you dead or a retard
Walk past your block with my Glock and my iPod
Hoodie over, bandana, and flip your little Rover over
If it's a jungle, I'm a silverback, strip down it
Aston Martin through the hood, fiends wipe down it
Real hip hop, you looking for it, just found it
It's like punishment, the way a nigga stay grounded
Humble, but I rumble, bang you
Throw up the W, niggas'll Wu-Tang you
D-Block, I let it pop for the G-O-D
Mad bitches in the club, homey, you know me
I got paper, I urinate a couple G
Whitey's looking like, who he suppose to be?
Don Gorilla, a/k/a Donny G
Love crime, U-God, one more time, let's go





*helicopter sounds*


Shoot down planes, war games, in the black Range
With the snipe for aim cuz yo (it's militant)
Phillipine bitches in the black tint, commando
Showdown at the main event (it's militant)
We carry hand grenades, ooh-ahhs, and AK's
They troops, muddy boots, bulletproof Lex coupes (it's militant)
 Two G, Eloheem, submachine
 AT magazines, courage under fire (we killin shit)


Aiyyo fatigue, G.I.Joe's in armored tanks
American heroes covered with paint, black and gold like the Saints
Commandoes got rank, no blanks
Spill (?) Valentine, Afghan tinges at my team gun shank
I rack the 12 gauge, Shogun voices like sonic warfare
You die when you feel the bass, you dressed to kill
Let it play Six the Hard Way - we let off like 47 AK's
Okay, okay?


Yo, walls all red don, Killa-Arm recon
Our fleet bomb, all year long, surrender arms
Black Napoleon, petroleum, blitzkreig Mongolian
Missle whistle on the approach, sendin militiamen
Foxhole, fire in the hole, lick a shot slow
Y'all know, y'all analog niggas best take a stroll
Or wind up in critical - passed out, mobile army
Surgical hospital, last bout niggas, last bout niggas
Beretta on the trigger y'all - how could you figure?!
Marksman status




Evacuate the war, finger pop Glocks, fuck AK's
Make love to M-16's, when I step on the scene
With a fat mack and a fat stack, magazine
Camoflauge kinda swamp green
Cream for my face, cadets get laced from the neck up
Taste the blood from a leaf cut, you been struck
You weak fuck, Killarmy's the best
Affiliated with the best, so there's no contest
And when we launch these missles they be no one left
Terrorists, blow smoke niggas choke, hold ya breath
And went, niggas lay rounds on the block where's the ref?


Great scott, check my diabolical plots
I got a fetish for the fiendish, fuck the drama shit this be that hit
This murder in the first degree, and death be your penalty
When you try to mimic the army
You become a casualty of World War Three
We come through back to back, every man strapped, ready to handle that
Pre-cocked, ready to trigger that
Sauna raps, live on stage, at the Basker's, swordsman strike back
Lash out on attack, slash through ya back
Got a deal, a murder contract, to assassinate ya calmly on this track

 - 2X




Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home


Yeah yeah they want me locked down, fryin' in jail
Before you hear that I decided to tell, I'd rather die in a cell
I was framed like a wedding flick, 2 time felon
Still a predicate, doin' time, tell 'em that's a negative
Prejudice judge, bails be a mil' in cash
Scorin' money like the meter on the Yellow Cab
Give the witness an unexpected visit
Make his story change like walls blockin' his vision
Couldn't give a clear description, fearin' the repercussions
Like, "I was on the ground, I ain't see him bustin'"
Now the DA chasin' a plea, they hatin' I'm free
The case is mistaken identity


Whoever push me like Pusha T, I push back
I push a cap, before '93, I pushed crack
I'm hood, black, you know me well, what's good, scrap?
I'm smokin' rappers, you are a L, what's good Smack?
Hold up that's Goodz rap, pardon self
I just like good rap, but when I see Goodz I give his goods back
I rap for writers that pack strap to rhymers that backpack
To 25 to lifers that jack MAC
We movin' ratchets, no Kat Stacks, it's magic
The way we flip the package before the coppers can catch it
I'm past that chapter in life, let's live it lavish
When life take a piss in your bed, you flip the mattress
Before you try and get my head, get you some Pampers
Then take a long look at my ish and get your answers
Kick in my vicinity, I'm what rappers pretend to be
Charge 'em with a penalty, mistaken identity


Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy


Fresh off of work, he jumped out the van
Two suitcases, dangle from his hands
He opened up the door, headed up the stairs
Thought he heard a noise, but no one else was there
First sight he saw, struck him by surprise
Two shots was given, between his girl's eyes
Windows blown out, no prints on the door
All he seen was blood stains, smear the damn floor
911, ambulance showed up
Blood everywhere, paramedics throwin' up
Cops cuffed him up, hit him with the charge
But he was bangin' Mrs. Prixy at the Motor Lodge
He got his alibis, gonna use 'em all
He screwfaced the judge, he might take the fall
Someone set him up, a botched robbery
Mistaken identity, yeah it gotta be


17 years old, I'm headed back to the hole
I'm mistaken identity, every way was sold
I look like a hoodlum, I rock a lot of gold
They lockin' everybody up, ship your ass up the road
I ain't have a 9 on me, they was lyin' on me
Court day with my old bird, they was spyin' on me
Tried to set me up, plantin' coke in my pocket
The beast pat me up, they won't let me off


Na-n-n-n-n-nah it wasn't me
It could never been the G-O-D, not me
You terribly mistaken, son, I ain't the one
We could never look nothin' like, whether near or far sight
What resemblance does he strike? So my mic Fahrenheit
W for my a-alike, your DNA match tight
Even if they bite us, close but not quite
They still tryna get it right, mistaken identity


Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy



Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
Wanna go home..
Wanna go home..
Wanna go home..
Wanna go home..


Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy




The blade is much colder
Slaughter house lava shit boiling
Point molten rocky mountain
Cocky guitian string four star ninja claw to the jaw of course
You know the force the war I bring cut sting
Before I snub nose 'em cement toes them to death
The core scuff 'em some more
Then I hose 'em down some more
The braveheart slave
Whirlwind all in the all I
Might tip slip or stagger
Yo but I won't fall
Iron body be my hobby bending you bastards
Bio rhythem fly so now
Blowin' a gasket shell toe
Elbow slow gun ho pro
Methods of Mayhem mantis
First bury your face in the canvas quick
Then I vanish




I make 'em nod like ketamine
See him live might dive off the mezzanine
Ground drama, sound harder than crowd bonkers
I'm 'bout dollars, I touch down in your town, holla
INS, gladiator, call him Hustle Crowe
Son of pro, watch these lame niggas come and go
Blessed with the poison pen
Murder was the case so I guess it's them boys again
Through your duce high, salute I, be the general
The last one to run, I will take all ten of you
I'm feeling myself BK whiling the belt
Rocking my shit, eyes on the real wealth
Me and Goldie tell 'em it's easy money
Now shorty wanna fuck, that's sleazy, honey
Fame call us, money, it change all us
Get it how you live it or sing the same chorus
The game taught us, nothing in the bank for us
W claim walrus, yeah, Wu-Tang for life


Was raised on the island of the misfits
The children of the corn snatch your green with the biscuits
It's what you might call food for thought
And what's the killer season if you don't include the salt
This thought will start a feud and leave your whole mood distraught
Used to feel safe until they unscrewed your vault and
Took your common sense out your memory bank
Then dumped on you like missiles over enemy tanks
So homie, drive slow like you in front of five-O
Cause forks go in a road and your back is where the knives go
While the addicts hiding silver spoons
Being cut so deep, it's hard to heal the wounds
Those flashing don't blast, they still buffoons
Just blowing out hot air, they should fill balloons
Yo, I like them shorties that'll kill for goons
And start a hustle in an April to ccop wheels in June


I want leverage, ice cold beverage
Money I can't count, I blacked out standing on Mount Everest
Life lessons, the cover of essence
It's pure excellence, 5'10", write down my measurements
Politic the deficit, fingerprints, no evidence
Cocaine, caviar, hitting on receptionists
Hang with the specialists, gold medalist
Presidential cred, eating steaks that's tenderest
Got my bread, catch me in Megan Fox' bed
Cash crop, Gucci IPad, bag
Tall black top Nikes, with fat laces
Riches from rags, cashes and dime faces
Got promoted up, friends up in high places
Next move, my best move, chess move, the strategy
Closet full of guns, son, nothing but gadgetry
Get off that bullshit, that hip hop faggotry
I'm highbred nigga words defy gravity
Clothes never raggedy, oil paintings of me displayed up in gallery
Capture me, Wu Tang forever, immortality
High salary, blessing from a mother named Valery
And my two sons named after me
Racks from stacks, swiftly I'm browsing
First class ticket to the moon only cost fifty thousand
Niggas be doubting, it's understood, I'm running with goons
One of a kind, imported goods, killer the hood
Consume me, Lord, the last time I checked got 50 points on the board
Good Lord




Yeah, yo, there's a dozen ways to die, six million ways to do it
Let's go through it, my mind flow like fluid
Torture, chop your legs up, thrown off the boat
Guillotine, nigga, one chop to the throat
Suffocation, saran wrapping your face
Buried alive, throw a few nails in the case
Manslaughter, eight degrees of separation
Leave your body chopped up in a piece, that's mutilation


Six million ways to die, cyanide in your drink
Catch a Cuban necktie for your mink
Dahmer style, cut up and stuffed in the fridge
And maybe washed up ashore and found under the bridge
Hit him with the whip, drag him half a block
Machete or the sock full of padlocks
Chainsaw, switch your medication
Stomp a nigga out til he one with the pavement


Torture, he's gruely peaking at the meeting
Suspicions of him being a rat? Even worse than cheating
I'm cold reaking of ice picks, scratch and sticks and closed fists
Brassknuckle steel toe kicks
Cracked ribs, punctured lungs, hard breathing
He's gasping and wheezing for air, his breath he can't catch
He clinches the shirt on his chest
In a dying effort to reveal his last will before he was killed


First things first, I chop your head to your fingertips
Butcher knife your torso, chop up your ligaments
Make sure it's legitimate, conceal all my fingerprints
Chop, chop your body up quick then get rid of it
A hole in the desert, body bag, just polluted it
Your miss was a snitch too? Shotgun killed the bitch
Leave her in the wilderness, suffocated and scarred up
Your brother want more too, blow his fucking car up


Another homocide city, murder mystery efficiently
Delete your fucking history broke bone, missing teeth
Throw bones, it's slippery, brings on the triple beam
All topped and chopped up, my luck is a Mr. Clean
Clorax and vicious steam sterilized the whole scene
Photograph your death so I can spread it to your whole team
Won't leave a trace of evidence for the case
It's sinister to finish it, hit with the man with no face


Red wine and pink veal
Unknowing that this would be his last meal
Comfortable hes made to feel, six inch stiletto heel
Kept his refills filled
Titties like big ass, kept him still for the real deal
Hitman from Brooklyn, Tommy gun specialist
Our one accomplice, sipped Courvoisier at the bar
Then waited till she lit a cigar
Then sprayed
In shattered wine glass he lay, he never saw it coming


Yo, murder one, bullets went fast through the flesh
I cocked the sawed off shotty, put a hole in your chest
Blow your lungs out, I've seen you been smoking for years
You got no heart, I'll hunt you down like Cape Fear
Push your brains out the back of your head, blow off your hands
Leave your body in a dumpster, head in the trashcan
Cell catching scene look clean as a whistle
Ghost carved through your skin tissue til the bone grizzle




Yeah, yo, there's a dozen ways to die, six million ways to do it
Let's go through it, my mind flow like fluid
Torture, chop your legs up, thrown off the boat
Guillotine, nigga, one chop to the throat
Suffocation, saran wrapping your face
Buried alive, throw a few nails in the case
Manslaughter, eight degrees of separation
Leave your body chopped up into pieces, that's mutilation


Torture, he's gruely peaking at the meeting
Suspicions of him being a rat? Even worse than cheating
I'm cold reaking of ice picks, scratch and sticks and closed fists
Brassknuckle steel toe kicks
Cracked ribs, punctured lungs, hard breathing
He's gasping and wheezing for air, his breath he can't catch
He clinches the shirt on his chest
In a dying effort to reveal his last will before he was killed


First things first, I chop your head then your fingertips
Butcher knife your torso, chop up your ligaments
Make sure it's legitimate, conceal all my fingerprints
Chop shop your body up quick, then get rid of it
A hole in the desert, body bag, just filled the ditch
Your miss was a snitch too? Shotgun killed the bitch
Leave her in the wilderness, suffocated and scarred up
Your brother want more too, blow his fucking car up


Another homocide city, murder mystery efficiently
Delete your fucking history, broke bones, missing teeth
Blow bones to smithereens, brings on the triple beam
All topped and chopped up, mop buckets and Mr. Clean
Clorax and vicious steam sterilized the whole scene
Photograph your death so I can spread it to your whole team
But won't leave a trace of evidence for the case
It's sinister to finish it, hit with the man with no face


Six million ways to die, cyanide in your drink
Catch a Cuban necktie for your mink
Dahmer style, cut up and stuffed in the fridge
And maybe washed up ashore and found under the bridge
Hit him with the whip, drag him half a block
Machete or the sock full of padlocks
Chainsaw, switch your medication
Stomp a nigga out till he one with the pavement


Red wine and pink veal
Unknowingly that this would be his last meal
Comfortable hes made to feel
Six inch stiletto heel, kept his refills filled
Titties like big ass, kept him still for the real deal
Hitman from Brooklyn, Tommy gun specialist
Our one accomplice, sipped Courvoisier at the bar
Then waited till she lit a cigar, then sprayed
In shattered wine glass he laid, he never saw it coming


Yo, murder one, bullets went fast through the flesh
I cocked the sawed off shotty, put a hole in your chest
Blow your lungs out, I've seen you been smoking for years
You got no heart, I'll hunt you down like Cape Fear
Push your brains out the back of your hat, blow off your hands
Leave your body in a dumpster, head in the trash can
Cell catching scene look clean as a whistle
Ghost carved through your skin tissue, till the bone grizzle



Born with the struggle, used to hustle for crumbs
Fillin blunts in the building front, thuggin for ones
Full-clips fly, nicks, dimes, suckin the pump
Whole cliques fly, whips, dimes, nothing to son
City boy on the corner, I was so involved
So the drama I embraced, it would open arms
Tryna shake the pain, hoping I could break the chains
Everyday the same - who am I to make it change?
Real, my niggas risk it all just to play the game
And the young'uns going through it trying to play the same
Through the rain, through the fire, handcuffed by desire
Cynthia's son, forgive me for all the sins that I've done


My life, my pain lasts forever
Nothing in these streets makes it better
My life, my pain lasts forever
Nothing in these streets makes it better
So I live on..

Got a lot on my mind
As my life's shrinking and I'm caught in the times
It's a quarter to nine and I'm grabbing my nine
I had dreams, I just wanted to rhyme
Climb my ways out this wack-ass ghetto
I signed my name on the line with the Devil
Still in my prime ? to settle
Pots on the stove, old grandma's kettle
Late for my job - "he thinks he's a star!"
She hates her husband, he says I'm a slob
Mixed feelings, she ain't getting involved
Battle of the sexes, the planet off its axis
The IRS, god damn I owe these taxes!
The true verse, but I can take it
It's a long time coming, but I can make it
No mistaking, the CREAM is back..


My life, my pain lasts forever
Nothing in these streets makes it better
My life, my pain lasts forever
Nothing in these streets makes it better
So I live on..

I got my niggas, true niggas, real niggas
Stop the wheel, really?
You only feel me if you walk the same road
Talk the same codes
Still dwelling in the Hell and find the time to make a home
The few who escape tryna find a safer zone
I ain't waiting for Obama, never doubted him
I'm proud of him. He real, spend a couple million on the housing and
Seeing is believing, my vision is blurred
Cause I ain't seen nothing, I heard
Really ain't nothing but words, divine my mind
I'm still stuck to the curb
Sky high, but it wasn't the shurm
Really nothing but herbs - I risk it all for the cause
Even if it's war with the law
I can't/won't/don't stop, I ain't got an off switch
Dying trying to live it, just to get a small part of it
My squad is sick type that you don't want problems with
Rolling like 70 Mack trucks - what's stopping it?




I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Five score years ago, a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today


Look, homicide is illegal, death is a penalty
Never let go when you've got ahold of your enemy
Eagle claw cobra clutch by any means necessary
Ill never let it go, see my shadow ninja mic flow
I throw a great archer dart arrow to your temple
Almighty bow of Ulysseus the indigenous
Plan of the Wu-Tang Clan became a world brand
We never let it go, we talk a half a mil a show


Never let go of your mind
Its a terrible thing to waste
To lose, but its very hard to find
Being that ignorance is lethal
We must touch hearts, tune souls, harmonize the people
Never let go of your plan, execute
So when you shoot, inspire everyone on the land
Never lose knowledge of yourself
For it may become risk to your health
And great loss of wealth


Never let go of your cream, never let go of your dream
Players retire, but they never let go of the team
If you a rider then you never let go of that thing
Pull up your mans like you better let go of that bling
This lifes crazy, too many life sentences, maybe
Fatherless babies on the block but they father 380
Thats just the hood lately, never let go
Im what the hood made me
Momma told me to find a good lady


Never let go of staring at the death
Like yo, that's your best blow
I still hold on like En Vogue
The cold go to war with the heat
Eyes wide, never falling asleep
All the talking is cheap
Call'em, ultimate warrior, W.W.F
I come up victorious, struggle is nothing to Deck
Set it straight for the seeds, to see a better new
Take the real life by the rings and I aint letting go
I aint letting go


No matter what the odds be
No matter how hard we
You never let go


Never let go of the fight, never let go of the mic
My honesty, my values, my loyalty, my pride
And memory of those who have passed to the other side
Never letting go, Im never letting go of my beliefs
My faith, convictions, real
Both hands holding on, never let go the wheel
We hood legends, misunderstood
These lessons, learned
Growing up for manhood
Keep focus on the prize what you better do
A little taste of heaven, sunshine is where we headed to
States whats ahead of you, always on the schedule
Smoke the gold leaf down to the residue
Letting go, is something that I never do
Those who let go, live life regrettable
Never let go of your hope or your rope
Eyes on the prize, never let go of the scope
When Im in jail, never let go of the soap
Hold on, boy, never let go


Never let go, the all-eye-seeing, the supreme
Never let go the love of your seeds, or your queen
Never let go your heart, or the place you started
The feeling that I had, Wu-Tang had just charted
The old earth departed, I give thanks to the martyrs
I never let go the love I have for thy father
Never let go the glow
The more I know the more that it shows
I wont let go, even if I decompose
Your seed will carry it on, we need to carry it on
Pass the baton, life is just the marathon
And ain't' playing to win it, its an epidemic
Never let go, thats what the god recommended




And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. Who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. For many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom




Classic, classic, classic, classic (yo)
Classic, classic, classic (yo, yo)


I got book rhymes, Crook lines, Built like tankers
Look Ma they took mines hook line and sinker
Big time thinker nailed in a pine box
Watching like a hawk kid, Seats in the sky box
Cut you with a dry ox, Slapped with a bank roll
Stank hoes on salary loving my lingo
Get money, Make moves, Burn more calorie
Bruise your anatomy, My atom is hard
Slam you on the granite dammit, Rap bandits at large
Pin metals on my chest, Stir up the hornet's nest
Burn holes in your neck, Control your flesh
Fat back wheels, Crack kills children
Every time the mack spits in the back of the building
Splash with a feeling, You need a healing
Hot shots of sake, son, you can't stop me
You can't drop me son or cock block me
I'm powder puff so ruff, slot time, Dough rush
Hit my enemies in your guts, Cold crush
Rib cage blow up, Everything's hurricane
Red beams tear your frame, My dick game's never lame
Slang right, Daylight, Hot grease and egg whites
Hog mics all night, Fisticuff dog fights
With Dillinger's, Motorized mouth out the cylinder
War tone, Guerrilla hormone, Vast in the ominence
Dance with the Ramadan, Throw y'all armor on
Gift wrap your karma strong, Shots out in Lebanon
LeBron James, Golden Arms, Large Professor, Niggas cocaine niggas


Classic, classic, classic, classic
Classic, classic, classic, classic
Classic, classic, classic



*police radio* (humming)

(U-God)

Night falling, red dawn, without warning or beef
Late night city life, in the dark Manhattan fog, creep
Wit' cats and dogs become meat
All that is sacred
My body lay naked
Aching for some weeks, maybe it was a hostage taken
Some money making Jamaican
High for thuggery disgrace on did him ugly, kicked his bloody face in
Maybe he was mistaken for some great man
In a dirty place he lay in a gray basement
Shaking his scabs, crack bag, stabbed up four times, strong!
With a long rusty Jason
Dumped the smoldering corpse in a dumpster truck of garbage
In this mad man hell he laid in
Logical was hatred
Some replacement killer came through, left small traces
Engraved his chest
Left him for death
Left him on his last breath
Crawling, just to make a statement (hu hu huh)
In this matrix
Subconsciously gazing the soft shell of a man
Somehow found, amazing!
By the department of sanitation
Under city lights to the hospital
Hit him with the chest rockers, shockers
Pop him open just to keep his heart racing (Clear)

(Chorus)
Will he make it?
Will he survive?
Terror in his eyes
Night the city cries
Payback is crime
He damn near died
Banished my wounds not mine
The city cries, drama ride
Guns out the window, slide
Before me now the city cries

(U-God)

Unconscious for months (beep beep)
Deep in coma shock
When you awoke, it was hope
Dry throat
Choking off tools, being fed ice cubes
Pain in you head
Change of the bed
Doped up and soaking while police on top
Doctors monitor your heart (heart beating)
Sergeant Bilko came in with some zombie ass cops
What we have here the chief embraces
In his hands he pulls out two briefcases
A picture popped up on computer
One woman, one man, sharpshooter
He asked you do you remember these two faces?
'Mind you you're blind, completely hung out to dry, victimized
Violated as if you was raped
What the hell
You escape well
Police investigated the scene
Scrape the crime scene
Down to the bone panel
While you lay frail in the enamel
Under you nails in the scuffle
You scratched some DNA samples that match
The blood on your clothes are not yours, it was his
Right before you blacked out, took that blow
In September, you can't remember
You ripped his nose ring
Right out his nose
Before he took it four times in the ribs
But somehow he lived
]From the little bit of blood you grabbed
His skin type, you ran it back to forensic labs
Your finger prints popped up
This is where it begins
Your street name was Henry the Saint
Staten Island's where your crib was at
Park Hill project was your outlet
You was a target
Or organized outfit
Not by the mafia, this where it get chills
Your wife hired some hitman to kill you for your ten million dollar will
Money fund drill
Booby trapped perhaps
Left his food for the rats
Now...

(Chorus)
Will you make it?
Will you survive?
Terror in your eyes
Night the city cries
Payback is crime
You damn near died
Bandaged by wounds not mine
The city cries, drama ride
Guns out the window slide
Before me now the city cries

(U-God)

One cop's weakness
Was heroic, he exposed pieces
Leaked out information
On surveillance where his wife was staying
Police tracked her down
Blood hound on the east side of town
In some skyscraper
They had video tapes of her
And some porn star fling, her and the next door neighbor
And the killer with the nose ring
But the police didn't have a case
'Cause the victim couldn't remember a thing
Not even a face
He had to clear his name
He bit off more than he could chew
His absent minded flash backs grew
And grew to hate
He had to escape
To ICU
On the second day he came through
He concocted the impossible
The psych' slipped out the cuffs
Somehow killed to armed guards (bang, bang)
Grabbed their guns
Before he fled the hospital, slivers into the night
If police hunting was right
He's seeking for justice
Off point bulletin
On a black male Jamaican
Meanwhile a dark lookable crook
Is in a alleyway for retaliation
A limo pulled across the street from a gas station
He saw his wife
And the nigga that knifed him
He wanted to mash him
He was real patient
A devilish growl sensation
And the rain grew to a foul meditation (sound of rain)
Of betrayal, murder revenge
Bitch that set you up will get hers in the end
In the hall of the lobby floor
Security on post
Got gun butted three times in the head with the old dusty toast
Now he slipped past the video cameras undetected
To the 25th floor
Apartment 504
When he rang the bell (ding dong) sweet voice said
She cracked it open, her reply I thought you was dead
In a matter of seconds and inches
The door was hanging off the hinges (crash)
Her eyes met the metal
She screamed Oh my God
Out the back room the killer with the nose ring
Smashed the nigga in the head with a porcelain vase
Shots ricochet like lightning roads
Put the bimbo in arms
The drapes caught on fire, with no alarm
They crashed out the window, but they somehow held on
Dangling from a hundred stories high
Don't doubt him
Will he make it?
Continued next album

(Chorus)
Will he make it?
Will he survive?
Terror in his eyes
Night the city cries
Payback is crime
He damn near died
Bandaged by wounds not mine
The city cries, drama ride
Guns out the window slide...

Golden Arm is as good as his reputation says
With his bare hands he stood all of us off
And if he had weapons...

Golden Arm never uses weapons
Says he doesn't need them
He says using his bare arms is the best
And he's probably right
Nobody's beaten him yet
Just using his arms he beat us all then
We had no chance
He had us cold



*harpsichord solo*


THERE'S NO sinning, bears getting dressed to kill
Laughing down the sun like a jackal will
With his eyes ablaze and his lips apart
He's gonna fill his cup with the love in your heart
And drink it up till the morning starts
Circulate the red light this is get the girls and get the sis'
Pinch him up and give em bliss
Kissin fears with all his might forever


Standed on the verge of the edge of the ledge
Waitin for me to fall, then I got a call
It said, "WAIT HOLD UP HOMEY, YOU MUST BE TRIPPIN
YOU CAN'T BE PUTTIN THAT STRIPPIN AND WHIPPIN
UP IN YOUR PIMPIN, YOU BETTER STAND TALL
FOOL YOU WAS BORN TO BALL
TOOK A LITTLE FALL AND NOW YOU WANNA END IT ALL
YOU BEEN CHASIN DREAMS LIKE A HOUND DOG ON THE HUNT
Take your place in the front wit yo' hands on the blunt
And it's right in your grasp man, I know they laughin
BUT YOU'LL BE LAUGHIN LATER CUZ TIMES IS GON' GET GREATER!"


That's when you least expect it
You understand there is no exit


Aiyyo rock that *shit*, slamdance to this
Move the *fuck* back when you see us in the mosh pit
Smash something when my heavy metal raps thump in
Crack more heads open than Beck's, you and your mans floated
Tales From The Crypt, Rocky Horror couldn't Picture it
Spine-tingling, give you goose bumps singin it
*Bitch-ass niggas* scared to party wit The Infamous
We jumpin over the bar snatchin mad liquors


Out of the darkness, spark this total chaos
Mark to scheme the hardest, nothing can save us
All that is sacred, dearly departed
Braveheart slave brave contains something courageous
Salute shining armor, persona rip stages
Loud as Nirvana, beneath the golden ages
The road rash explode, little rigor that devour
Don't cry for me, I'm bout drunk off the power

Chorus  2x
Who's gonna cry for ya
Who's gonna cry over you


Now if you think my Infamous Mobb remains untamed
And we out for the cash while you out for the fame
Lay back, count on my stack down to Cognac
Writin my raps, here hold that, it's bound to go plat
When my bang hits, relentless, whatever I spit
Like a fresh pair of kicks outta the box, ready to rock
You know the drilly stay collaboratin wit my committee
Then it's on the L-I-E to QB city


Yo yo
We storm the sound clash, but none heard the sound of the blast
Send the mass outta control, the system found smash
There's blood on the dance floor, they still chant "More!"
The nitty gritty, New York inner city
Fifty caliber thoughts force the world to bang wit me
Bound to hit hard like twenty gods benchin in the yard
Men at large take charge, out to make ours and take ours
We fought against all odds
Party crasher, verbal assault, quick to blast ya
Ya stunned momentarily, dropped seconds after

Chorus 2x

*guitar solo*

Chorus to end



 x4
One of these days and you won't be long


I'm from the home where the buffalo roam
And niggas don't give a flyin' fuck
Talk with signs up, walk with the iron tucked
Leave your eyes wide shut
Money bag's on the table, gots to get my cut
Rebel I city slicker, pick up a pretty sister
Dig her out on the table, bent off the Rmy liquor
Head splitter, deliver so cold I send shivers
From many figures, battle the world or any nigga
I'm uptown saturday night like Bill Cos'
Got weed in the jars with vanilla cigars
On the strip, eyeballin' the chicks, all in the mix
Gassed off of my shit, vibratin' the whip

 x2


Yo I'm sicker than the V12 X5
With cracks in the Rolly jumper all we do is Drink fuckin' Drive
Real niggas raise up, Mommy get your feet off the table
The cable luck bare, my man got me one on his leckle
It's nothin' for me to get up with you, guts with you
Blow off them matches and sit up with you
Aiyo the streets, what is gettin' more crazy?
Stressin' me nothin', investin' the leathers, we all into things blazin'
Slingin' coke is just a normal habit, rappers we wear
Straddlers with cannons and hatchets gettin' cheers
Yatzis are fresh off the block, block squeezin', it's real
If we get real, put pop, poppin' at your blocks equal
Take these niggas and throw 'em in lakes, it's business
Rake these niggas on the mic, display your ninjas
Nines crowns verses your nine towns
Run up with nine 9's, brown down, get to lyin' you down

 x2


I come from the slums, I ain't no dummy
My testiment talk, represent money
This Verbal Intercourse, fueled by exhaust
The bread winner, head spinner, coldest with the force
No remorse, endorse the rap artist
So flamboyant cos I pimp slap the hardest
Ever since the triumph we've been missin' them soldiers
We came tonight, boy the mission is cobra, full exploder
Bulldose through the rubbish, I'm in too deep boy
I just gotta love this, they call we too sweet
One of the nine brothers, I'm so unique
Every line that smother, the situation's grim
It's bloody sin cos every time I want out they pull me back in
I see my reflection in the chrome mac 10
Ask the passer who's faster with the pen
Then pull it, nine hollows, amorettos
That's how I like it, sweat on my wine bottles
The automobiles with them shiny assed hubs
The endo pull, with the bathtub club, my angel's in the mud
Veteran smile, that's gangsta shit, that American style
Dig it, prick or prey
I'm quick to slay with the rectifier shit, caught by the ricochet nigga

"I got to know"

 x2

"I got to know"




Let me bug out, let me bug out for a second (fucka!)
That's why... (oh! Muthafuckas!)
Mmm-mmm-mmm, it's gangsta, nigga
It's potent (Uh, Six Mill) East coastin', try to hide..


All the pain inside
I had to face it that one day I'm gonna die
That's why I try to keep my head up towards the sky
Sit back and watch, let me take you on a ride
Uh, natural high..


Yo, yo, make it rain again, spit flame again
Now, watch how I'm aimin' 'em, my bare hands is stranglin'
Time to bang again, camera shots anglin'
That's right I got your head piece danglin'
Mic's is tanglin', toast champagne again
Coast to coast now, join the campaign again
I fuck more women than Wilt Chamberlain
It's, U-God, yeah he Back in the Game again
I'm titanium, mixed with uranium
Crack craniums, no tamin' him
Live at palladium (yeah), jam packed stadium (yeah)
Many men, you're afraid of him
Once they weighed him in, he flushed money down the drain again
Touched vein again, rocks I'm slangin' 'em
Cops can't finger him, SWAT can't bring him in
New millennium, we came to win




I move in silence, and let guns go to my enemies
Bud smoke and Hennessy, the remedy and toke is violent
Much slugs longer than Mini Me
Cross me, I lay down every one in your vicinity
Keep a fifty cali' or line me in the Akademiks jeans
If I catch a homi', somebody probably run and snitched on me
Rats, runnin' round talkin' this and that
Some white chicks I spit til your wigs sit back
I grind these cracks, cuz I need cash
G stacks, I lay my game down flat like a Chinese ass
You heard me? Bitches wanna observe me, learn me
My mission is gettin' Ritz like Jersey, chips for attorney's
Commissary for niggas that's in the pen thirsty
A big truck, your trick hypnotize by the twirlies
It's Ice, from Shaolin to Crenshaw, dirty
Luv Allah, dump a clip off, at the BX, early




Why ... the angels came down and pushed the devil in the dirt
Jerked the memory exist on the iron-on T-shirt
Pythons squeeze til your face turns purple
It's a race to murder you and I'm jumpin' the gun
Dump and run, the long nose cuttin' the soldier's tongue
Your nervous from the burners I'm squeezin'
Without a learner's permit, to carry
The calico stays concealed, if revealead
I must spray this clip through your windshield, it's rea
My whole team reigns supreme, the infrared tech beams
On my next swing, the heavy chain
Deadly but steady aim, I cry "tears of the sun"
That'll burn the iron hot, as I'm piercin' through your lungs
It's strung by my drug dealer's doses
Ferocious slang that'll bang up your brains in roller coasters
Posters in the background ready to clap rounds
And empty up whole magazines up to the last round

Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone


We don't hunt deer
Vegetarian dishes from the concierge
Presidential suites, presidential treats
Brazilian models, oilin' up my feet
10 days a month, my girl pays for lunch
3 days a week, we work out at Crunch
Time after time, line after line
Our stock increases, rhyme after rhyme
In the valley, of San Fernando
Found Q-Tip's wallet in El Segundo
Prolly been spotted on Telemundo
With more wild cards than a box of Uno
That spin like propeller, my dog like Old Yeller
Holler at the moon, my goons at Coachella


Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone


I got my hands in the pot, 500 grand in the yacht
I'm the dope man with plans to expand on every block
Wu-brand, legendary hands, hard as penitentiary rock
Now put that to your temple, the Wu symbol's 'bout to drop
Insert the beam on my Glock, got that lean in my bottle
What that mean? High self esteem, straight cream on the top
Ridin' chops similar to UFC kickbox, kick rocks
Dirty trucker pit stops, shit, grams in a Ziploc
Watch how the pitbull lock his jaws, then lock your doors
Feds watch the boards, hip hop spills out my pores
I be raw, for fourscore plus 7 more
The Clan rock the tours, we be them reservoir dogs


Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier


Guaranteed I bang hard
I plan to leave the game large, no brainwash
The devil himself could not persuade God, my blade's sharp
Circle my square, I dare you Braveheart
Before I leave your head in your hands, what's your name, huh?
My lines get in your cells like 7 Ls
Any problem, I address you like I'm sendin' you mail
Let me do well, they'd rather see me dead or in jail
But let it be my life story if they ever do tell
Know I died for what I live
An intimate connection for that infinite reflection
That's my wife and my kids, there's a price on my lid
So now my stock's high and shots fired
My niggas who was tight with the kid
I'm hot as Hell's Kitchen with the oven on
Deck bomb, teflon the rappers nothin' to a don
If I'm frontin' then respond
If not, throw up your arms, it's the Killer Bee swarm
And your set, the fuck is y'all?


You entering the 36, mastering the 18
Sliding across chamber sixth, hands down that'll crush bricks
Backs thatll break bats, this is what y'all wanted back
Classic Wu RZA track with Mathematic actual facts
That weigh heavy, the universal striking attack
Dance the drunken medley, long axe blade, machete
The shadow stepping ninja


Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier

De la joie, des drames, du bounce Bams, casse, j'chasse
Les fronties en terre, s'il te faut faire les mers hamster
Je te joigne toutes les chiasses
Je guis la disgrace, outre passe le bien souvent mes droits
Par devoir c'est mon choix, je zappe
Zzzzzzz!, je pique!, zzzzzzzzz!
S'il le faut t'allumes le clep
Je pilotes jusqu'la jeep de Fly (Ouuuuuu!)
Survoles tous les sttypes (Ouuuu!), mes yeux des tescopes

You die and scream, I'm the cherry on top
Scary are cops 'cause I carry the glock
Look up at my eye boy, dare my to pop
Hand me my Scotch, Scotch on the rocks
100,000 rocks for my ghetto blocks
Killin' flo' level the spillin' won't stop
Buildin' more treble 'til I fill in my slot
I want my props, I need the shit
In the spotlight 'cause I'm lethal kid
Cockblockin' niggaz make the needle skip
Knock out the biggest when you see me flip
All on the corner, Desert Eagle grip
Get the benchwarmers and you see who flip
Yes the white star with the see-thru chipped
Sunday night permorfance when you see who hits
Bless my endurance, he who gets
Lambor' dick ride, don't ever ever quit
You say tomato I say to-motto
You say potato I say po-tawto
You say today and I say tomorrow
Some say it's mixed and I saw Milano

Freeze, please, grille...

Why?!?! 




Once again...
Through the storms


I gotta stay strong take deep breaths, hold on long
Bring the harm with no regrets
On my chest, let me knowledge be born on levels, wild
Devil copters mark my every step
When the riots form, my woman keeps me warm
From Fort Green I sing the song mean
Bring the calm overseas, glide high in the skies
Sky dive... far... far as the eye could see
In the midst of acapell', I ball my fist up
Unravel, travellin to the cells of Gotti
I shot up a shell, will he drop? Will he flop?
Will he go pop a cell? Is his mind frail?
The worst is groove frantic, he expand the planet
Plan harder, your Godfather's plans failed
I air mail the senseless scar, two snub noses
Niggas love those expensive cars
Is it him and those twenty inch rims, splittin the tar?
An amazon woman from the stripbar
God, it varies, Halley Berry, stars eatin hard cherries
This world is bizarre, not bein far from Mars
Galaxy hoppin, non-stoppin the sun rays
Stay and paid for real, 'til I'm old and grey
Pretty legs, of course, soft as clay
Degrees, hot breeze in your hair all day, all day
Engaged a lot, rockin hot and cold chains
Is my brain vain? Flames, still dock the missles
Let off one, stay in your lane
Everybody got issues, I'm drunk off the rum
Numb, one case got thrown out in dismissal
Everybody got pistols, but will the referee blow the whistle
Before I lock on your ass, bone gristle?
These streets is crystal, crystal, crystal


Pleasure and pain, some took lead to the brain
Got rich and couldn't live for the end of the game
Government train, breakin off the slavery chain
From a weddin to a funeral, it's pleasure and pain
Guns, gangs cock back, ready to aim
Colin Fergusons, ridin on the back of the train
Televisions and this cocaine, got us insane
We got to war, if we all got a burner, then flame
Baby showers, same day as nuclear showers
Prophecy's harsh, world will be destroyed in an hour
Shots fired in the night, from the heart of the coward
Stop the growth of the young flowers from going to Howard
Brooklyn Babe Ruth, raised in fatigues and boots
Blue-printin who we hittin, and we need to shoot
No description, all though it was dark, an Egyptain
And didn't have no love, but a grudge against Clinton


Representin... how much gold can one man claim?
Over horizon, recognize him, it's candy rain
Flusty, lookin out of dusty old window pane
With nothin to lose, but everythin to gain
So far to go, much more is unclaimed
No delay, when we spray, we Play IV Keeps in the Jeeps
Stumpin somethin gritty, it's gun nitty in the city
That never sleeps, street sweepin
Is senseless, intense, fenced in, fleein
A long road ahead, I'm still believin in my freedom
On the darkest day, I'd say your darkest hour
I came to realize, the sin is most inner-most power
So enchanted, cry inside, fryin and dancin
At God speed, damn it, fear is planted
Severe nature of man, there's still no cure
Seduce me, reduce me to ashes, caught in the law
Atoms scatter, brain lashes, to the core question
Still no answers, moves of the phantom, handsome
Midnight silence surround us, eye in the sky
Everything is a lesson, RZA I love the God for all of your blessings
I'm reppin, grateful 'til I'm dead, hateful heads, we under Allah's
Protection
Essence of life, one second, after the blastin
I wonder, is Heaven truly everlastin?
I'm askin, I said it to four lost relatives missin, in action
Communication breakdown, it's all the same
Havin a nervous breakdown, draw you insane
It's just pleasure and pain, pleasure and pain
Another man's loss, another man's gain
Stay in the game, pleasure and pain
We treasure the fame, pleasure and pain
Pleasure and pain, pleasure and pain, pain, pain, pain




Forgive me..
For all that shit I did in my past..
You know what I'm sayin'...


Is anyone out there? Does anyone care?
This is my testament, my bedtime prayer
I resent my sins, oh Lord, listen clear
I can feel it in the heat of the night, and in the air
Lord, give me your ear, I want you, to understand
Please forgive me, I'm a righteous man
Tryin' to do the best I can, just to feed my fam
I might die, in these streets, by some jealous hands
Now I can it's some scam, from the root to the fruit
Cuz when they see me in the streets, grimey's guns salute
Me, it's the moment of truth, I got mud on my boots
Plus the sounds of the sirens, cops in hot pursuit
Pray for me..


As I lay thee down to sleep
I pray the Lord, the soul to keep
If I die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, the soul to take


All this pressure, building up in the pot
When the schemes released, I'm bout to blow my top
I'm the cream of the crop, when machine guns pop
I seen the death angel come when I see son drop
I cried, tattoo tear drops, cuz inside it hurt
I saw his life flash before him, as he lied in the dirt
And searched for heaven on earth, in his debts, sold in land
I poisoned my own community, with kilos and grams
And people don't take a stand, politics tempers flare
They build, prisons 'stead of parks, children end up in there
It's the welfare, the precinct, the daycare's, indecent
The churches, the priest, inside the belly of the beast
It's, diseases, crack babies, people actin' crazy
Oh Lord, can you save me? If not, snatch up my baby
Ohhh..






Caller: "So whassup, man?"
DJ: "Coolin', man."
C: "Chillin' chilin'? Yo, you know I had to call, you why right?"
DJ: "Why?"
C: "Because, you, I never ever call and ask you to play somethin', right?"
DJ: "Yeah."
C: "You know what I wanna hear, right?"
DJ: "Whatchu wanna hear?"
C: "I wanna hear that Wu-Tang joint."
DJ: "Wu-Tang again?"
C: "Ah yeah, again and again."


I smoke on the mic like "Smokin' Joe" Frazier
The hell-raiser, raisin' hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider-Man
So uhh, tick tock and keep tickin'
While I get you flippin' off the shit that I'm kickin'
The Lone Ranger, code red: Danger
Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart
The vandal too hot to handle
You battle, you're sayin' goodbye like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspectah Deck's on the set
The Rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal


The way I make the crowd go wild
Sit back, relax, won't smile
Rae got it goin' on, pal
Call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat
Blow up your project, then take all your assets
'Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, go flip on the next man
'Cause I grab the clip and
Hit you with 16 shots and more, I got
Goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh


It's the Method Man, for short Mr. Mef
Movin' on your left, UH!
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break, fool, cock me back
Small change, they puttin' shame in the game
I take aim and blow the nigga out the frame
And like Fame my style will live forever
Niggas crossin' over, but they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a "Suuu"?
Nuff respect due to the 1-6-oooh
I mean ohhh, yo, check out the flow
Like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off, because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt make me *cough*


Ooh, what, grab my nut, get screwed
Oww, here comes my Shaolin style
True B-A-ba-B-Y-U
To my crew with a "Suuuuuuu"


C'mon, baby baby, c'mon, baby baby
C'mon, baby baby, c'mon


Yo, you best protect ya neck


First things first, man, you're fuckin' with the worst
I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a fuckin' nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zu
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down, that shit is packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin'
Ason Unique rollin' with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
Bite my style, I'll bite your motherfuckin' ass


For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
There's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats; if Rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stompin' grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin' star
'Cause who I are is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar
Point-blank as I kick the square biz
There it is, you're fuckin' with pros, and there it goes


Yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that
It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feelin' mad hostile, wearin' Aropostale
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy robe, then attack the globe
With the buck-us style, the ruckus
Ten times ten men committin' mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums
(He'll be) comin' around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one down
Ju-Jugger-Genius, take us the fuck outta here


The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap
That's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact, bring out the girls, and let's have a mud fight!


You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck




Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to welcome to you
All the way from the slums of Shaolin
Special uninvited guests
Came in through the back door
Ladies and gentlemen, it's them!


Dance with the mantis, note the slim chances
Chant this anthem, swing like Pete Sampras
Taking it straight to Big Man On Campus
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Scandalous, made the metro panic
Cause static with or without the automatic
And while I'm at it, yo, you got cash, pass it
It's drastic, gotta send half to Dirty Bastard


Waves is spinning, blades is spinning
Slay em in the eighth inning
Stay truck, god stay playing linen
Kill rap, observe the uptowns, ho, feel that
Mink jeans on, seen where the real at
2000 Zitos, moving with a ill ego
For real, for real, ill lines, ill people
Yo, bring it back, 9 more civilians
Pollying deals, monopoly and bills, y'all niggas lying
Caught 300, lab look royal wit a mean stomach
Go broke, all seen, done it
Words from the heavy set, if I don't eat, then we already met
Fly ass bro, liver than coke


Now what Clan you know with lines this ill?
Bust shots at Big Ben like we got time to kill
Niggas can't gel or I'm just too high to tell
Put on my gasoline boots and walk through Hell
With 9 generals, 9 ninjas in your video
9 milli blow, semi-auto with no serial
Man metaphysical, I speak for criminals
Who don't pay they bills on time and fuck with digital
Never seen, smoke a bag of evergreen
My sword got a Jones, more heads for the severing
Johnny in the dungeon, taking all bets, throw ya ones in
Scared money don't make money, throw ya guns in


That's word to Damo, San Juan, Puerto Rico
Blowin hydro on a beach wit Tamiko
My gun bullet hollow for you to swallow
Blowin' the nozzle, hear it whistle
One in the head, this is code red, man for dead
X amount of lead spray from the barrel
Heat clear the street like Connor O'Carroll
Fully equipped, rifles, banana clip shit
To make my niggas from East New York flip


Yo, you may catch me in a pair of Polo Skipperys, matching cap
Razor blades in my gums (BOBBY!)
You may catch me in yellow Havana Joe's goose jumper
And my phaser off stun (BOBBY!)
Y'all might just catch me in the park playin' chess, studyin' math
Signin 7 and a sun (BOBBY!)
But you won't catch me without the ratchet, in the joint
Smoked out, dead broke or off point (BOBBY!)


Wallo's comfortable, chocolate frosting
Your socks hangin' out, yours is talkin'
Rock so steadily, son, I'm still crazy
Sport my old Force MD furs from the 80's
Nat Turners wit burners, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Taught y'all niggas how to rap, reimburse me
Rothsdale's, ruby red sales, Bloomingdale's, blocks
Ox tails chopped up in Caribbean spots
I'm nice, maxed out, creepin' wit the ax out
Murder these bikini bitches, switchin with they backs out


Niggas wanna pop shit, I pop clips
Bitch, I'll put my dick on ya lips
Alabama split, hammer slay quick
That David Banner gamma ray shit
Shells in the mouth, jailhouse snitch
My powder voice, Snow White sniff
Verbal killas, gorilla grip
God body shit, puff Marley spliffs


You might see me in a 6, that's not my style
You might see me wit a bitch, that's not my child
I be in the benzo, keep a low profile
Dead serious, take flicks and don't smile
Tryin' to get money, y'all cats is wild
I pose for the clothes, make a song like wild
I'm a chip off the board game, got sword game
Live life to the fullest, still want more fame
Darts on layaway, beats on standby
Outfits pressed up, ready for airtime


Run on the track like Jesse Owens
Broke the record flowin', without any knowin'
That my wordplay run the 400 meter relay
It's on once I grab the baton from the DJ
A athlete wit his iron cleat in the ground
Wireless nigga who sprint off the gun sound
The best time yet still 7.0
Swift flow made the cameramen clothes blow




I'm tellin' you, tellin' you, tellin' you
Ain't ready, Mark, Mark, they ain't ready, man
They ain't ready, they ain't ready, they ain't ready for me
They ain't ready for me, they ain't ready for me right now, nigga
I'm here...  When you thought it was safe
Ahh... ooh... give it to me, give it to me
Uh... yeah... now give it to me, give it to me
Pump... now bump bump... now bump..
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, now bump


Baby, when you put it on me (on me)
Do you thing relentlessly ('lessly)
Don't you wanna scream my name?  again
I just wanna scream your name (your name)
Give you lovin' that's insane 
Baby, won't you make me scream  again


Yo, yo, yo... now your's truly, same ol' g
Ya'll gon' see, you can't hold me
Feel my energy, my soul so free
For a half a century, I've been low key
Who is he? They call him, U-G-O-D
Real grizzly, busy as a bee
Feel it in the air, over the sea
Don't be mad cuz your ho chose me
Hazel eyes, no goatee, hold heat, rock you to sleep
Known in the streets for my platinum teeth
Cuz when I pop something, I go in deep, no bump




Now that's right, nigga, I got those skills
Nerves of steel, sex appeal
Hand skills, like windmills
Mind bender, every time I send chills
Dressed to kill, throw 'em in the trance
Make 'em dance like ants in they pants
Check out my, battle stance, comin' down
Avalanche, war's closing and you got no chance
Hard, rock, abs, move like a snake
All that ass, make the waterbed break
Skin like a god and for heaven's sake
Why you wanna make a nigga scream your name? Spark..


Niggas try to say what I want
What's the deal, let's keep this blunt
We only try'nna have some fun
How can, I get you home?
I searched, you're not the typical kind of guy
Your moves they, definetly caught my eye
I like the way you take the beat slow
After the party is on




Yeah, yeah, yeah
From the Slums of Shaolin
Hillside Scramblers, we out the garbage, niggas
What? Huh? You ain't think I was gon' come back, huh?
Did ya? It's U-G-O-D-Zilla
That's right, that's right, Hillside Scramblers
The gram handlers is back, yo Mark, yo Mark
Yo, spark that track, baby!




Ight, now, this is how we gon' do this shit
Youknowhatimsaying? Niggas wasn't out in the streets back then
When was doing this shit son, youknowhatimean?
Yeah, check the story


I done flushed bags of powder down project toilets
You could of found of me on the steps dusted, unable to call it
Jums in my pocket, the rental was stolen, tapping pockets
On the local drug dealers, just to see what they holding
I know, niggas with crack viles stuck to they colon
The acid, done bubbled up, now they stomach's is swollen
That just, life in the hood, surrounded class, who we bag in our stash
The ultraviolet haze, we hit it and pass
We toast to the Ghost of old days, yeah, old ager hump
We rap renegades, must stay paid

 + (Ghostface Killah)
Get money (get money) Get money, Ghost (get money)
Get money (get money) Get money, Ghost (get money)


Big fluffed out gooses on, Stan Smiths
The housing cops can suck our dicks, we jumping out of convertible matchbox shits, next drip inhaling
Chilling, my throat frozen, my orange brick
Bottles of Cru', bitches with Baby Phats, they swinging ax
They singing, you still blinging, daddy, now bring it back
To smoke these rap niggas, honey, I'mma need a match
To bust the game wide open, I'mma need an ax
I juggle this, practice, smuggle heroin in the cactus
Keep it hood, I still go and fuck a fat bitch
Actress, slinging the backs of five Cleopatras
A cocaine Chef, I stretch money like elastic, nigga
My raps is bigger, dynamics with the muscle advantage
Jay Cutler on dust, when I blam shit




Yo, we been bagging since 18, kid, Polo Rugs on with gloves on
Rented cars, fronting on winning broads
Gum slow, half moon, leather pants, Avia' days
Keep your hands off my blunt and my waves
Benetton, Superman bomb, everybody in the lobby, we clapping
Hats on, protecting your moms, you know how we play
Spray something down if the team say
It's on, I dedicate my lines to the PJ's
Triple beams, Pyrex jars, smoking nickle weeds
All we did is look mad fly, icicle rings
Whatever homeboy, you want it? You could get your receipt
A little closer, you can sense we got heat, it's only me
Plus four other ill gangstas, we all anxious
To blow up your block and spank shit




Yo, I'm down for the get down, hit the town, sick the bloodhounds on 'em
I rip clowns, I flip pounds, I spit rounds
I'm on the prowl, my stomach growl, crushed by the crowd
Rush through Loud Records, drop mushroom clouds
I'm not a rapper, I'm spellbound, I melt down
Your G-Force, with heat walks
Free falling to a better money, bet he's hungry
Spread the honey, big head inside the Humvee
Mix lead inside my lungies, spend bread on my Dungarees
And such and such, Ghost plugged me with this slut
Bitch, don't hug me, bug me, I'm ugly when I fuck
I'm hard like a jungle hunter, bust off in Heather
Double cross me, lift your boss off your feet, 'course he's feather
Whatever, whatever, he cried indepence
Tennis players get fried, playing both sides of the ends
Keep your eyes on your friends, cuz they spy for the feds
Watch me rise from the dead, I got ties with the dreads

Aiyo, aiyo
Take you back far nigga, go get the ganja
Pass me the wine, I do it on time
New style worthwhile, young child, get wild
Then I live foul, before I give you a smile
Do best, smoke cess, just rest, I confess
This style came stacked like packs of Guiness
Wait, hesitate, watch the shit sound great
Then debate, nigga tapes, so now you all had a plate
Before I let go, like the funk freak flow
But soon to be true, cuz my style is crazy new
Never said old, cuz it's never been told
Foulin' up on the mic, get me, hell no
You beggin' and please to see me, flip keys
You brag about show off, achoo, I sneeze
This the shit that got everybody rockin' heat
Lex Diamonds, C-Muska son, lets take the streets

Roll one up, son, I stay spliffted
Bring your boys in, I poison your district

Yeah, them niggas, wit triggas on your hitlist
Drop ballistic, warheads, you kissed it
Sip the Mystic, it's liquid liquid
It's rigid rigid, it's cold frigid frigid
Boy, you missed it, it's Chad Muska
Teamed up with the Wu Gotti hustlas
Body bust your shit, throw the rhyme
Touch down on the dime, then I nose grind off (pop off nigga!)
Show your shines off, blow your mind
I'll give it to you, just one more time
Then that's it, ain't nothin' stoppin' ya
The city's the playground, another obstacle

Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu (represent, word up)
Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu (yeah yeah nigga what)
Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu (represent, represent)




Good God, ugh!


I got air suspension, hydraulics, in the cockpit
Thumpin' heavy watters, my stereo's bionic
Soul sonic force, wood grain, dual exhaust pipes
Fuel is lost, when thrown in overdrive
A hundred horsepowers and the hood motorized
The super charger take you on a roller coaster ride
Don't worry if you slide, I got four wheel drive
When I glide down Interstate 95
Heard additional miles heading for the high
With my halogen lights, with my buggy eye
Bring truck, serious guy rims, supersized
When I pull up to your side that's, when you realize
That I'm live on your set, pedestrians sweat
Cuz they catch whiplash when they turn they neck
With a multi disc changer, plus casette
This is for them low riders that burn the strip


Driving down the strip, I'm smoking out
Roof ripped, deep dish, rims pokin' out
(Ride higher, good God)
Never ever ever ever gonna stop
As the chrome blades chop and I'm rollin' out
(Ride higher, good God)


I got burners in the stashbox, Gucci ragtop
It's a brand new boy, toy, not a Matchbox
Jealous hoes try to key it up, with scratch marks
That's the price you pay, when you park after dark
Narc's try to search her, cuz she wax the Impala
Road kill on my crash bar, just demolished
It takes hard earned dollars, to keep us served
TV's in the head rest, serve your purpose
My Xbox control, by the steering wheel color
Fancy fur rug match with the W's on 'em
Peel out in the large OVM Pirelli
Drive on the sour, make ya spine turn jelly
Blueberry in my hand, blow out the sunroof
Dodging potholes, trying to not dent the Coupe
Air vent cool me off, when you hot pursuit
Them little press on hubcaps are not the truth




If you love fast cars, come ride with me
Come roll with me, come ride with me
If you love big trucks, come roll with me
Come ride with me, come roll with me


Now what can you tell me, if my Fendi glasses
Throw up my nose, at the low E classes
No smoke in my backseat, I don't need ashes
Behold the masses, scoping me out
Now driving down the strip, I'm smoking out
Not a Blood or a Crip, but I'm loc'ing out
With fast cars on the fast lane, on a fast route
Interior flushed out, you know what I'm about




Driving down the strip...






The Chinese have a saying: "Dangerous men will meet in narrow streets." And so it was. We were raised between the clans, and that meant pressure on me to make more weapons. And as word of the gold shipment spread, strangers suddenly appeared in jungle village


 Machete still stainless
The archbishop run from the narcs
A crisp biscuit plus play the harp, wrist glisten
Goon captain, catch me in Africa black down with 4 5 Somalians
Black Tims, rubber suit Wonder Woman bangle a blue coupe
I'm usually upon the roof countin' mad loot
Root beer reefer, teeth frame, doin' my 1, 2
Smokin' with a plain Jane trooper
Excellent with rifles, out in Japan
In a flight goose switchblade that poke out the Nike boots
Thrusted on a bullet train with chains on, gettin' my train on
Thunder money, make bread, brainstorm
All this is made for the Forbes list
Broads get pissed, say "Yo he fucked me out his drawers he dissed me"
All this is calculated, the Batman with a black hand
Mafia money, killas who rock tans


Bone crushing, smooth kicks, blades choppin' through bricks
Masters of the weaponry, sells to both cliques
Blacksmith, with the iron fist
X2


Rigor mortis, I watch the body rot to the bone structure
Scrape out your brain, watch your eyeballs rupture
Black magic, leave your fuckin' skull in a soup pot
Makaveli, Vamoose like 2pac
Suicidal tendencies, down the white Hennessy
Look in the book, I'm the definition of menace b
Chokin' niggas out for no reason, it's duck season
I'm cold as ice, 6 degrees below freezing
Stay dipped, rock a striped shirt like Freddy Kreuger
You'se a baby piranha surrounded by barracudas
Seven thirty, I'm more like 6 o' clock
Straight up and down beatin' up niggas till there's blood in they socks
Ox em, duff em', stuff 'em in black bags
Without gettin' no blood on my fresh rags
Ruthless, heart of a stone, grown with no emotions
I piss out brewhas, poisonous potion




Yeah, it's the three deadly venoms with weapons in the denims
Some shit that'll shake windows and break lay tenants
Come left field, aim crooked and straight blaze in em
Have you niggas with straight-legs with a fake leg in em
Wolf in sheep's clothing, eyes scoping a tender lamb
Spin you bitches like a ballroom dinner dance
G-Mode dress code got suspender clamps
Russian roulette, money bet, go and spend your chance
You little fleas get killa bees and army ants
EMS cut up your jeans like zombie pants
Hollow chrome to your collarbone
Ping against your dome piece and sound like the first key on a xylophone
Grown men discussing death and the malice tone
See how quick the smiley faces turn solid stone
Ghostface, Rae and G be the wildest known
We straight street, we keep seat in the palace throne






Yo, yo, yo
I be that rocket launcher that caught ya
Rock of Gibraltar
Spill blood on the altar
Sorcerer
Flyin' saucer in the Porsche
Money exhaust
The enforcer of the lowest bars
Fist of the Northstars
Water on Mars
Thoughts like a porn star, born scarred
War Lord of the snow ball, break dance on cardboard
Fiends gnaw for the raw, mark four
Hard jaw like Mexican, next to win
Crack a Beck's yo I'm vexed again
Next to run, revolving door
Killing floor
Searchin' for the genie's lamp
Arrow in your heart like Beanie Man
Seeded plant full blown
See me vamp
Wolf fangs, full moon
Full spoons of Oxycontin
Catch him at the Roxy
Spot him up in Harlem
Honey with the knocked knees with the foxy bottom
News paper column
Say he's scary
Fuck the fairy ass niggas
Jump back in your rat hole
And throw another hail mary
Style's flurry, I'm the cherry on top
Money phase done lit up
One, two, three up
Your popcorn shrimp, I'm the whole re-up
G's up and hoes down
Fake as the game is
I blow down the whole town
Let off a whole round
Ghetto celeb
One thing's for certain a hundred years from now no one really cares
Smoke threads, Pro Keds, Coke heads, mo-peds
Fiends fight
Peace pipes
Yo I'm outta here






Go head..


Give me all Gucci colors, my niggas get real for brothers
We idolize big lines and nines
Jumping out of big joints live, projects
Lot of objects, front if you want, you gon' die
Lex with a sawed off, Killah gonna tax him in the Waldorf
All bloodhounds, pop, show it off
Actin' like that money ain't live
Built it from the getty-up, New York City gonna fry
Aiyo, son, I take mines, rape lines
Yeah, I'm realer than Rikers who orchestrate great crimes
Jump out the Lex', lookin' zesty, real Nestle
What, picture nigga, except bless me
God, I'm high-powered, gun of the hour, crafted Flowers
Give it the blend, double it, and blow like the Towers
All ya'll need to take showers, can't take what's ours, pa..
Been sellin' crack, been sellin' crack
Been sellin' crack, livin' the black
Revealin' how we flip that, strip cats
We write rich raps
Help out the body
Me, similar to the Gotti story
I'm kinda young, son, a fly forty
The Reverend cold shittin' on shorty, did it to shorty pop
And gave him like ten in his jaw piece
Remember this sayin': "Staten Island Gun Slayers"
It's mayors, all gauges, minimum wage the raises..


...like to Rock..


Niggas be killin' me, actin' like they ain't feelin' me
Knowin' they bustin' them guns with my artillery
Usin' my words as if it's his and hers
That's that shit that make me not wanna pass the herb
The fake artist, I'm coming Razor Sharp regardless
I bump lah, sowed of liquor, light and spark
Make it crunk live, the dirty dirty try and serve me
Like black folks in scary movies: you die early
Tony Toca, Meth Tical, vida loca
Esta loca, if she think I eat the chocha
Ma, toss the, smoke ya, win free (Winfrey) like Oprah
And un-hoast that roast, your meat, for the butcher
Licky lost ya, don't even come a step closer
When I approach a track, I slam like my culture


Chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that


GZA told you it's a "Cold World", where ya heat at?..


...like to Rock..


Hots on the shit, just so we can lock horns
Throw a package in the streets, get the block warm
Something happens when we meet, hit the block strong
Get it poppin' in your face, taste the popcorn
Now that we back on track, can't lose
My back gets huge, bitches Moulin Rouge
The way I move, the Cadillac, so smooth
Battle rap improve shit, light the fuse
Bruised off the booze liquor, doozy kicker
The dynamite style, shinin' lights still flicker
Wu-Tang stickers is a nuclear reaction
Tony Touch scratch the table, RZA on the back end
Pure, the talent, yes, yours truly
The brand combination of jazz, class and beauty
Here to do my duty, up another notch
The gospel according to rap is mega watts
Agenda never stop, dead center, mega hot
Go mop it up, go cop it when it drops..


Woman, you sure like to Rock..


Haha, come on over here..




At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Cheeba in my pipe, watch the burn
Thinking bout my girl, she's my sweetheart
Today she's acting like a functioning retard
She took my car, brung it back in three parts
Late night call, to come to the ER
Friday night, she out with her friends
Her and them bitches done crashed the Benz
Man, I told the bitch about an SAI
Stupid And Intoxicated, while she high
I been told her, not to drink and drive
Now the judge slammed the hammer and she might do time


Yo, she's all about the party (Friday night)

I took a purple rock candy, at the dub step festival
Yo, I'm signing autographs, started feeling like a vegetable
Here come the sexual, sensual, sorta intellectual
Touching on my testicle, the music up a decibel
At night, she's a freak, by day, she's a principal
I'm sipping on Ciroc, I'm feeling type invincible
We sitting in the trailer, her head game exceptional
Up and down on the pipe, her porn star professional
Hold up, is this real? Everything is questionable
Let's take it down a notch, smoke this medicinal

Got a letter from L.A., it was from my ex
Said she had my baby, ain't seen her yet
Five years done passed, I'm a daddy
I remember that ass, whoo, she had a fatty
A video vixen, act kinda grown
She said she can raise it, all on her own
She said see me money and leave me alone
Stress is a killer, then she hung up the phone
Fucking bitch...

Huh, after all these years, what you said was true
The Shaolin and the Wu-Tang is very dangerous

Hahahahahah


It's the ODB kid, once again coming through your area
And I'm going to tell you one time, you gon' love this


I had to get the money, said it wasn't a choice
Die Hard's on the bars, Ladies lovin' the voice
Morphine flow, numbing your joints
Bomb a nigga like he number 81 from Detroit
Zombie life, World War Z
Antidote to your virus, your highness, the world on me
Capital G, cool as the dude from Dos Equis
So deadly, I don't make it rain, I snow heavy
Sick lane, Nic Cage how I ride with fire
Forever with bars, sort of like a lifer
With the son of anarchy, I be breaking bad
Walking dead, day dreaming of making a band
Dancing with the stars, Americans idol me
The mentalist with the Big Bang Theory


Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


The most duplicated, anticipated, validated
Urban legends in the books with the ones who made it
Highly celebrated, everything was work related
Current top 40 got the Wu deep in all their business
20 years Killa Bees, yeah, we hold the pennant
Monumental stance on the cover with my co-defendants
Drop her sentence, in remembrance
Construct these jewels so they can live through my descendants


Youngun, I can see your draws, pull your pants up
Can't even call yourself a man until you man up
And if you call yourself a fan you need to stand up
This ain't a party, it's a jux, keep your hands up
And I don't care who runs the city when the summer come
Your summer's done, Wu forever, and we're still number one


Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


Picture a nigga on the strip getting rich off the drug shit
Putting other niggas on, teaching em thug shit
Then they want stick 'em up, then they get slugs quick
Hood-type niggas always living that crime life
Jealous-ass grimy niggas seeing the limelight
Slimy old nigga like fucking your mans wife
Fool shouldn't use the word brother, he man dyke


Yo, I spin my web all across New York
Get it out in all types of ice, there's a sport
One chain, two chain, three chain, four
Niggas mouth's drop like the leaves in the fall
Tone got that WBC
I take off heavy in air balloons and land in the Fiji's
That's my bird and that's my word
You faggots keep fucking around and get curbed
(I came to town)


Forms circles like the rings of Saturn
Dust rocks and ice in a particular pattern
Then this fascinating picture has emerged from surface
A wonder of the young world with an urgent purpose
A wild fire engulfing every home
It's history chiseled and carved in every stone
A workshop where skills are learned
Handcrafted and drafted, written works the main concern
Urban center provided with a social structure
And a curious culture full of superconductors
Each stain is part of a scene with
Intricate geometric raps on a larger screen
Spell bounding, marvelous and it's surrounding
Viewpoints remain the same, it's all astounding
A place where the forgotten art is so powerful
A striking image is something that's so valuable


This one's the blackout! Three-fifty-seven to your mouth!


GZA, this is called Ruckus In B Minor
Rae, all those bad times is behind us
Ghost, put that mask on to remind us
Method Man, let 'em know who's New York's finest


Youngun, I can see your draws, pull your pants up
Can't even call yourself a man until you man up
And if you call yourself a fan you need to stand up
This ain't a party, it's a jux, keep your hands up
And I don't care who runs the city when the summer come
Your summer's done, Wu forever, and we're still number one


Still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


Now I'mma let all you motherfuckers know
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga
I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker!


My lines is like Peruvian coke, go ahead and try one
My recipe is A1 remarkable with my mixture
Rainman mathematician, this city slicker
The finest threads cover my frame, the cloths of royalty
Strive with an army of winners and no pretenders
(*One*) We live free and achieve more
But first we gotta win with no stalemate
The all eye seeing is victorious biz to the sound man


Armored trucks, tanks are bulletproof, been the truth
Loot the track, clear the booth, my thought ready, aim, shoot
My knowledge one twenty proof, let's tear the roof off
Let's spray, M-A-S-T-A
King I Love-Love club, pack stadium rock
I hold the mic snug, split a slug
Black ninja, mask and gloves


Still number one, still number one





Countdown...


Are you ready? Are you mad inside?
Got you strapped down to your seats
Outta the doorway, bullets ripped, full clip
God speed, approach follow my lead
Fire winds gust, empire crush
Full thrust, fall in the hole, roll wit the rush
Untouchable chunk of earwax and soul
Sound waves slay out the bat cave smoke
My belly-full prance dance, avalanche quote
Down slope, elegant as Fantasia
Killer whale tale inhale, black male from Asia
All out the wood works, hood shirts and wizards
No match, unhatch, the rap is rigid
In the shaft, shotty cocked, hip hop to the limit
Nightwatch, pad mark
Sparks spin a quake nuclear blast, heavy on the cash
Gimmie what it takes NOW!!

Chorus  2x
RAGE ROCK ROLL FIGHT
BRAWL FALL RUMBLLLLLLEEE!!!


The diabolic witty, dialect's darker than Gotham City
With the possibility to stop your walkin ability
God forgive me, spark enemies with pistol grips
The missile tip's impact hit you so hard, you shit through your dick
Official scripts strikes when physical hits
You physical bitch, watch for the imperial blitz, serious shit
Submit, subject to the wreck war tone, and thought poems
Liver than WWF Warzone
Walk upon them Gotti tracks, bodies collapse
Rap for lottery stacks, shatter like when pottery cracks
Logical facts from the terror dome
Spill from the guts, trail to you ?puss? from where you bust
In God you now entrust
Dog you like hound and mutts, Pound Pups get sound struck
Clown what? You'll get drowned in the cut
While crowd round up

 (x2)


A-yo, yo;
I spit bars, travelling tremendous speed measuring far
Been busting satellites circling Mars
Verbal onslaught, bring forth physical force
Of a hundred wild niggas piled in a Trojan Horse
Thought method, set it on generic mic ethic
Professional neck shit, left foes beheaded
This music, is mind control like computer chips
Been doing this for numerous years, refuse to lose it
With turbo tactics, maneuver like a trained soldier
Hall of Fame flame thrower, take game, it's game over
Ayatollah, high roller nine totter
Mind controller, 2009 time folder
My coalition, bring the demolition
Wu-blade decision, slate the competition, wit no intermission
Spitting hazardous darts, up front like Rosa Parks
Makin million men march

 (x2)


Yo, who got next? Meth got next
I chin check, all these MC's line em up god, I go Jihad
Declare holy war, it be hard to dip and dodge
Police squads trying to bogard, we rip and rob
The boulevard ain't safe for your kids, that's how it is
In the ghetto, we ain't scared to death, but scared to live
So Goldy, mosey to the spot, get that moldy
Rusty-ass .38 Special, niggas owe me
Slowly I turn, face the one and only
Naughty By Nature, I Do My Dirt All By My Lonely
Ask Pretty Tony, when I got a bitch I keeps a bitch
36 Chambers, Enter at your own risk
Take that watch off and tuck your necklace
City never sleeps, streets is restless
Rap style'll slave you, when you least expect it
Pull the plug on your respirator, leave you breathless
Wu-Tang forever and a day, better warn your boys
I deploy battleship rap, seek and destroy

Chorus 2x



Yo, yo...

Chorus: u-god
You can't hack the tactics
Of a semi-automatic full rap fanatic
You can't hack the tactics
Of a semi-automatic full rap fanatic

Verse one: u-god
I make mean lean when I pump my spunk
And hands of chump, of machine gun funk
I bliss, like the fist, of the mantis
Those who oppose get dropped and hit the canvas
With rigormor', I hit you in the core and
Pop your legs well in the figure four
You can't stop the force when the blood is coursin
Extortion, I'm comin like the headless horseman
Enforcin, tortureous slang from a fortune
Swordsman, throw your rap corpse in coffins
Don't pop Glocks at me then cop a plea
A hundred thousand leagues beneath the sea
Deep depths makes rappers salted
Weak rappers asses I cracks my foot, off in
Lay down them lines with them hard hits
And I'm harmin, bombin, with heavy bombardments
Pushin, poetry, like weed by the pounds
Underground railroad rza track lay it down
I'm hard as pavement, you gaze from amazement
Knock you in the head you wonder where the days went
It's golden bangles, microphone getting strangled
Five-star general, scars you want to angle
Bizarre thriller, war scar for a killer
Sheisty mic device got my hand-piece throbbin
Slice mics precise on down to ice carvings
Chorus 2x

Verse two: inspector deck
Yo
I set the mic in flames, bomb like fighter planes
Mc's are shot down long range with sniper aim
No question marks, the session starts with sparks
My flows explodes like hand grenades through your parts
Universal soldier, mo's the holder
Globe in both hands, born to be sole controller
Hit the world full blast, my crime pays cash
Slip past these cyphers and the flash from the photograph
Best-seller compose a rough draft
Razor sharp vocabulary cut glass
Actual facts crowds of thousands collapse
You can't catch my style with bugs and phone taps
Whether rhymes or crimes, I want mines regardless
Hard targets, underground like black markets
Pirates of the darkest water feel the aura
Importer of rough raps that's snuck cross the border
Semi-automatic attack'll spray y'all
Liquid sword swingin slay all, I'm awol
Chorus 1.5x

Verse three: street thug
Wu-tang be, killin you softly with this song
You won't survive the outcome I bring def jams to your eardrums
P.l.o. hits the hardest, regardless
Felony offenders catchin murder one charges
Open cases, got me smoked out in staircases
The dark crusader jackin cats in elevators
I strike back like the jedi, from n.y
It's I illifyin, dope rhyme supplyin
I be all you need to rock these mic devices
Projectile shaolin style exiles your juvenile freestyle
I'm not your basic street entrepeneuer, crime tour, packs the luger
High pursuit for the cream like the bodyguard from bejing
Inject you with the morphine, then I flee the murder scene
On your facilities, the penalty, doa
Bomb shell your burrow like bombay
Opposites attack that's why these thieves stay strapped
As we, travel the glove to put shaolin on the map
I show loyalty, to my fans fully
Operational raps, that bust through your skully
I'm rated second-to-none I be the top gun
From the land of the slums spittin blades from my tongue
Park your slug slinger, hit you with the sleeper
Hit-seeker, sounds that be a-ttackin your speaker
Watch me bang the headpiece kid there's no survival
My flow lights up the block like a homicidal
Murder, underground beef for the burger
P.l.o., criminal thoughts you never heard of




You can't hack the tactics
Of a semi-automatic full rap fanatic
You can't hack the tactics
Of a semi-automatic full rap fanatic


I make mean lean when I pump my spunk

Murder, underground beef for the burger
P.L.O., criminal thoughts you never heard of




I despise your killing and raping
You're despicable (Are you my judge?)
It's just you should be punished
I'm gonna chop off your arm, so are you ready?


Check these high hats sling tings moving through the rubbish
Party robust, rec room style for you brothers
Time's ticking, erupt misconduct
Entering one funk before the drum dry up
Dial, style, jab vocab slow
Alphabet run, construction voice might blow
Tap dance swelling Hemingway novel model
For a breather, dirty reefer hide your bottle
Cut down, come with something that's round and profound
Blood brothers, people of colors, we get down
Watch this fly, force feed things being said
Nine Diagram acid black evil red leathers
Mic half a dangle, serious a man
My mic clapper death wish, everlasting plan
Heavenly God body, know me as the cleaner
Night champion, old villain style seamer
Kiss a spider, Seagal saga why bother
Godfather talk drama, fly swatters


Number two, Chao San Poi


This Wu shit be hard to kill and full blown
Rhymes filtered through the net before words hit the chrome
Pro tools editing tracks that's rough
Cause a jam without a live MC isn't enough
So we attack this and grab all within reach
Throw a scrap back to niggas,perfect your own speech
Shit is copper, it ain't worth the mic stands
Used by backup singers in Atlantic City bands
Niggas look on and get hooked on this mic line
Reeled in and shipped through the pipeline
LPs delivered with style and potential
Niggas flowing smoothly in a sequential
Order, revealing hidden tape recorders
Stashed inside pockets of those who lack aura


Twist the DAC up, them niggas with math is back up
Watch he act up, fifty-two block track we slap up
Playground manoeuvre, jet to Vancouver like this
Two Kahluas one chick, she's German Luger
Get the shit on, light a fresh pack, bust it open
With the seal on Dunn, deal on this, with the real on
Necks rocky ring, call it the Decatur
Slang soufleer home decorater, player
Mic immigrants, nine of us formed resemblance
Somethin flashy, God dead-armed is nasty
Peep the ornaments enough to make Shorty-Wop stare at me yo
He killed the God might as well throw a chair at me


Yo MC's wonder what's Hip Hop thunder
Tell you the truth it's just one nation under a groove
Gettin down for the funk of it
Like Fred Sanford in the biz...
Yo inhale this paraphernalia, a Wu memorabilia
Melba the fortune teller, tried to tell ya
Bout the group recruit we scoop up CREAM like Breyer's
Then spread across the globe like telephone wires
Thirty-six assorted, Shaolin imported
Chambers been recorded, you're fuckin with the loops
Time for royalty audit
Fabulous establishment metabolism, Blackfoot Indian
Cherokee started out smaller than amphibian
Then grew to a physical body with five meridians
As the pendulum swings closer to the millenium
Two thousand, wickedness is spread amongst my citizen
I got a muscle the industrial to make a hustle
And politic with Lyor and Russell
When niggas is still rushin we'll brush you


He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives


Thoughts are contained in the trenches of the brain
Ignite, blowing the mic to Arabian heights
As I recite this medley, niggas couldn't fuck with the
Deadly ground I hold down
Classical gangland style, shots hit the ceiling
Panic and confusion echoes through the building
Continuing to build, I strive for perfection
Driven by the will to live, Glocks I hold
Shots I give, while searchers of rescue teams
Look for means of survival and who's liable
For this harrowing experience
You scream for the extreme, fiend for the cap
And proceeds of the Wu-Tang Academy
To fuck up your anatomy with assault and battery


Number two, Chao San Poi
Number two, Chao San Poi
He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives
Number one, Yen Chang Wa
He's an adulterer, don't trust him
Number two, Chao San Poi
Number two, Chao San Poi
He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives
I despise your killing, and raping
You're... despicable
Are you, my judge?
It's just... you should be punished
I'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?
I despise your killing, and raping
You're... despicable
Are you, my judge?
It's just... you should be punished
I'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?




To my hard rocks, locked in cell blocks, never shell shock
Melt the ox in your face, displaced in the penalty box
My enemies heart pumps poisonous blood, your choice, the slugs
You do dirt in the rain, than your name is mud
Major love to thugs in the back of the clubs
Strapped for what? TO avoid bein stuck and blazed up
Laced up, struck from the waste up, embraced by the muts in the cut
Bullets sizzle up, leave you fist fucked, intense cut
]From Leatha and Uey, verbal gymnast
Volvo, physical fitness, over tracks leave statistics
Tripped into the realm with chrome shines like sunlight
Half of my life is right, the other half is a gun fight
Uptight jake harassin for college satisfaction
101 question askin in back of the paddy wagon


Sadly, tragedy happen
Lost in captivity, imagine me happily clappin
Big barrels, heavy ammo, man the mammal
Packed in commando, rapidly practice supreno
Crack my fingers on pianos
I torture you with orchestra tackle on your back, the jackel
No time to react, combat, flyin scrap metal
Kamikaze degrees, cherry instant fire, live wire
Dunn, rock it til your knees drop, over tree tops
Collosal current enforcin, outer bridge crossin
One foot first, is the rebirth, the crime arson
Caution, furnace flyin, deserters try to black ball us
Over the face of the Earth's surface
The heat is heatin up, demon from the east wing
Hitman's bullet, leave you barely breathin and barely seein
A critically blaze, biblical plague in amaze
Riddle the box, smmothered in cops
Sky hugger, Space Jam, slam in the blizzard of rocks
A space invader, laced with lazers and with omega weapons
Magnificent 7, this cannibal mouth, gangsta spectrum
Form an animal house, fume at 11


We shell shocked, we burn hotter than a meltin pot
Your skeleton drop, as your cells start to pop
We dwell on blocks, while you cats held my the cops
Blow fire from you tops, your expired by the shots
Hot wired by the watts, exterminate ya, terminate ya
War displayed by the real niggas


On his wrist saw the spiral, glass hand
Last man to eat tracks like you straight up, hit up a white dude
Jean jacket, Austrailian gats, Mediterainian raps
Play the back with the joint on his neck
Who feelin this? Thugs love this, we way above sea level, love
Check out the glove, stay bloodied up, plug this
Verbal hygiene, the Golden Arm, plus niggas stay warm
See ya out in Mexico, we implantin The Swarm
All niggas snatch money, watch the sweater, criticize my Fila
Sneakers cost cheddar, with the heat out
Brolic, extra large, dynamic, crack your ceramic in half
Go against The Grain, we feedin you math
What up? Niggas call it high-tech, big shank reign
Straight out the kitchenette, jums in the set
Before I go, analyze all money go
Yeah, you seen him, a 6 double O, rockin bummy clothes


Bloody Red Hook, money and crooks
Get out my face with them funny looks, ya better off studyin books
Let the weed burn, they brain dead, I feed em the worms
Y'all be actin up and showin off, in needin to learn
You know the sun shines as the Earth turns
Nowadays is the ghetto germ, knockin off whoever concerned
I dip your brain in the blood of fire, prophecize like Jeremmiah
Turn a crowd to a choir, hot wired space ships
Fed niggas who I hate with, I be Apocalyspe, Tales of the Crypt
Raise the dead out the realm with a 6
Overwhelmed by the smell of the clips, gun smoke, shots hit
We surrounded by Hell and politics, bulletproof or hollow tips
I'm the silencer on the loudest clip
The widow maker, Heaven Razah, put of curse on whoever major
Snatch the belt off the heavy weighter
I be a Swarm alligator, slap niggas way across equators
When the dare try to flaunt they paper



* Various talk in club with Poppa Wu sample in background *






When I'm locked down I use Timbs as my shower slippers
I'm in the background mingling with the powder flippers
In the basement, hard-body power lifters
I crush sour in the sifter, see how I lift her
Universal God I stay scientific
The kid with the Golden Arms, Iron Fisted
Stay Asiatic, so cinematic
Noise in the attic, bang out with them automatics
It's hood politics that bring the hunger back
I'm straight chopping wood, call me the lumberjack
Check the catalog put out a hundred packs
Watch for drug sniffing dogs they coming from the back
I'm straight thunder clap the funky drummer's back
It's pure Dopium, give em a heart attack
I stay stacking plaques like ancient artifacts
Joe Namath in the game I'm the quarterback


Eight balls of coke, blunt to the greenery
Pounds in the trunk get you a concrete scenery
Handmade ox'll get you dumped in the mess hall
Snitch niggas run to C.O.s to confess all
This is street knowledge, knowledge I school college
Like a speech from the GZA, sharp like the RZA
Don't run with a scissor, nigga the truth is the
Truth, now I'mma drop a few jewels in the booth
Used to boot crack, stuff em inside a tennis ball
Ans throw it when they rushing the block, trust no cops
Driving around with two mitts in my socks
Cooked coke gon' get you in more trouble than money
Don't crawl through dust juice the pigs is hungry
You think they ain't watching
They watching while you uptown copping
Back home while you're cooking and chopping
They scheming on the block waiting to get it popping


He had a sword and an axe with cuts
Under a road that was woven from silver and gold, waxed it up
His army was so great in quantity
His crops and livestock boost the economy
Many would travel by boat to see him
His image adorned most schools and coliseums
A merchant, hustle those silk and velvets
Portrait illuminated when the torch was well-lit
Picture so beautifully painted that
One thought it would breathe or move cause it would leave a mood
Or energy, you see his wife practiced Yoga
Made herbal enhancers that had saved the soldiers
Guard the treasures in the chambers, halls and vaults
Well-prepared for all assaults
Heavy guarded village
Armed with the sharpest weapons designed to pierce and cause blood spillage


From a young teen, a murder team, inspired by crime
See Allah Just granted permission for my position
Sit down, write rhymes, escaping this repetitive cycle
Slinging dimes, losing time, doing hard time
Teaching y'all mathematically, come see
The epitomy of what you wanna be - emcee
My semi-auto gun mandatory at the sound clash
The mic touched, dance mashed up, pounds of the best
Green glass bottles of don, I sip the liquor slow
Flow so devastating when I go solo
Even when I'm dolo, pretty gun I'm holding
Head swollen off the solid gold soul
Iron Mic pole beat your face like you stole something, trust me
Living life royalty, all wise and healthy
Welcome to the best of me, from knowledge to infinity
Never stopping my projectory, I'm galactic


Yo, peace to all of the gods and all of the earths
We been building like this ever since the first day of birth
The more I start to build, the better I feel
Keep ignorant niggas from me, use dummies for shield
You're not Godbody son, you're just garbage and real snotty
Cherry head gaylord still stuck in the lobby
This the first Now Born, son I'm blessed with mad lessons
Conquered crazy devils, my mind is a weapon
You can't fast with me and avoid the swine
You degenerate emcee, I'm the best of mankind
Allahu Akbar straight jewels and real stars
I'm down with the RZA, got help for the Widow's Son
Pop off on you, you ain't nothing to me - DUN DUN
Original Tyzeem, Holy water, Visine
Designated wordplay, God respect my deen
Shine on little stars and respect the Queen


New York Giant, call me Deck Umenyiora
Fresh with the water connect, two and a quarter
Deal with the dealer, don't trust the transporter
My job is done once I get it to the border
Perico, coke game is kilos of cocaine
Hypodermic needle to the groove, I dose veins
Overdoser, you know the product is raw right
Lines take you there like I wrote it with off-white
Got him bent up, hands looking like a tin cup
Sorry no consignment, get your ends up
Move from the gate now, he on his way straight to Jake now
I'm on the hush with my weight loud
Got the shakes now, how they want it bad
Five or six heads chipping in for a bag
I got the works like a burger deluxe
Get your fix while I'm serving it up, word to us



Intro:
Skyscrapers (x3)


Watch how I swing 'em, past the Apollo, past Jimmy Jaz
Easy on the throttle
Skyline glittah
Crooks in the night
This fucked up apple let me take a bite
Push back the drop, lights on the stretch
Then I hit the dutch twice
Left me sundrenched
Freeway a life we might just bump heads
All these hood niggas in front the projects
Tweet all the masses, plans to bomb threat
See 'em on the block, salute the young vets
Used to move with the best, now they call them the elite
Inner city dudes, bad news with the heat
Girl you're in for a treat, no keys in the pocket
Push button seats, jump start the rocket
Pennies, for profit, minks up in the closet
Southern fried birds get seasoned with the arson


Big city life (skyscraper)
Big city lights (skyscraper)
Big city life (skyscraper)
Big city lights (skyscraper)


Bitches and fame, came from the hustle
The will and the power, came from the struggle
Violence on the Island, cause niggas to crumble
Behind the dumpster, all day we hustle
Shots to the vertebrae, murder rate doubled
Then the ambulance came, zip lock the duffle
Stick up, kids, in the sports bar
Shots in the hill, by Stapleton Park
It's one of them nights, wish upon a star
That the hood might settle and peace may start
Police drive by, hide the marijuana
Chicks stroll by in 'Sace and Gabana
Once ain't enough, nigga, pass that raw
If I miss you three times, gon' catch bullet four






I can't get off my high horse
And I can't, let you go
You are the one, who
You are the one, who makes me feel
So real, heh yeah
No, what am I supposed to do
No, what am I supposed to do, baby
When I am so hooked out on you
Then I realized, that you are, somebody else's guy
Oh yeah, why you wanna go and do this to me, boy


You knew from the jump, I'm not a one woman man
That's how it started, get out my life, now scram
I don't give a damn, slam the door behind you
Need I remind you, don't let false love blind you
Cuz I wine and dine you with coiffure plates
Threw logs on the fire at the Pocono Estates
On Temptation Island, we was wrecked shipmates
I knew from the gate, you was kinda shiesty
You called all my numbers in my phone, you wasn't wifey
Go 'head try me, I plead my case
While you and your friend talk all day on the Sprint
How I ain't no good, better leave his ass quick
But you keep on stalkin' in the Ultima with tent
On some psycho shit, whoa, you make no sense
Peekin' over fences, you not my wiz
I just ran on through you and handled my biz


Can you remember, the times we spent together
Sharin' our days in the sun
That's when I found out, that you were somebody else's lover
And after all the plans we made, now they shattered
But still I


I can't get off my high horse, I can't let go
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Ooh, what am I supposed to do, when I saw you
And I realized, that you're somebody else's guy


See that day in September, I'm sure you can remember
That's when all the stuff hit the fan
You told me a lie, and you didn't have an alibi
But baby, hell, I still cared, you know I


Love you so, baby, that I can't let you go, no, no
You are the one that makes me feel so real
Ooh, what am I supposed to do, when I saw you
And I realized, that you're somebody else's guy


Read the letters sweetie, your style is fuckin' me up
Completely I ran, dropped you at the grand with the TV
Lacin' you with jewelry was nothin', brought a flower home, you frontin'
Couldn't even cook to do nothin'
Feel the pain and shit, the sexy and funny style, I laughed
Dick told me just lay in the shit
Now I'm givin' you what you gave me
Keep that broke ass nigga you got, hope he got your pocket
I'm airin', peace








On the mat,  head to toe Intacked on the track
Big hat's on the go, Let them ho's know we on a stroll
We on the track, The shit we started, we comin' back
In the market of rap, walkin 'man heart talkin
Superbowl ring, sun of soul king
Roll the red carpet, out the cockpit
Sharkskin garments, come out the closet
"ROCKS!" My pocket's don't understand lint
Place's i haven't been
This is it HollyWood handprint, written in cement
Bottom bitch, get that mint
Get that money not the honey rent
Need to feed is more legal
Ya too foxy ass, get that cash
Sparrows can't fly with eagles


Soul, Soul, need a taste
Mind right, head in the right place
Do what to do, like you supposed to be
Now, give up your chance... before the game's on me
Now bounce can you dig it, on the real side
Stay in the showcase, be satisfied
Now meet me at the pink house, that I tear down
Let everybody know, that everybody know
I made you squeeze, then hit your sound
Now bounce get up and do nigga's what you can
Everybody do ladie's what you can
"right" 28 physique, game don't mean nothing me
You can't run, hide, The games on me
"right" can you dig it?



It's just the vocab
Gift of gab
Like the river they call me
Rhymin' money on the wood
Go good right before I just 69 em'
Trick ass bitch nigga diamonds
Put her arm in perfect timing
Sweet signs a sin
Steady climbin
Always press fresh food on the table
On the move
Hash flourish
Ever since they prove
My stable every move is fatal
My step gonna survive
No jive
Talkin GMC
See the C bring it back to me
If it's alright with you it's alright with me
We could do like men how you want it to be
That shiny shake that blind mixtape's like pineapple grape
No time to escape
Pimp slap your face
On the hole is soul in the hole
Roll now blow

All big niggas heavy on the wrist play diss niggas

I'm a dollar and a dream from seein a brick
In grimy hallways, slingin nicks and treys
When it's on then it's on and poppin, shots lickin
I'm spittin this shit for the hood, Glock clickin
Tension in the street, we stressed, still wanna eat
I walk through the valley of death, the hotstepper
Holdin red pepper, everybody on reach
I need a beat to expand, the mind guide the hand
Pen stroke, excellent quotes of literature
Nights over Egypt, black as Arabia
Gundeliro self I savior, I need the (uh)

Aiyyo, aiyyo
Aiyyo I got the whip smellin like lemon
Roger Clemens jerseys the man blew seven cold coolies in the Worthy and
I crush those rappers, keep the toast near the rad-iator
We like our guns warm, it's easier to make the papers
Stayed off, the cape came off, Ghost G'd off
The track's like doin six months and I'mma beat off
At the airport attention always flow in my direction like
You let the best then sparkle his perfection and
Bitches be askin them, Ghost you got so much shit
You need to cash in, bracelets matchin 'em

"Since you're all so skilled

Yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah...
Let's go...
Yeah, listen...


The sound of the horns says it's on
We storm through like C. Thomas, Red Dawn
Step like a don through the city, Deck bonds
I get my hands dirty, Nikes scuffed, sweat pouring
Still I stay fresh with the fly white linen
Duece times 5, that's my type women
Sonny, I live it, O-10, S5 tinted
Brother Deck, what I rep, S.I., dig it?
Fifty cal' flow, get low
Intro to outro, bout it tho, whoa
Steady, heavy like a '52 Chevy
Niggas ain't ready, I turn out your lights like Teddy
Roll like dice in the casino
Known to spit lava, Heat like DeNiro and Pacino
Manifesto, Wu-Tang Gambino
Lay it down, then I fly off like the hero

"Wu-Tang!"
"Wu-Tang!"


The Wild Cowboy number one
G-O-D, how you gonna block out the son?
Read my jacket, my achievements stretch like a warning track catch
The in-crazable voice box, I throw you boys rocks
Diamonds and jewels, a holiday, pros that fuck in schools
I'm a tank, I stop panzers, take down stanzas
Sixteen bars, keep the car running
Broads stunting, feed ya self, kill ya self, take the pill
Punks jump up to get beat down
New York the sweet town I sorta, who's on tour?
Who the vile, truth can say, you ain't a slouch
Now Rule local, now I'm B.K. vocal
Right out the X, you can work out your pecs and your back
Can beat the death with bats, need to tune up, NJ'll turn the tune up
I'mma tell you who's soon enough to got
And I ain't down with getting crossed, and I never been the boss

"Wu-Tang!"


Yo, you're hog-tied, I'm roping them, bitches, I'm gropping them
Open up your veins, cop three bags of Dopium
Super soak these niggas, stroke with the magnum force
Leak it in the streets quick, peep my secret sauce
I keep it gloss, I'm suited up for my franchise
Your coins is tossed, man-handle bad guys
Scramble for my damn prize, crack cans of cold Guinness
I'm like Seabiscuit, I'mma win by a photo finish
Nigga, this ain't tennis, yeah, I ain't bluffing shit
I be the street menace on my David Ruffin shit
Police ain't cuffing shit, claiming I'm a crook
Throw up my middle finger, I'm a hall of famer in my book
Right hook, death jooks, great with my footwork
Bubble through, got the W on my hood shirt
Sneak through the wood works like poisonous high fumes
I'm that superhero with the brand new costume

"Wu-Tang!"
"Wu-Tang!"
"Wu-Tang!"
"Wu-Tang!"




Spit game..
Spit game..
Game..
Game..


I do the damn thing, toast the champagne
It's the Lord of the Rings, move in full swing
Nigga, fan the flames, expand my wings
Plus my vocal range, I shoot to mane
Call me Kurt Cobain, baptized in the flame
Capsized in the game, nigga, say the name
And I bang you out, with the Gang Land violence
And it's New York's finest, you've been ordained
With the deadly aim, don't think I won't shoot ya
Got more positions than the Karma Sutra, bitch
Call me Super, with the German luger
With the funky dope mauneuver, pass me the rude boy
Stainless steel toy, comin' to killjoy
The real mccoy's is coming to beat it
The best kept secret, shake the ground descend
Kick the door open when I release the bitch


Spit game (and they like it)
Spit game (when you have no vest)
Game (walking down the avenue)
Game (always coppin' somethin' new)


What you know about gangstas, thugs and real niggas
Niggas that get pussy, and niggas that just pussy
Hold it down, all the time, I ain't gotta spend a dime
Bust a cherry, and we dine, cuz fine, I pop wine
And I ain't got game, mami, I drop jewels and pack nines
I'm still the same homey from '89, so speak your mind
Now I'm on my grind, from sun down to sunshine
See you went blind for a minute, now I ain't got time
Catch me spit a line, I don't know, I gotta think about it
Gotta cut these vines 'fore these snakes'll try to penetrate me
Sing about (right), I'm takin' the whole cake
Now I'm push and be up out it, feed the whole Tri state




Now ain't that a damn shame, the way I spit game
I could talk my way out of some beef
And that'll buy me some time to run and get the piece
Then come back with the heat and bury you in the streets
Sweet with the gift of gab, when I lift the mag'
I put you in the right place, you Will & Grace fag
The ex' type spizz off, when it chase the Jag'
Somebody lace the bag, now there's dust in my dutch
Yo Dutch, roll up, wait a minute, hold up
These cats are frontin' the cut, let's open his stomach up
So what? I don't care if you don't like me, you don't excite me
I'll have vets murder you in broad daylight, g
Sheisty's your middle name, I bang you little lames
Rapid shots riddle your frame, your head piece hangs
Same shit but different day, now the pistol's aimed
At your heart, squeeze off then break you apart




They're the kind of niggas everybody knows (everybody knows)
They freak them bitches from head to toe (from head to toe, from head to toe)
They're the rolling stones, the Al Capones (watch it when we coming down)
They're the Romeos, they hit you then they gone, ooh, yeah






Reaching for the stars


Rockstar lifestyle, living it right now
There he go, getting it hype, now
All the noise, your boys is piped down
In the moment, living it right now
Chest out, here come the fight now
In the light, never the back down
Watch the evil, it lives in the background
Fame, been known to attract crowds


Take me to the stars (Got to feel like I'm out of this world)
Take me to the stars (Push it to the limit, feeling out of this world)


Only way to connect, is with convo
Show respect for what you borrow
Like the science of the cosmos
Paint Picassos for use and Cerado
Never settle is my motto
Small minds seem to put themselves in the bottle
Create a path you should follow
Positive thoughts, better tomorrows




Let's talk about, revenge, serve cold
Jealousy, it gets old
How could you want, what the next man have
You can't control, what you can't have
Don't lose your soul, just to get cash
You need some help, but you didn't ask
You're only as good, as what you did last
Heard he could flow, heard he could spit fast
Hold your head, don't get gassed
Good time lovings and some good laughs
Kicking your feet up, first class
Good kid, on a good path





 + (Tash Mahogany)
She's my number one gangsta chick (my starter) She's my number one starter chick
She's my number one drafted pick, she's my number one line on the hit
I only wanna see it (my starter) It's truly needed, When the ball drops...
Anything she say, you know I'm gonna do (my starter)
Watch out, watch out, when that ball drops...


You'se a starter, like Candace Parker
Take flight like Skywalker, might wolf it on ya father
Student Athlete, player of the week
G.P.A. 4.0 and her game's complete
Skintone buttercream, all defensive team
Dreamgirl like Jennifer Hudson, you're my Queen
To be, I'm ya King, keep ya under the wing
Together we can capture the ring
You the human highlight, body type, just right
Hairdo stay tight, go hard ball all night
All-star shine so bright
Hall of famer, about to take the game to new heights
You're my number one draft pick, McDonald classic
No look dunks to the basket
Yeah, yeah, that's mine, that's mine...




Blunt smoke, fifth hundred stroke
I'm going nuts, full clip, shoot up her fat lips
And round butt, catch Heat when I'm In Too Deep
The answer beeps, she take dives on the busiest streets
Whatever situation or the circumstances
Outdoor, indoor, she's taking the chances
Hotel, motel or Holiday Inn
Overlooking that bible, she continued to sin
Spread wide on the desk, paperwork all in a mess
While the ceiling fan blowing her dress
Ten minutes of jerking along with the slurping
Her skirt hid her talent until I raised the curtains
Showtime at the Apollo, she'll follow my lead
Then get on her knees, then swallow her pride
Strapped and ready to ride




Yeah, that's my down bitch
That's my down bitch, anything she do for her man
If it's lying on the stand, fish frying in the pan
She a Queen like Liz the third, wicked curves
On her word, stay still, rocking linens and furs
While she do it in the sack, jazz music in the back
Flat blew a nigga back, act two, I'm into that
Damn right, she the star of my team
When we stepped on the strip, baby girl, we the heart of the scene
Whether Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan or Queens
Staten Island, she styling, if not, she's not seen
Playboy status, every man's lust
She acting all shy, but she likes handcuffs


I'm the first on the court, first to hit the dance floor
The floss in this rap sport, what more can ya ask for?
Let ya glass pour, Wu-Tang is here now
All my Independent Women, time to let ya hair down
Bottles popping, everything is fair ground
Fresh legs, window shopping, can't help to stare it down
You'se a starter cuz I chose ya first
Baby, you'se a starter, where you throw that skirt
Lady, you'se a starter, where ya hold it down
Yeah, I'm Cold Blooded, then ya love my style
This is rush hour traffic, first one to merk off
It's like clockwork, first to get ya work off
I'm the workhorse, Killa Bee performer
Pro darter, starter, not a bench warmer, what?




You've learned how to kill
Every moved you've learned is trained to that end
Yet, we wish to preserve life
The first thing to learn, is that difference
Then you can start training with us, from the beginning



(Verse 1: U-God)
Yeah
Tired of all this shit god
Channel you wanna come out?
Niggas betta respect this shit
I see, I see the same ol' rap cats gettin real lame
Same ol' funny cats
Radio Cats
Dummy Squads
Get one gold record step in the party hard
Like Tyson with ten body guards
Quiet stormin, we still countin enourmous odds
One enter this shit, in a sence represent
Just the sun drenched the gods up
Kept his law start date March 5th ninteen nintey nine
Mighty Healthy, wealthy for fine
Braveheart, veins, respect mines
Before the war happened we connect to your glass spines
And as we bash heads, clash nines, who said you could use my lines?
Who said you could rock my Wu sings?
The golden eye chastisment
Supreme team shit
Spy versus spy shit
Small crimes comitted
Tryin it wit my shines on
Gimme mines
Suppost to be comin wit proper flows son
Over the hill, headed with thrill on elephants
Till the buffalo guns
The greatest of all times
This time, I'm not go'n say no names
If you not one of the same I suggest you

(chorus)
Stay in your lane
Stay in your lane
Stay off my stage, stay in your lane
If you ain't from the grain
If you ain't my main man like RZA
Stay in your lane
Stay in your lane

(Verse 2: U-God)
The run-away train double the sting
Me and Edith stay beneath us
Flip like Batman and Bruce Wayne
Don't take my kindness for weakness
36 peak shit
Sweetness, ride the bridges skim the bubbles real fridged
Don't get mad couse we lived it
As our dog we don't trouble you
Tell your bitch and your friends respect that "W" too
Y'all make me sick
Renegade chicks, strap a grenade to my dick
This shit is feather
Stuck in a high, but more callibre job
To rip your best in half
We arm wrestle you till you beg
Pop your legs in the pretzel
The one in the flames and came out the drain
I suggest that you

(chorus)
Stay in your lane
Stay in your lane
Stay off my stage, stay in your lane
If you ain't from the grain
If you ain't my main man like RZA
Stay in your lane
Stay in your lane

(Verse 3: U-God)
The rain of Spain falls mainly on the plane
Ready to bake this shit
Snake verse crane
Detrail me, hope I fell
I'm hot on your tail people
You can't be the light
I came to Earth first by a meteorite
Frog, analog non descript, I gently empty the clip
Crack the whip, rip you from your lips to your hips
Chip for some men off, you fake dreds
Action bitches about me and my black belt degree in rappin
I make a whole lot of shit happen
The moister peal, oyster vapors
Ember on papers
Still scalpin
Y'all piggy backin snakes
Jiggy rap
Shinin like 'Pac, a whole fuckin album
This time, through the flames of triumph
Through the flames of triumph
I ain't go'n play no games
I ain't go'n play no games but I suggest you

(chorus)
Stay in your lane
Stay in your lane
Stay in your lane
Stay off my stage, stay in your lane
If you ain't from the grain
If you ain't my main man like RZA
Stay in your lane
Stay in your lane
Stay in your lane
Mothafucka stay in your lane
You ain't from the grain
If you ain't my main man like RZA
Stay in your lane
Stay in your lane
Stay in your lane
Stay in your fuckin lane
Niggas
Bang bang




Put your hands up, it's a stick up, you heard?
Uh-huh, all my live niggas, friday..
Put your hands up, it's a stick up, you heard?


I'm the hood like weed and crack
Best believe I'm the hood and I ain't far from my gat
Was taught to hold it down, and never slack on my mack
Same niggas you give pounds, be those niggas that rat
The bullshit, you got a deal, momma told me react
I'm from a part of town, that's real, where you can't relax
Shots throwin', always somethin', get your head piece cracked
The block jumpin', stay pumpin', these buildings is where it's at
These buildings is where I stack, brought out the INF-Black
Rather get caught in the act, then caught dead in your back, so chill (chill)
If peace was an option, and still plottin'
Nobody's untouchable, keep your p's when it's coppin'
Please, when I'm cockin', or freeze and get boxed in
So many m.c.'s on they knees, now they plead when they coppin'
My live state rockin', fresh, and still grindin'
Time after time and my homies, I'm still ridin'


Ya'll haters coudln't ride with me
Couldn't get down like me, get high like me
Competition's like a robbery, it's easy to see
Yo, put your hands up, it's a stick up, you heard?


Go bang, when I'm jumpin' the gun
Have ya'll bitch ass niggas run
It go bang, that's the sound of the thang
That's the sound of the thang..


I ain't talkin' like I can't slip, or get clipped
But I'm on point like my outfit matchin' my kicks
I'm cockin' this fifth, faggot niggas all on my dick
With a heart full of fire, I ain't givin' an inch
Take my kindness for weakness, ain't life a bitch
Staten Isle's best secret'll run up in your shit
Like I ain't never been pinched, took a blow over some dough
I slap a hole in the 'fro for sniffin' my blow, it's real
Park Hill's where I'm from, where killas load guns
And take funds, huggin' the trigger
Shot pumps in your Hilfiger, or the block for this cheddar
Hold cracks in sweaters, next to floored counterfeiters
Yeah, I loved a lot of niggas, but lot of niggas I stop lovin'
It's me or them, so fuck 'em (fuck 'em) ...




I'm livin' proof, nigga, listen
More jewels than Q when he killed Bishop, play the roll or be the victim
Time's tickin', my hand's itchin', I'm hot in the kitchen
Any condition, I'm street, son, I'm plottin' the mission
Choppin' the raw, I'll break it off, through my addition
It's gonna be friction, I keep the half-sawed, it's real
Push my limit, catch an ass whippin', son, I ain't' missin'
Two tool for the club and a nine for the waistline
Get it all, it's fine, just like your bitch, can't wait to taste mine
Break spines for yards and I break the bassline
Hold it down with my squad, move hard as county lines, run that
I'm your car, wouldn't call it a crime
My rubber gripped chrome nine, keep ya'll hoes in line
Treat you like old pussy, cuz I'll fuck you when I want
Gut you out like a turkey and I'll stuff you a blunt, chump
Have you in emergency, for tryin' hum a stunt




Nigga run that...
Give up your chain and your watch, or the Glock'll go click clack
I ain't playin', what I'm sayin', throw these hollows in your six pack
Don't have me pop, don't move, nigga, I ain't try'nna hear that
Niggas know I won't hesitate to put your fuckin' shit back


Yeah, INF-Black, Hillside Scramblers, it




Muthafuckas, toast to that, nigga
Put your hands up, it's a stick up, you heard?




Oh yeah, coming through with my Shaolin crew
Two cent for a case, gimme St. Ide's brew
In the midst of broken bottles and crushed up cans
Methtical's in a jam, oh how dry I am


With St. Ides in my system
Crack another I'm blessed, let's go get the next one
And get over, the object is to stay sober
Lay on the sofa, better yet, dial my chauffeur


Call me the Wallabee Champ, sretched out, could never be son
Ricochet daily hit the deli for a cold one
Naturally blessed, yes, my rap is like a laser beam
That blows in the bushes, St. Ide's fill the canteen


Crack the bottle of the St. Ide's, sipping to those
Who don't realize that drinking ain't only to be drunk
You can't drive, keep my peoples alive
And if the Saint don't know you from a can of paint


It was hot on the spot so I jetted up the block
I saw Ak with an Ide's, I could tell by the dot
On the back he be building, not that charcoal filtered
Ice cold bottle tilted, to my cup he spilt it
Ahh St. Ides




Yo, rated x, smack you off the stage when I'm vexed
No sweat, I crack a cold case of Beck's
Guess whose back, the jack of all trades is next
The rap cuisine, I crack a raw egg and flex
I cave in your chest, this one came from the 'jects
Yeah, the cause and effect, make innocent blood pour
The streets is like the rap game, a daily tug of war
For rich or for poor, or death do us part, niggas come for test


Still grimey (grimey, grimey)
Still slimey (slimey, slimey)
Don't try me (try me, try me)
It's been ten long years, you can't untie me


Bring fire and Ruck let the heat pour
Niggas like Ruck 'Fuck you rhyming to this beat for?'
Listen, life is like a muthafuckin' seesaw
One minute you're hot, the next, yo Where's Rock?
None of your biz, fuck around, and run in your crib
Wife like 'He ain't here', throw some to your wiz
Niggas running up on me, til the tre' pound click
Talking 'bout 'Ruck, let's battle' on some 8 Mile shit
I'm like; nigga, my name ain't B. Rabbit
It's Sean Price, Big Ruckus from busting these ratchets
Call me gay basher, for fucking up these faggots
Ya'll niggas ain't nothing, stop fronting, stay passive
Yo, pass the dutch, on the left hand side
Sean gone til November, stole Wyclef's ride
Bob Backlund, car jacking, New Jersey driving
Ya'll niggas ain't think about rapping, til you hear me rhyming, oh




I keeps it real in the field, Navy feel on the drill
Never stingy with my bills, plenty gravy I spilled
Recorded in the history of rap, two inch reels
Seven to ten mills, eleven to twenty hills
Rest in peace to my brother Half-A-Mil
Unnecessary blood spilt, another thug killed
Move with the mass appeal, the blast still
For the Cash Money Click, No Limits and no thrills
Mad cuz your ho, feeling P. Sunzini, give you
As sweet as a kiwi, face it, you not me, nigga
Ladi dadi, the Gods like to party
We don't cause trouble, but we can make you a body
Ladi dadi, the Sunn likes to party
I don't cause trouble, but I will make you a body
Flowin' high in the Mazarati, two with my ninjas beside me
Lively, floating on some Ducatti's
With two gellati's, two hotties, we never sloppy
Jewelry rocky, Spanish pieces, they call me papi
Clear fire Bacardi, sobered up like Gotti
Rest in peace to my dog, Shotti, Shotti




On the corner ready to bo', holding my nuts
Standing by my building looking at myself in the truck
My reflections... (still grimey)
Oscar the Grouch's worms (still slimey)
I got a jones for Miss Piggy's ham hiney
I can be a bum in the slums, and slam shiny
On every corner, I'm grams, you can find me
The boss of the burners, I fire shots if your nine speak
This is true Manchu, and who you, fams too?
Better have they face in the game, like the Blue Man Group
I heard you smell me, I make it funky
Rock hard and kick ass like, I hate you donkeys
My oatmeal lumpy like Johnson's Bumpy, Harlem humpty
Hungry wolves, pain's hummer, harbor hungry
Dumpty, blazing trees, now leave an O.E. present
Know why the hood feel me, like police presence






It's the sasquath, Jackpot
The roach killer, that's what we do
You know what it is, you little crawly creepy bastards


We ain't tripping, read the sentence
The Gods got it locked like up on Main in San Quentin
You drinking muscle milk, homey, you gon' get killed
Walking round like Deebo, cuz you slight built
It's a dirty job, we get it popping hard
We turn this whole shit slamming to the Mardi Gras
And ain't nobody mad, it just we got it bad
Like a body being slumped when you hail a cab
Vaccum packed, concealed, no room for breath
I grip a mic, it's Five Fingers of Death
So, stomp the roach, stomp the roach, you know?
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, you know?
When I slip on, the grip-on, no clip on
And on the O'Jay's like Christopher Pawns
And eat with the beast, in the valley of death
Walk on the right, but I shoot with the left
Stomp out a roach with the d-Con breath
All you little rat bastards, I stomp you to death
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, you know
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, yo


Four more seconds 'fore the bomb come on
Roach killer, you scatter when the lights come on
You can run on, and start ducking and dodging
I pluck you, crush you right between the margin
I'm the drill sergeant, I'm the boric acid
The black flag nigga, the bio hazard
The econimist of the bio standard
And he sprayed the myst on them fly's that landed
And I can be obvious or I can be candid, but
I'm shaking roaches off my shoes and socks
Then I, pluck roaches out my Fruit Loop box
Then I, tell my girl to change all the locks
Then I, throw my finger at the hip hop cops
Then I, put on my Timbs, then I stomp the block
Cuz I, stomp the roach, stomp the roach, you know?
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, you know?
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, you know
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach


They known to leech off people for, years and years
They cause trouble by, staying up in, niggas ears
They set up shops in apartments in projects
Bold enough to roll up on, any object
Grabbing on my gear til they pull the label off
They fight for the crumbs that's on my table cloth
They keep they antennas up, the signals strong
They got the neighborhood bugged, that's how they survived so long
Immune to 'combats' and, household 'raids'
Like informants that's living off, government aid
We leave roaches where the remain and trash lays
Incinerate it, they spend they last days in ashtrays
Ignored by the dogs, but, chased by the cat
Like a sneaky ass rat that got caught in the trap
A small time nigga, who didn't have a clue
It take a million of ya'll just to fill up my shoe
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, yeah
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, uh-huh
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, yeah
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, uh-huh
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, you know
Stomp the roach, stomp the roach, you know


How long till you get me off the hook? For old time's sake
I can't do it, Sally
Don't ever take sides with anyone, against the family again ever




I know you think you struggling
And everything looks bad
Over the hug, you can't get
And that just makes you mad
Can't trust the man beside you
And got no real true friends
Keep waiting on the day
When all your drama's gonna end


Stop, look and listen
Life, is a blessing
Stop, all your stressing
You'll, find what's missing
Just carry on, just carry on, just carry on


Life's so short, but I'm suppose to do it
Sit back, relax and enjoy the view
Smell the fresh air, the morning dew
Let the sunshine come beaming through
Broken rules, beneath the crimes
We all god's creatures, the streets is mine
Forget your stress, release your mind
Take all your worries, leave 'em all behind
Now, peep my rhyme and you see my cause
We all got problems, we all got flaws
We all got heartaches, we all got sores
Just make sure you take care of you and yours




I got jewels for the mind, more fruit to eat
You are exceptional, you are unique
You are truly special, to be on earth
You are really blessed, it can be more worse
Now feel my hurt, hear my lions roar
Reach for your dreams and try to soar
Push through the door, the lord's thy sheppard
Lean on the shoulders, when times is hectic
People got problems, try to accept it
No food to eat, baby need pampers
People in the world need cures for cancer
I got questions, I need answers




This one right here, I compose this lyric
For your self esteem, to up lift your spirit
Take my kindness for weakness, and you try to smear it
All you dumb, deaf and blinds, ain't trynna to hear it
It's the jealousy, envy, lust and greed
Care less for what ya want, or more of what you need
And it's hard to believe and have faith in people
When you stuck in the battle over good and evil




Yo, don't worry ya head, sweetheart
Everything is gonna work out fine
If it was meant for you to have it
You'll have it, don't give up ya dreams, never
Ever, ever, give up ya dreams, keep on pushing




Color ain't got no struggle... color..


Move, grind, move, grind
Move, grind, move, grind


Yo, yo, it's hard to smile, cuz life's so for real
It's funny what people do just to get a mill
Some kill, rob, steal, sell crushed pills
Multimillion dollar deals, generatin' hills
But I got skills, there no need for violence
How that nigga stay hungry with degrees in science
Yeah, he needs a challenge, you'se an A-Class Pilot
The boy so vibrant, he walk like a tyrant
His mind's in the garbage, his spine is heartless
He's a one mind pirate, who gets his regardless
With felony charges, greedy coke-nosed clients
His nose is numb and he didn't read the fineprint
Accounts on minus, with a block of stress
And he can't close his eyelids cuz it don't care less
Yeah, they died on they blinders, he got mouths to feed
So he grieves over liquor, that his spouse might leave
And it leads him sicker, his house ain't been cleaned in a week
He can't sleep cuz his problem's gettin' deep, cuz


Struggle ain't got no color, kid
Color ain't got no color
Now, color ain't got no struggle, kid
Struggle ain't got no color
Now growin' up, it's a wild jungle, kid
Color ain't got no struggle
Same block, same clubs, same money, same drugs
Struggle ain't got no color


I can't sleep around heat, roaches and dust mites
In the winter time it's cold enough, nigga, to bust pipes
I'm like, Jesus Christ, yo, my socks is black
I'm hoodied up in the halls with the stocking cap
Rockin' forth and back, draggin' a huge cannon
Duckin' the law, I'm the last man standing
Strong armin' the store, when the line is drawn
With a fifty pound vest on, that strike your dawn
It's like, I'm a pawn, takin' orders from the side
From the root to the fruit, I'm a Freedom Fighter
Police in hot pursuit, move beneath the fire
Peel out in tires, when I burn these streets
These knockaround guys, never turn they cheeks
We're all I see, my contract's is wack
Baby mamma huntin' for cash, get off my back
Take out the trash, put some food on the shelf
I don't trust women, son, I can't trust myself
Fuck them hoes, cuz, I'm just movin' for delf


Things never change, we all the same
We bleed the same blood (blood)
Yeah, I've seen joy, love, hate and pain
I never gave up (up)




Yo, I come from the gutter, bad blood and slum
Where niggas scarred for life, and they die for crumb
Where young worship the gun, smoke blunts for fun
It's the same old song, one minute it's calm
Then shots ring out like it's Vietnam
And you see it's wrong, when you're forced to retire
My single's almost gone, caught in the crossfire
That's why I'm high wired, Lord, forgive me
I broke down and cried, when he lost his kidney
With his baby sitter Shi-Shi, two years old
He laid on the floor, bullet holes in his clothes
I was miles away, yeah, away on tour
When I received the call, in the phone, I hang up
I was mad at the world, and grabbed the banger
Wrecked the hotel, released the anger
You supposed to keep my child away from danger
First we were friends, now we strangers
He lost a lot of blood, but didn't show no fear
In I.C.U., in intensive care
And I praise the Lord, that my son is still here, but






Get 'em...
Supa freak, freak, freak, freak, freak
Freak, freak, freak, freak


So you wanna be the man with the gun in your hand
The Son of Sam, expand shells, invades where you dwell
The smell of rigger mortis, corpses, enforces
That they become victim to homicide resources
Minor league bosses, petty cash crimies
Snatch your dime piece, leak where my mind speaks
Short circuit the mini time piece, pretty nine squeak
The echo travels the city night streets


Yeah, hit-hit new release, guaranteed to hit the streets
Rhyme-rhyme all the time, never ever drop a dime
Stop-stop doin' crime, first one to pop the nine
Rave that I throw the shine, up your back then your spine
Bad-bad, super bad, always first, never last
Swift-swift, swifter blast, hit 'em with the iron fast
Throw 'em in a body cast, sweat burnin' in the gas
Set fire to the ash, smoked in his liver, grass


Dirty, grimey, low down, shiesty
Freaky, feisty, hood rat from the hood
(Supa freak, freak, freak, freak, freak
Freak, freak, freak, freak)


Snap screen shots of the wild life chronicles
Head spin similar to theme park roller coasters
The solo holster straps, laser beam Glocks
Steamin' hot, blow your snot box, the hottest psyche particles
Barbecue, flame boiled crooks, soap by the hooks
Splash brain from the wild frame notebooks
Son, you so shook, I murder your gimmick
Take you to the climb, back to drop, vertical limit


Yeah, ball playin' girl lane, on the mic I'm rhyme sprayin'
M.C. rock viciously, satisfaction guaranteed
Or you get your money back, leave your girl, that's a wrap
Hit spike like a bat, heel toe, now I tap
Second round, second left, in your town, check it, check
Cock the beretta back, where my money at?
Smack off your funny hat, always come in super jive
Lamp in the honey hive, man on the ziggy side




Pop headphones, glide over metro domes, ride, enter the zone
Open wide, head blown, hell fire, lead bone
Self fly spread, chrome you're live by a man's dome
Divine burns your skin tone, high with the trench stone
Blood money leakin' out my pockets, complex, unidentified flyin' objects
Comin' at you with 3D, scratch it with CD's
That take a sharp head bangers, state of the art


Yo, dip to the dot, dot to the dip
Make the fly girls wanna turn your hips
Raps on the juggle, double up quick
Bullets rip, I burn the whole clip
Cause the long eyelids point to your lips
To the walls I stick, with my Spiderman grip
Fully action pump grip, jump swift
Blow you the bitch, shorty, use and you miss






You won't, you won't, you won't slick
Fly shit, let a supa nigga rip
You want, you want, the music
Them hits, let a supa nigga rip
Can I, can I, can I live
Can I live, let a supa nigga rip
Them hits, you make, you ain't shit
Stop trick, let a supa nigga rip


My sideburns resemble supa fly O'Neal
Dust off the rocks, pop the bluesteele
Shoot for thrills, drive the big wheels
My waterbeds, wavy ladies, tell me how it feels
There he go, in came the wind
The sudden fragrance, was like Angel for men
Out the gold carriage, the doo rags chief
When you see him go, rose peddles on his feet
The man you can trust, the man with thrust
Every jam I bust, is somethin' fan-tabulous
These scandalous streets, the way that I spill this
Make cold hearted people bump, triggermen feel this




I sit back like the Mack, sip my yak
Watch the dough stack, go explosive on the track
Heavy dosage, react blinded, stay on some hungry
The money don't make the man, the man make the money
Poison, bad men, hoes and all the honeys
Noise in the attic, boy, you can't run from me
The gun runner, funky drummer, number one stunner
Breeze through in the hummer, crush a G.Q. cover
It's prime-time, hit the mic like James Brown and hover
The same time I smother, bring down the thunder
The fighter, the lover, understand my pen
We rep on record and we stand like men
Yes I stand like ten, friends with boulder ends
Fresh out the pen, drop cars from Motor Trend
Yes it's him, swinger, rings on every finger
Ladies in the hallway sayin' "Sing for me singer", it's




It's 2002 and my, gun is a laser
My, mind is my castle and my, tongue is a razor
Renegade favor hollow, fast on the phase
Trailblazin' kids still, fast with his blades
Leather, recliner seats, designer shades
Zero to ninety, dippin' down the highways
Yellin' out the window, I should of did it my way
A Friday high day, cape in the wind
The ex-gun slinger's done, came through again
The missin' link consist of sting, see me with dime pieces
Three at a time pleaser, Remy red lime squeezer
Fine creature, nice to meet you Golden
That super bad brother, that muthafucka holdin'
You heard, now





(repeating in background: "rock, the body body -- rock the body body"


Dino the dart specialist
Knahmean?
Golden Arms, yo
Meth-Tical, John John do your thing thing
What? Check it


The all eye seein, heavenly divine
The truth brings out, the temper in my spine
A Hill sound again, feelin symptoms that bit me
I feel for you victims, with everything up in me (uh-huh)
A head ringa, stuffed in sidewalls of frenzy
Back the fuck up, cause I'm stimmi off the Remi
A semi bloodshot eye, donkey dick of nuts
Every cut, I split and try and felt the guts (what?)
Nigga what, earthquakin speech, woofer hissin
The razor faced victims, WHEW, that's what kissed em
Appropriate precaution, surroundin, certain it curtains
I'm dumbfounded, I'm poundin, the pavement
For mental enslavement, I'm cravin, a misbehavin savior
America the grave for gun wavers (what?)
The wave runners, what the blood seed again
Make you wonder, about the thunder underneath the skin (hmm)
The sapphire rhymes slap fire out your minds
With right timin, bite with vampire rhymes


Hmm, I spy, with my crooked eye
Full metal street soldiers, born to die
Put em up yeah fuck yeah, when it's Hammertime
Niggas can't be touched here, the true and livin
Night vision unseen, like Gene
When I hack men The Unforgiven, left in prison
In the Wu-Tang dirty dungeon, now you succumbin
To my twelve part dirty dozens, flabbergasted
By tracks that be True Mastered, opposites attract
Beef plus they ass backwards, stick yourself
Til I'm felt, this ass whoopin, is bein dealt
Like hot beans-and-butter nigga, I got the belt
What the deal huh? Swing low, sweet chariot
I walk the Underground Railroad, with Harriett
Just a slave to the rhythm - victims I'm like alien
About to put that shit up in em, I Can't Live
Without My Radio, a 100 Miles and Runnin
T2 Judgment day comin, nobody's safe
When I reminisce about Case, still hit the staircase
When the coppers give chase, I give em finger
The only hip-hop singer, to tell America
To kiss his Killer Bee stinger, nothin can save ya
From this major misbehavior, heavy hands
Layin corners in the elevator, guard your grill


I speculate, get my darts straight, don't exaggerate
Dictate, do it with the Papermate, set the plate
Set the bait, checkmate, fuckin with cha mental state
Double take, meditate, earthquake, VGL contemplate
Big boys integrate; catch you at the sess skate
Army tank, high rank, got the bank
Got the shank talk the talk walk the walk from New York
To Up North to downstate to L.A., to all day
To cliches to instant replays, to all the DJ's
To BJ's in the PJ's, equality days
With money like legs I plant eggs, Pele roundhead
The dog bred, snakes runnin from red, catch dead
Raekwon is on, take your uniform, we perform
Shit like gangs in Now Born, check for new Don
Fuck a Yukon, you been warned, we the realest
We never were conned, duffed out and knowledge born

("Rock, the body body - rock the body body") - repeat til fade




Yo, Yo Yo Yo
Yall know me, I got the sick talk
Other MCs is phony, They just a rip off
Boulders on my shoulders daily, Gotta chip on
Hand on my steel for real, Get my grip on
Exercise daily baby, Get my dip on
Big bone niggas see me, On the flip phone
Hydro home grown stone, In my slip ons
Write hood songs with them heavyweight bosses
Honey with the hips put her lips on my sausage
Paint a portrait, Then I pray at the alter
Then I shake the ground, I'mma pound your recorder
Every time I slaughter, Bring back the coast
The raw un-cut, Fuck the lactose
I don't slack off, No, He not a rookie
It's fucked up what Schwarzenegger did to Tookie
Off to a slow start, Look how long it took me


Smack you in your face, Knuckle you, jook you, buck at you
Theres so many different ways I could snuff you, Who the fuck are you?
We all bleed, Flesh is soft, When a sharp blade hits
To say this, Rep it, I'm decrepit, Lets see ??? this(Bitch)
Necro cuts clits, off with scissors
I fuck tits with my dick, Scorin like Fabio Frizzy
Music in gore flicks, I'm rippin your chain
Stick an ice pick in your brain, My shit is insane
The brutal is verbal murder, Sever cerebrums like a sledge hammer
Smash in your face, You heard it, I meant it, I mean it
Demented, Obscene, Should invent to get your feet cemented in blocks
And dropped over a bridge, Until your spleens fermented
Danglin a custom Necro chain, In front of a bitch's face
Hypnotizin, I'm makin her give me brain
Treat bitches like the piece of shits that they are, (Yo)
You'll wind up deceased bitch, If you don't pull them tits out your bra


I know your repetiteur, Psycho Logic on the disk
My heart piece is poundin, I'm mobbin with the lynch
We like Batman and Robin, We hopin off the bench
My hand piece is throbbin, To bang 'em with the wrench
I burn 'em to a crisp, When I turn into the Grinch
Cool down your jet baby, Wet 'em till he's drenched
If it don't make dollars, It don't make sense
If it don't politic, We don't break bread
The underground flava, Will wig heads
Yeah U-God and Necro, The eagles is screamin
Silver back gorillas, In bulletproof BMs
Get the fuck outta dodge, Let's blow this mausoleum


I got a big posse of kids that will dead you for me
I earnt that through respect, Loyalty, And integrity
Street royalty, Brooklyn and Staten will fuck you up
Psycho Logical Wu-Tang, Necro and U-God in the cut
My catalog is crills, The death funk is robust
I keep my shit dirty like bums, And Dunkin' Donuts
Verse after verse, We don't bother with a chorus
We're gonna make a million, And have your father workin for us



 + (Raekwon)
On the firing line... lock, one round load
Ready on the right? Ready on the left?
Ready on the firing line? Watch for ya targets
(Yeah, yeah, yeah...) pay attention


Welcome to the fish fry where niggas get burnt to a crisp
Jump out the pot, "Yeah yo I got this"
Long armor, construction's on, I'm pro-drama
Catch me in the wildest beefs, I bring bombers
Bearded like Talibans, booted, my black ninjas
'll come through, tuxedos on with the gold llamas
Priceless like emeralds, check out the ski mask
King Tut's nephew gave it to me for three bags
Of heron, Don Baron, sniff a bag of blow
Fifth out, runnin' up in Saks with the ill army
Shake feds, play dead, yo check out what Rae said
Lay on ya hands, let the Branson break bread
High energy, all my niggas a kin to me
Regardless how it go down I still get ten a ki
Beware of my enemies, y'all remember me
Nikes with the low goose on and I've been a beast
Wilding in my headphones, red in my stones
Good ganja out, if I die fill up my headstones
With water, dough, acid and gold classics
All my niggas who pump, the spirit'll jump out and grab shit
Max with the laser on 'em, staircase caskets (caskets)
Broke bugged thugs in the hallway maxing (maxing)

 + (movie sample)
Still them 1-6-Ooh niggas, straight up (whoa, hold up, hold up)


The nozzle aim rip through ya frame for pocket change
Fiend for the Rush Hour 4 then pop a vein
Thousand dollar corks pop, pause or get off top
Used to be a general, just lost your spot
Animal House, two grand'll handle ya mouth
Beast mode with the G-Code cancel 'em out
Son, I've seen Hell, fell into the palms of Satan arms
Don that I am made 'em bow in the face of God
Graveyard Shifting, different day, the same thing
The name ring then the chain swing and dames cling
Money green, Maury kicks, whips and new fitteds
(It was all a dream) Advocated by the few who do live it
Bloomberg make a nigga cop the Mausberg
Shorty ain't a shorty, he a shooter like Wahlberg
Old man told me, "Don't be blind to deception
Only strive for perfection homey, ya mind is a weapon"


Relax, you got ya muscles tight, relax
Word... Word...

 + (U-God)
First we told y'all niggas, then we showed y'all niggas, huh?
(We gon' take it back with this)
By the time you get a show, we've been all around the globe, huh?
(We gon' take it back with this)
Before you even had a name, you was screaming "Wu-Tang"
(We gon' take it back with this)
When we was running on the block, you was under ya pops, remember
(We gon' take it back with this... let's go)


Armor truck money, Shazam bangles, play the throne like
Julius Caesar, gorilla mob, slash, Killah's gaurd
Fake passports and visas, all of my goons
They be carrying spoons because boom he had a massive seizure
Hot chocolate lovers, guns is published
Detroit bitches out of town be dying to fuck us
This is real talk, shank lullabyes
Ben Franks, we like Jet Blue we stay hella high
Curl on the dumbell L, we can't even S-P-E-L-L
MTV or TRL's
Supreme novelists, we rank superior, guarding the post
Down low in the 'jects, got it locked in ya area
Ain't tryna hurry up
We like rebel niggas powdered up wilding in the streets of Liberia
No matter the crime, I'm beating the case
If I'm a wrong, a chair hit a judge right in his face
Shitting shanks out, come to court dates
Mittens on shines with blood Wally's that's the color of wine


Talk to me, my criminal mystique
Kick back the boards, six thousand a week
Pay homage, what the don beat, you're a minor threat
I see ya sweat roll down ya cheek
And ya soft and sweet, ya talk is pork
Get murdered in New York when I enforce the heat
And the cost ain't cheap, my advice is priceless
Bring back the life that ya thought was lifeless
The way of the gun, son, who the nicest?
S.K., no stun gun, smooth devices
Time crisis, I played the game, low lifers
In a brawl, ripped the phones out the walls in Rikers
Vipers in the infirmary rooms with slicers
Shiesters with hate in their blood might bite ya
Fuck that bitch if yo wife don't write ya
Cancel her, buy another one just like her
Pipers in the bucket of ice taste righteous
Today's mathematics when we build in cyphers
The baby automatic kill like Air Force strikers
I'm still Asiatic when I spill the hypeness


The dark, and this place will come here
That's right!






Time to strongarm this shit
This how we gon' do, dead arm this man, knowhatimsayin?
From the root to the fruit, twenty-one gun salute this shit
Uptown, Downtown, New York, down South
L.A., that's how we gon' do it, Hillside, nigga, all day


Meet me at the pop off, INF on the block
Hillside, get your rocks off, take it to the top
Got the whole world hatin', can't take me in the drop
Can't take it how I'm cakin' it, catch me in the spot
And you might see a veteran stance, but you'll never see a veteran dance
But you might catch me bangin' in the twat
She ain't got G, she ain't untangling my knot
In my baratone throw, here, bangin' out the box
Clubs to cell blocks, here tangle with an ox
Got gorillas in the mist, all my niggas arm with lead
So we gotta watch the killas on the strip
You already had a chance, try to kill us with a clip
One slug hit my lung, you could feel it when I spit
I'm a Hillside Scrambler, the widest in the click
Watch Ugodz-Illa set fire to this shit


As the music gets louder at the top of the hour
It's time to devour, cuz I'm hungry for power
I rise the towers, I'll retire your mans
And it never backfires when I devise a plan
I sprinkle money showers, I'm suppose to think big
All you coward ass niggas don't want me to live
Up the ladder of success, I won't forgive
Ya'll tight ass niggas, ya'll greedy ass pigs, nigga
Last bids, better tie it, the CREAM
I got here, hard work, plus dreams of steam
I'm a mean machine, eat Lean Cuisine
Similar to Steve McQueen on silver screen
I'm suppose to redeem, see my Sprewells twirl
I want a penthouse view, plus windows to the world
And, diamonds and pearls, and hardwood floors
An Italian Job, catch a big money score
At the tip of the iceberg, top of the mountain
Nigga, sky's the limit, when money I'm countin'
I want water and waves sprayin' out my fountain
Nigga, I can it with him, or I can do without him, bitch


Take it to the top (we ball 'til we fall, let the champagne pop, nigga)
Take it to the top (every hood, every block, know we got this shit locked
Nigga)
Take it to the top (Uptown niggas, Downtown niggas, get it poppin', baby)
Take it to the top (Niggas get your front on, bitches get your stunt on, come
On!)


It's the silent mover, analyst, sharpshooter
I parachute in your hood, ride off on a scooter
Smookin' buddha with two nines, I'm still rockin' Puma's
Heard it first on grapevine, my rhymes ill manauvers
On jake, we call 'em one time, escape the street crime
Drapped in black hoodies, Timbs and gold shines
Poppin' that champagne, get high like jet lines
Glide and break spines, make ya'll respect mine
I grind from nine to five, rely on the iron nine
INF-Black, I'm doin' fine, so far from hittin' prime
Rippin' right through your flesh, these bitches they wantin' sex
I take you to the top, and cut you off at the neck
Oh you the boss? You ain't a threat
Who cares of what you did, who cares of what you rep
I sidestep ya'll faggots, leave your food in a mess
Got ladies that play it cool and keep the tool in they dress
Ride with me... Hillside, uh




I've done started at the bottom, I deserve the tippy
Ya'll niggas got some nerve to try to forget me
Man, is he, or isn't he, the greatest who done it?
With sixteen bars that run concurrent
Who wanna serve the warrant? Ya'll ain't got nothin' for him
How you gonna score points, on the after Mike Jordan
Won't happen, stay scrappin', I can see what you lackin'
Hillside, rep Staten, see my wolves, still packin'
I ain't actin', unless they sold out the box office
Or Spike Lee steps to me with better offers
Tune in, play it again, Q, fuck me? Fuck you
That's how I'm supposed to do
We'll go eye for eye, we'll go tooth for tooth
Who the fuck wastes they money to put you in the booth?
You ain't the truth, you more like an L-I-E
Let it be known, I meet you at the T-O-P, nigga


Enter the stage, I hell raise
With the force of double barrel 12 gauge
Pump shotgun, dump hot ones
Fireballs flamin' out the mouth, lockin' your lungs
Let me explain what the pain is about
Oscar the Grouch, out the trashcan, Dead Presidents style
Twin pounds in my hands, write my measurements down, clown
I bang in the name of my son, exchange flames til I'm done
The clip's empty and I'm the remainding one
Anger from the Slums, soak up liquor with a sponge liver
Your flow of blood is leakin' worse than a running river
Silver spines worse than Cabin Fever
Play the receiver, of a stabbing meat clever in your abdomen
All that from steppin' on my sneaker
The beat box jam, causes me to murder you with my intellect
Kill for respect, plus work hard for the power
Then I carve Loose Links inside the heart of a coward

Blood money mercenaries, think you can muscle Wu?
It's a foot race, who can out-hustle who?
Hip hop junkie flunky, monkey see, monkey do
Great minds connect like mobster rings
Sit back, let me do my, Sinatra thing
I'm in the Hip Hop Hall of Fame, on the wall is the plaques
Old ball and chain, I named her Madam X
She love big cannons, sex unprotected
You better respect it, kid, we 'bout to set trip
You get ya neck ripped, eyeballs are scoping
I don't sell crack, I sell dopium
Catch him at the podium, nah, he moving too fast
Professor X, behind the bulletproof glass
You need a Wu pass, a bag of that high
Easy with the flicks, baby, I'm camera shy

Get that money, God, keep your sword sharp (1-2-3-4)


We might have to 8 Diagram one of y'all MC's
We grind everyday and we hustle for cheese
Got our face on the front of CD's, we off the hook
W.T.C. y'all soft and shook
Y'all not built like the Cuban Linx Clan that get CREAM
And back heads down every time we sing
Give us a hundred grand for a show, let us rock
For more money, more chicks, more private stock


They call me Streetlife, slap the taste
Out ya mug, know ya place, you ain't thug, fix ya face
Throw a slug, catch a case
Meanwhile, beat trial, back on that cash cow
Getting CREAM, however, a street brother know how
Point blank, I'm pulling rank, calling shot, I got bank
Pass the rock, my hand's hot, hit 'em with the showshotter
Peace to my ala mater, Wu-Tang block scholars
Never settle for less, promoters pay us top dollar

The Clan'll talk, Calabama niggas all'll quit
Talking that short dick shit, we was s'posed to be cool
Only the clue's on the other end of the stick
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Over-crowded police blood bamboo bimbo
Chickenhead skeezer crackrock hoodrat
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Barney here is down to a feeding dreadlock
Armpit like two Buckwheat's in a headlock
Macy Gray's hair between your leg lock
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Ya mother's so cross-eyed, when she cry tears roll down her back
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
 This shit is strong, god damn, what you got in there?
Over-crowded police blood bamboo bimbo
Chickenhead skeezer crackhead hoodrat
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Ya mother's so cross-eyed, when she cry tears roll down her back
Calabama niggas all'll quit
Talking that short dick shit
Speak up, no loud speaker but I'm speaking loud
Venacular ass kicking, truth got there in crowd
Shit, they call me the lethal lip
The linguistic, full metal jacket of venacular ballistic
Shooting out at the mouth without Chap or Blistec
Here's a mothafucka, I didn't flunk diaper rash
I'm verbally toxic, metal-piercing, forked, hollow point tongue
Dum dum, pow, shot from gattling gums
Hooked on phonics, packing a vicious vocabulary
Malicious, with malice and mayhem
Fuck a dictionary, give me the mic and I'll slay
Them and literally poetic symptoms
Pissing me the fuck off, missing me with that shit
I stick a venacular foot so far up in ya ass
You won't be able to pass verbal gas
So far in ya ass that one of my knees will rise so far above ya head
And you drown of a poetic ass kicking
Leaving lyrical lacerations on your lungs, from a verbal hangnail
That hung on my big toe, as I flow upward
Kicking yo on ya eardrum, you wanna hear some?
Tap dance on ya tonsils, leaving kiwi shoe polish on ya breath
Cavity in ya best rhyme, and I'm the access on the rest
Call me the proverbial verbal menacing dentist
With the drill, I got lyrical skills
I could perform oral root canals
It's unwise to fuck with me
Kick ya wisdom teeth down ya throat
Leaving you to choke
On where it hurts, unspoken vocals
Tying down ya vocal cord and windpipe tight
With toe jamming and ya mothafucking hemmoroids
Fuck the dumb shit...




(Tell me... tell me...)
What would you do? Hillside Scramblers
Loose links, what would you?
Uh, check it, yo, yo, yo


I'm down for the get down, down wanna spit rounds
He started the beef, now, wanna split town
With the mark of the beast, thinkin' you the shit now
Four pound whippin' the flesh, better sit it down
Get it clown? You done started something
I put it down, and you just started hustlin'
Gettin' thirty off of a bundle, you project nothing
You'll get linked in a rumble, you project frontin'
Catch beef in the J's, it's project dumping
Test your heat when it blaze, better target something
Even my dick iced out, I be hard at fucking
Niggas need to stop biting and try to market something
Niggas need to start writing, your bark ain't nothing
Your tracks ain't hot, and your back don't function
Got the rap game locked, the crack game dumping
Got the crime scene hot, the club scene thumping, what?


Tell me: what would you do?
If you was in my shoes and the nigga had the drop
Would you shoot first? Or get shot?
Or lift the earth from under his feet and make his boots rock
Tell me..


I can't stand it, people try to judge me
Especially the ones that said they love me, try to take me for granted
I been stranded with a mental block, sippin' expensive shots is hot
I could kiss the man who invented the Glock
The thermometer pops burger, I stay on cock
So whenever my dogs call me, I'll be there, the end of story
Surrenders gory, close the book after the final chapter
Gradual bullets that travel faster than yacht masters
Hot ratchets that'll spin you, like a spinning top backwards
Cut your cabbage and turn it into coleslaw
I'm so raw, that my mom should of middle named me Diesel
These lethal bars perfected, can't be injected by needles
Breeding eagles out of Park Hill's hell hole
Where souls get sucked up, and shots turn your bones to Jell-o
Mellow tones with a stealth blow, under the bell's a four-four
The impact will crack an elephant's skull




I'm like the hallways you walk through, smokin' a blunt with a brew
The staircase you piss on, gettin' head on the roof
Ride down my elevator, you get punched in the tooth
My alligators hang loose from the front to the phone booth
I'm the concrete, the gates, the bars, gunnin' my goof
I'm the drugs, the money, the booze, and every rules
Fuckin' Betty who? Niggas is petty, can get it to
Watch your mouth nigga, watch me, watch you
Like a movie, thought it was cool, how you wanted to do me
See me live with the snakes and get rid of them rats
I'm the fire in the lake, I burn faster than a match
But longer in a forest, at the speed of a mach
Spittin' out, bangin' off ground, I'm tearin' it down
There's never no fear in me, and they tellin' what's in me now
I've done tasted the dust, washed my face with the mud
Off with these clowns, my shoes is only made from my blood






Wu-Tang... yeah (what up son) you know
It's back to that good ol' thing again, you know?
(Pass that, pass that, man) Word up, we do this tremendously
(It's on, Rae) word up from staircase to stage
Yeah... (yo who that?) You know what it is
(Oh shit... that's the Wu niggas man) aiyo


From out the air space, I'm rockin' leather pants in the tenth grade
My pen blaze, now we in the wind gate, killin' haze
Put this shit back in order, do it like the crack days
Stack up, you little niggas back up, your raps suck
I demolish a maggot, faggot lines, nigga, you'se a savage
But don't never compare me to your wack times
I'll smash your hood up, yeah, anybody you call
I straight mash out, for cash nigga, put up
The Embassy's calling, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
Enemies is falling, y'all niggas ain't good enough
Now acknowledge the strength, we stand like buildings
In the city, raise that rent up, y'all niggas gonna give me, baby
Yeah, what, fucker, we stomp niggas out like XUV's
Then fuck ya girl in the but-ut
Nine rap playboys, see me in the Playboy Mansion
With the playboys on, I play rid-ough


Nigga, we glide when we ride, don't choke when we smoke
Disrespect fam, yo ass gon' get smoked
We got real money, seven figure deal money
I'm in the Samuel Jackson, Time to Kill money


Yeah, we got them anthems, we handsome and raw
All day, cops harass, but we laugh at the law
And a fiend got my stash, I blast through your door
I caught her with the four, his dame was frozen
She loves sniffing coke til her veins is bulging
You punk motherfucker, your ribs is frail
I've been eating calamari, getting big in jail


Nigga, we glide when we ride, don't choke when we smoke


I got that sidedish super today, eye candy
With the sweetest love, one bite, your tooth'll decay
I'm moving units like I'm moving the yae, and like they say
In this business, you either in it, bitch, or you in the way
Sky's the limit, I ain't come here to play, or come to shit where I lay
Who in that six blunt, clipping his tray
Sippin' some Ice Water, dipping with Rae
Tipping these tricks, dripping for pay
And knowing half them bitches is gay
T.M.I. blowing tree in sky, we on the job
So be abvised, that wack niggas, needing apply
S.I., represent til we die, this track is pitching to fry
Enter the Dragon, I be spitting that fire
Keep ya balls off, so calling you dogs off
Cuz word to these jeans, hanging off of my ass, I never fall off
The sensei, with this pen I slay
Pick up a queen in Miami, then get M.I.A., John Blaze, bitch

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the lyrical grand prix
We have our drivers racin for a $3,000,000 purse
Winner takes all, gentlemen start your engines...


Give me room, hit the tune
Feature presentation coming soon, early June
Killa Bee platoon, well groomed
Spells doom, raise the volume
You react like a werewolf in a full moon
With the force of a Trojan horse
Pushing forward, have your seat belt fastened
We blasting into orbit, Wu restore the new chamber
Wu-Banga number 9, expert precision and design
Mastermind the plan took a matter of time
From the confines of the cold world I shine
It's amazin, the grace, changin in the place
Blazin the brakes, invadin your space
Which remains in the race, claimin first place
Raisin the stakes, it's a game to disgrace
I hold many jewels, drop more than I wear
I come in peace, prepare for the warfare
The invincible fold, when they're caught in the square
And the talk mad shit when the coast is clear


Yes, ladies and gentlemen
We've just completed the first lap


Blood kin, knowledge, knowledge, I build with rap scholars
Guns and wallets, prowess, Staten Island stylist
12 men roster, live long, prosper
Street philosopher, you end up like Jimmy Hoffa
Ain't a damn thing changed but the aim, bullet range
Strange universe, I was nursed to blow your mainframe
Think first, convert, all verse live in concert
Pull a skirt, burst, while y'all niggas star search
Mind yours, why you eyeing mines for
Posing like a matador, I must got something you wanna die for
Touch mine, reach him up, his headline, both grant
9 inch rusty splint push through your nose is vent
Got my eyes on the grand prize, place your bet
Watch me win it by a landslide, pull off an upset
Hold the burner close by my hands and my pocket
Hold the trophy high and keep my eyes on the prophet


And a new driver has entered the contest
Ladies and gentlemen, driver number 99
In the red car...


Fog lights beam, car 99 supreme
A high-powered machine spits sparks of baroline
The smell of gasoline, motor roar, the crowd roars
The rag tuck rip, box cut caught in my jaws
Enforcing my laws, ramrod in my garage
The grease lightning, dusty rose, shake him, bon voyage
Now duel of the iron, flying feud for you writers
The speed demon, rebel talk, triggers, freedom fighters
Was tracked in the cock pit, I'm writing exact
I'm crushing corners, who that kid riding the track
With the Wu helmet, 6th nigga, 5 cars track
The last but not least, I bliss through the scrimmage
No brakes, I dart, I'm racing for the finish
Understand my hunger for my land down under
It's the thunderous rush, after the sounds get crush
The purse snatching pound, by all means snatch cream
Tear your ass out of town


As we near the final lap
Team Wu-Tang seems to be buildin
A sizeable lead on the competition


Yo, I know how to fold 'em like Kenny Rogers
Popular demand, overstand these piranhas
Moving on the track like a Monaco GT
I stand out similar to 3D on your TV
Easily breezing watching the speed dial climb
Style of rhyme, left the foes miles behind
Leaving skid marks on the charts
Aimed at the hearts of the fake, sparked on the tapes
It's starts from the gate, darts penetrate
Freestyle as the decoy to sharpen the bait
Holding major weight, my Supreme Team dominates
Circulating, taking all bets you place
In and out of state, twirling L's on the freeway
NY to SC, NC to VA, GA to MD, CA to KY
FL to IL, TX to MI


As we near the checkered flake, ladies and gentlemen
Team Wu-Tang's holding down the 1st, 2nd and 3rd positions
And it looks like it's goin to be another sure win for Team Wu-Tang
As they take home another pot of gold with this $3,000,000 purse
Rebel INS, U-God, Street Life

Get the loot, get the loot
Cash money y'all, cash money y'all, cash money y'all




Come on! Yeah... yeah..
Yo, yo


Wu-Tang, we always in the Spot Lite
Get paper, every night is hot night
We stay tight, we just livin' our life
We just livin' our life


I drink till I'm drunk, smoke skunk with my stinkin ass, smell the funk
Eekin out the pours, cum stain, shitty drawers
Pissin' down ya elevators shaft, no class, writin graf' on ya walls
It be us, fuck ya law, nigga, my cause is "because"
No yin to my yang, it's a black thing
Used to be in chains, now we snatch chains
Took the crack game applied it to the rap game, y'all
Pop quiz, now, what artist hits the hardest?
Get down with the syndrome: retarded
I think it was them swordsmen, place ya chess pieces on the boards and
Take it to square, this ain't no Yacub affair
Or a New World Disorder, got us, fuckin the coal miner's daughter
That y'all, but not us
Fly back, flag a cab and say "check ya"
Next time you see me, say peace and I'll respect ya, Tical




Yo, lights, cameras, don't forget the action
The needle skip, but the turntable scratchin'
Chain blow, bangles, heavy on the cashin'
Same old, Range rove', rainbow Manhattan
Craftmen, captive, still I'm avalanchin'
Holy war, handsome, break 'em off harassin'
Latest fashion, passion, bullets reign gashin'
Flippin' through frenzy, the same Wu-Tang
The Hollywood frame, purple haze stain
Rules of dame, fools, choose to bang
Nigga, you lose, Wu, bruise the game
A few men came, that really held weight
Drop, Chinese bars, stars in fifty-two states
Like, bats out of hell, we crash the gates
Without a base, left the gun powder case
Ladies chase, the hip-hop Babyface




Word up, throw your hands in the air, like you just don't care
Wu-Tang in your atmosphere, everybody say "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"


Mic Capone, it's best to avoid my strike zone
I zone and swing a sword that'll slice stone
Nice clone, but you could never match the born master
Who tore back half the world, and still saught after by
Dick ridin' niggas, and chicks who do ditto
Singin' like the Four Tops, providin' info
See me low, through the Jeep window, the chrome spins slow
Gene-ral on the J.O., survival M.O
For now get wild, similar to Ol' Dirty
A third time felon just hit with over thirty
Note worthy style, have them so thirsty
First degree heat, you quittin' on me
Cold turkey, no mercy




Wu-Tang, put you in the Cobra Clutch, til you give up
Ya'll can live up to, Witty Unpredictable
Street mentality, return of the cavalry
36 Chambers, we off key block
Black on the block, tell ya D.J.'s to quit
M.C.'s, to stop that bullshit
Me, Ghost and Rae, we known to pull shit
Step with the brick, on some Ice Water shit
Wallo's in all colors (now) let's get chips, like
Robbin' the bank, pull up with the new whips
Don't get mad, respect rank
No matter how you gettin' dough, give thanks
Everybody hold up your shanks






I grew up around block parties ready to rock
Behind the rope nigga with my rhymes on cock
The verse shot first nigga who had shit to pop
A bad weather blow the feathers off a hundred flocks
With 70% goose, 30 ducked, get stuck
And each link in your chain is trucked
No ends in this rhyme cipher with nine snipers
Charge of the kiss from the Pied Piper
I live around DJ's, b-boys, MC's
Through rap never thinkin' +Airways+ are TVs
It was strictly all about magnificant rhyme clout
+Rec Room+, 2 dollars with the flyer as we would doubt
Now his wigs pushed back
Name scratched off the plaque, too wild to re-enact
(Yo)


Got to check out +The W+, got to check out-- +The W+
Got to check out +The W+, got to check out-- +The W+


MC's have the right to remain silent
Everything you say can and will be used against y'all muh'fuckers
And Mef can only trust ya as far as I can see ya
Me need ya? That'll be the.. day, ya busta
It gets no rougher when, me and my comrades rush ya
Like red heat with hammers and sickles
I milk like ya baby mama's nipples, got issues
It's just us, so what's what if any can touch us
Then lord strike me down where I stand at now
Wit this bottle of Remy, gettin' fucked up child, listen
The most notable MC, ya source for hip hop quotable MC
Of course it's Tical!




The Princess, the Pope, incest, dope
Choke you by the throat, the chrome handle smoke
The man not for joke, we all out for broke
Plus the herbal that I tote, the murder that I wrote
You can't do me none, my Uzi weighs a ton
I'm comin' from the slum, Wu is number one
I stumbled on the drum, the Gods are troublesome
+Rumble+ when we come, boy you better +Run+, +Run+




Aiyo, it's like this jumpin' out of golden whips
Flashin' mega bricks, outfits, rock ridiculous whips, bitch
Wavy hair, men of the year, bent in the stairs
Sick winter gear, been on position is where
Call him an Asiatic God-body, +Longevity+
Slang rap, you get your whip wrapped
Swing through the hood calmly
Yo what up? Staten Island, Bush, George
Dust your shit off, whips spin off
Get off, slips, which, wiz
Mind di-tects mines, lines lick sick nines
Pick wines, lift up, bill a nigga six flies
Dip wide, dress my shit up, fuck six times, wish mine
Rub lamps, take thousand dollar crystalines






Still living by the code too many pretty women still living by the...
I'm just tryna get a meal
When I started rhyming wasn't tryna get a deal I was tryna get a feel
Homocide housing bodies lying in the Hill, man they nothing with me dying in the field especially when I'm tryna pay the bills
A lot of y'all relying on the steel
And see the court denying your appeal
If y'all don't know, nothing you better know its real
If it work like a workshop better know the drill
I'm past childish games, y'all just tryna take me outta my game
And calling my black women out of their name
I'm serious stay out of my brain
Understanding my slangs, Fast and Furious, stay out of my lane
Boy I'm hot, kids be calling me Blaze
In the industry I'm not, they be calling me slave
I ain't tryna burn the spot, but I'm setting my ways
I'm just a Product of the block and the city I'm raised
I'm still living by the code
Too many pretty women still living by the stroll daddy pimping them for dough
Early in the morning cops kicking in the do'
Man I Think somebody's snitching on the low
I caught my father sniffing on that snow
That's when he tried to tell me things are different than before
Kids don't listen any mo', thats fo' sho'
We used to ask permission from my fo'
Ain't no food up in the kitchen cause we broke
I ain't tryna miss Another, meal cause love it get you killed
And if it dont your baby mother will
But y'all ain't recognizing that is, real untill that undercover pulls his shield and now it's kinda late to cut the deal
So I ain't gotta tell you how I feel
While im tryna get my pockets stuffed with hundred dollar bills
I should've went to school and get a skill
But it wasn't in my future so I stealed, that's why I got this Ruger in ya' grill


Cracker treasure chest is one of the best
Now, feel the force of the full Court press
I apply to kiss the death, something for real the realness
Untouchable, Eliot Ness, you select of vet
Take me off the bench, I suppose to lynch,
The angel in the air you can smell my stench
Soldiers in the trench, moving east to west
I gave you a note, you can keep the rest
RIP the whole coast when I heat the flesh
At the greek fest, hit a couple of bars
Smash rips on strips like bumber cars
You're amongst the odds, with lies in the pelly
The baby, nine, the size of a celly
Now it's a dilemma like Nelly and Kelly
Milk Pirelli Tower when I peel it in a hurry with a fist of fury
Martini with a cherry is very necessary when I make it to the top
I'mma pop Halle Berry Staten Island fairy where the legends were made
In the staircase throw a rap grenade
Take it back in the day, get clapped for your chain
"F" the blood bath it will be half of the pain
He is a high grand bullet women call him daddy
Fish tank shoes jump out the Caddy
Grand finale yo the champ is here
The cameras glare under the chandelier
While you standing there, like you can hold it down
Its nine of us all of us rock the crown
Tear it down down to the last compound
New York mixed with a Compton style
Roll bonkers wild, on the stomping ground
Lay down the carpet when I'm walking down the isle
Then Telephone  keep stalking the child
Four misdemeanor now I'm going to trial
So secluded in exile like my sex while
Private jet style who's the livest vet now`
Pass me a wet towel don't get Vexed now
I ring it your chest when I let the tech growl


We used to rock um, leather gooses
With sheep skin coats and bombers
British Walkers, sharp skinned tailor made
Playboys black swede, three finger rings name plate rope chains
DVD, nylon cazal frames and matching with the Kangol hat
You couldn't have it, brother might snatch it
Flashback 1 90 E with the mock neck
Lee suit 25 nickels we shh
Fresh blue on white Pumawith the track Nike
Shell toe Adidas with the  no laces
Late night summer time jam we in the park
Allah Math cutting, DJ spitting his dart
Sergio Cassini brown swede bally
Jay crossed Town, 
Fresh leather Went to wether maximum spoiler kid
Legendary Duece flick Slick Rick
Run DMC, Jam master Jay
Wu-Tang Clan, Scott La Rock, KRS-ONE

Bizzy Killa Bee, yeah yeah
See crack never kept me high longer than five minutes
Wallaby Clarks  of course silk and linen
Jumbos two for five come and get it
Mamma cries tears of fear when I was wilding son
Please dont wear that, people are getting killed for that
Latin quarter union Square you had to be there
The fever, MC glory, ripping the armoury
This is Hip Hop to me, and for all of y'all, this is Wu-Tang Clan
Signing off, you know how we do forever


Ay yo I gotta be around this music it's therapeutic
Lick my first  blunt off the day then start the movement
I'm chilling in a room with a view, there's always room for improvement
So I grab my coat and go and prove it
Its me against the world, you can find me in the streets
You don't spot me in the lobby probably find me in a freak
Cop Ferraris, the law be in the lining of my seats
Tryna put me in a line up till I wind up in a beast
That's the belly, how dare they tryna tell me when to eat?
With this plate of food barely in my reach
My team shoot dice, we used to shoot skelly in the streets
Wore the same pelli pelli for a week
But now we live the life, its such a good Life
I wish that I could live it twice
I'll probably make the same wish my wife
It's Wu-Tang Clan always collect cheddar
Proper education always correct error


Crime scene, coppers and sirens helicopters
High beam the tension is Rising
Fiends keeping they pipes Clean
This is what life's mean?
A dollar and a dream everybody wants nice things
The kid was only 19, hole in his chest now, he's fighting
For his last breath to seeing death is frightening
The grip on the ghetto is tightening
You try to do the right thing, and they do you just like King
Now I can hear the night scream sirens and light beams
 bad shots, hitting people that they didn't mean to pop
The neighbourhood's in shock, block extremely hot
Another black teen shot is a normal routine for cops
They should've got good grades, work the minimum wage
Now they lying on the stretcher with nothing in them to save
Keep it ghetto, and whatever ghetto you at
Just don't love the ghetto, cause the ghetto don't love you back


Gotta be around this music it's therapeutic
First fresh thought to tell you so clear
When I'm Walking my head, There's a voice that talks
In my ear, I can hear it so clear (you Think im bugging right)


The average man, wouldn't last that lang
She like to work out run Marathons
She wear, tight skirts with no panties on
She's a 6 foot 1 bronze amazon
Saying, complaining about all the good men gone
I'm from Babylon she reach the 
Holding jails in the nail salons
She rock Coco Chanel her smell was strong
With skin like velvet, she rocked my bags
She gave, no 
She a spread eagle at the tip of the bed
She rubbed on her legs this is what I said
Rap music is therapeutic to me
Rap music is therapeutic to me


Ay yo You ain't lived 'till you made your first million
And top models wanna pop out yo Children
I thought I told you Wu tang is for the Children
Way Before rap moving crack in your building
Yeah, now whats the price of rice in China
These women tryna raise the price of her vagina
Me, Im tryna live and get the grinder
Like Diddy, but I ain't tryna give the Shyne up
Pop pop pop off no question
See Ol' Dirty like it raw no protection
When the kid hold court no objections
Meth needs his Money out the door no exepction
I go hard in the paint on a rapper
I go harder on a Xanax and Viagra
You Think im tripping, aiming the trick and
But keep a snow Bunny in the kitchen I'm the master like Killa




Yo, yo, yo, yo
Vendetta inside, swiftly start stabbin
One second to meltdown, feel the twin cannons
Burn, handgun herns, standin firm
Return from mega-death, I'll tell you what's left
Dilemma, Earth tremor, up by man
With the Grand Canyon rap, U dynamic wingspan
The Power from the Clan, yo, is more than fantastic
Pull pins out the hazard, on this Battlestar Galactic'
Skull tactic, sporatic, Asiatic, long awaited
Son of Sam, mention the mic mutated
You hated us, cuz we immortal on wax
Rip the China White shit, flip a dynamite ax
Shillac em perhaps, the heart pump an anti-toxin
Feed me the Power, meteor shower when I'm boxin


Professional vets, now comin through vexed
I'm testin you vets, what you claimin that you best?
The S on your chest, better stand for Super-stress
And Leathaface pressed, next, here to set you
REC! I suggest niggas come To the Rescue


I know how to part your medula, oblong gotta
Test the rocket launcher, they'll get conquered
By my block sponsers, monster Tonka truck ya
The whole train conductor
A hole in your spine, rip your stomach mothafucka
Brotha suffer, my Dutch puff as sinister as the Feds
Infrared, signin on the Glock, splittin ya head
Drippin wet from death threat messages I inject
Intellect reflects worldwide over Internets
Heart colder than Winter Fresh, chest smokin like incense
Vets broken into the flesh, soakin in ya own mess
Chrome bleds, some of the known best soldier vets
Over cassette, you get smashed like crashed desert air shows
Holdin ya breath, gaggin for a bit of oxygen
Submission put a stop to men, reveal the foul document
Lockin position, invision, adapt critical condition
Pitiful you didn't listen, now we're spiritual blessin
Viewer discretion advised, sabotage satellites
Splatter guys, get ya food ate like I'm Big Mac and fries
Trap nines in the thighs, symbolize real lives
Instill a rocket fuck from the inside to the outside
In ya mouth lied the barrel, subdue bone marrow
Ya tone shadow, blown from high-explosive poem battles
Dome smack, you live, projectiles effectin you
Incredible new wave heart, blade sharp verses sexin you
Claim professional, but I never met you
Son I never forget you
I slaughter foes when my particles wet you
To the Rescue


Professional vets, now comin through vexed
I'm testin you vets, what you claimin that you best?
The S on your chest, better stand for Super-Stress
The Golden Arms pressed, next, here to set you
REC! I suggest niggas come To the Rescue


Slash hope, raw burnin, freezin thoughts are cold
Ballistic missle lift off, now one behold
My throat harden for Harlem, harness the volume
With grief fallin on me in a breeze, the seas partin
It's two men awesome, uncanny
The handy man crook, the rap gank where every damn nook and cranny
Plus four more opponents couldn't throw me, couldn't slam me
I told you before, this is war, it's radical claw
Menate the law, practice my ambition
Understand determination, plus my burnin condition
Rebuild 'em, sing a song strong for disaster
Scorch 'em on a letter, clever, bled 'em much faster
Exotic lens, bionic Timb's, hardco' organic
The floor panic when revolvin, Shaolin dodgin
Potion of my juice, it's "Houston we have a problem"
Its Basic Instinct, motor mouth, hold is sacred
The Rushmore Rock Face, one four shot with the greatness
Raw shoulders, sword colder, no remorse
The crash course, the portions of my Porsche
Divorse it, the Holocaust exhaust, driven with force
Mighty ship back on course, I almost lost it
Toss the smokin corpse, seldom sing
Shells amongst men, rebellion, teens formin and swarmin
Vikin style, strikin without warnin a nation
Standin ovation, rap devastation
New animation, the scandal
Bandle the best part, damsel in distress, I'll bless you
God damn you! To the rescue


Professional vets, now comin through vexed

I'm the best ever, I'm the most brutal and vicious
And most ruthless champion there's ever been
There's no one can stop me, there's never been nobody who could ---
I'm Sonny Liston, I'm Jack Dempsey, there's no one like me
I'm from their cloth, there's no one who can match me
Praise be to Allah!


Just jewels, no crew heavy, my inside pants lay
Come packing like two machetes, one ratchet
Two clubs and a mask, jumping out a green rover
Niggas balling me down, that's when I reached over
Figured they ain't got no manners, young boys round here
They don't know my status
See niggas looking for a full time jack move
But they don't know, that these blades here crack dudes
Give it to them quick, something like fast food
Take a nigga gun like, you gon' blast who?
Cinderella girl, fronting in them glass shoes
Homo thug, bitch ass nigga, I smash you
You mad, cuz you rocking a shit bag, smelling like piss
When it popped, ya click ran, you fucking with powerful men
Come value your business, it ain't all gravy
You pussy niggas, you'se the Avon lady, fuck you


We scuffle, raps and cracks, it's a known hood hustle
Through the bus stop, under the train trussle
Forty five degrees, divide the block muscle
Stay on your side, or get your life bubbled
(We tussle, raps and cracks, it's a known hood hustle
Through the bus stop, under the train trussle
Forty five degrees, divide the block muscle
Stay on your side, or get your wig knuckled)


Yo, I hit 'em up with the snubs, puff the bigger buds
So sinister, a John Dillinger, yeah, I've been a thug
Fire all cylenders, swing with gritty love
Smooth talk, watch a moonwalk up in the club
I'm like Michael Jackson without the glitter glove
Go get it for sure, that's right, a jitterbug
A minister of death, came back to finish ya
At the tip of the missile, a fish, you been a scud
That's right, it's in my blood, damn, what's in them drugs
They make you spit slugs, leave marks in the floor
Yo, I stomp through the yard, I march through the hall
Charles Bronson them hard, Jack Johnson your jaw
If I sell out, yo, I'm copping some more
Get the hell out, or I'm popping the four
Shell pour out, big boxes of bullets
Your snotbox is bust, when I cock to the fullest




Consider me pissed off, them swiners better throw in they whole chalk
'Fore I blast the hot shot of Smirnoff
Rhymes contrast to an airplane crash
I precede the aftermath of an acid bath
Take a leap from the highest, and walk home bloody from a riot
And still stay chubby on a diet
Chicken in Michigan, get ya head crushed wit a Michellen
It's obvious, the God ain't settling
Repetition and ego, buried in ghetto cathedrals
Blow the rugers, brothers wanna through rubbles
Rock fight avalanches and ambushing
Contaminated bitches, dirty dishes and dope pushes
I dreamt plus I get a rush from a toilet flush
It wasn't us, it was Paul and his brother
Uncle and four cousins, they had to die like the Dirty Dozen
I guzzle punks like 22's, embezzle words and verbs, and interval avenus
It's important to be caution, click of this magnitude is remorsing
We eat the fucking cake without the frosting
Contents contained, shatters his splattered brain
Ever since Killah Priest was ordained
I'm bringing back the revely, I had with Beverly
And half of you corn niggas is greener than celery, fuck outta here




My style is impetuous, my defense is impregnable
And I'm just ferocious, I want your heart
Praise be to Allah!




Have you seen your friends turn to snakes
Then transform into rats
While running through the jungle
I can tell you all 'bout that


Let's get this straight, I'm way above all this hate
I'm in my lane, I'm circling with no brakes
And no blinkers, my team still runnin' gunnin'
Still hungry, you think that you could sink us thinkers?
Windex clean, no way I'm gonna see the clinker
And if I'm dirty, you think that you could link us think of
Another format, informant, I'm not your doormat
I hear clicking on my phone jack, no callbacks
The phones that, matter fact yo I know it's tape
Matter fact, didn't you just catch a case?
You in my face, acting like you high as fuck
Gucci belt showin' out man you wired up
This tide is up, the God gotta live this out
I'm in the rut but my gut's never giving out
I'm in the moment, staring at the hearing now
Can't tear me down, I'm living like a righteous child
I had these thoughts, knew I had to write them down
No sun rays, I live this shit underground
The devil's back, he's mad at my lifestyle

 X2


Handle my hardware, always had to earn my keep
Money and friendship, always had to turn the beef
Behind my back, you should of had your words with me
But talk is cheap, acting like you own the streets
You want beef, well all I'm doing is tryna eat
But we was mans, plans, million dollar scams
Now June 24th you're lying on a fucking stand
The judge slam the hammer, in grand jury glamour
Now it's club fed vacation in the Alabama
I ask myself, should I put down the hammer
These blood sucking vampires always coming at'cha
Leeches on my back, bottom feeders body snatchers
Savages, in pursuit of happiness
My wife want half of this, oh she's tryna jam me up
You won't get half of this, sorry then no tummy tuck
I ask myself, for the fame for the bucks?
Now ask myself man, aw she just starstruck
I tricked on timbs, had flicks of her my best man
Creeping on the Westin, spotted in the West Inn!

 X2






What y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
This '97
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to '79


I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultraviolet shine blind forensics
I inspect you, through the future see millennium
Killer Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets, Queen Bees ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block


As the world turns, I spread like germ
Bless the globe with the pestilence
The hard-headed never learn
This my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life standing firm
On foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
Transform into the Ghost Rider
A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire
Who got my back in the line of fire holding back?
What? My peoples if you with me, where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
What the blood clot? We smoke pot and blow spots
You want to think twice? I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums


I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
Vocabulary 'Donna talking, tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what? Run for your brother kid
Run for your team and your "six can't rhyme" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme, your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts, paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought
I got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God


The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang


Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape Hell globe spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anaesthesias
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings


March of the wooden soldiers, C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square we stay in gold like Flair
Escape from your dragon's lair
In particular my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat bass lines on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck, I'm ducking five-year probation


War of the masses, the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song


The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none


Yo Yo Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink, you had a Navy green
Salamander fiend, bitches overheard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cork-pop convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese, is that so?
Ceaser needs the greens, it's Earth
Ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz


Aiyo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer, Blue-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor world tranquilizer
Adjust the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening
Guaranteed made 'em jump like Rod Strickland






Weve just received a report that New York City is under attack by swarms of killer bees. Theyve been seen approaching from Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. We urge you to stay in your homes at this time, as we will be bringing you up-to-the-minute information. This just in: Police are reporting that theres a man on top of a skyscraper, ready to jump. Im told that he is possibly Ol Dirty, a member of the Wu-Tang Clan. The police suspect that there could be some connection between this old dirty man, and the killer bees


What y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
This '97
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to '79


I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits tremendous
Ultraviolet shine blind forensics
I inspect you, through the future see millennium
Killer Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets, Queen Bees ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function

The hard-headed never learn
This my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life standing firm
On foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
Transform into the Ghost Rider
A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire
Who got my back in the line of fire holding back?
What? My peoples if you with me, where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
What the blood clot? We smoke pot and blow spots
You want to think twice? I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums


I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
Vocabulary 'Donna talking, tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what? Run for your brother kid
Run for your team and your "six can't rhyme" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme
Your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts
Paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought, I got the fashion
Catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God


The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang


Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape Hell globe spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anaesthesias
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings


March of the wooden soldiers
C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square we're staying gold like Flair
Escape from your dragon's lair
In particular my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat bass lines on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck, I'm ducking five-year probation


War of the masses, the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song


The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple
Stab wounds and leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none


Yo, yo yo; fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink, you had a Navy green
Salamander fiend, bitches overheard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cork-pop convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese, is that so?
Ceaser needs the greens, it's Earth
Ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz


Aiyo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer, Blue-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor world tranquilizer
Adjust the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening
Guaranteed made 'em jump like Rod Strickland



Rocket on...to the break of dawn...elevation yo...

(Verse)
Elevation smell the vibration mystique beneath the beat cave in
Super freak meaty bone tones discreet goncha leave is a sweet sensation
(egg is I) forsaken take over in
The making live wire retire all great men
Mic-pope rope-a-dope (ma-des-en) intention
Broke through your fences now this is the redemption
Nerve wrechin unstoppable high colossal
Tonsil obstacle-able hard to true bobbin
Shopping through no question
Honey I'm sexual intellectual (vamp) rhyming professional
Swing all the ladies in I directional potential bright clever and soft
Whatever more encore the shit you adore   hard


Cause its hard turbo charge and I'm doing shit my way
Bon Voyage Shaolin dodge nigga I'm going shit my way
Turbo charge nigga its hard cause I'm doing shit my way
Yes its hard praise to god nigga I'm doing shit my way

How it sounds now hold it down right down to the ground...

(Verse)
Pleasure the light mic the treasure strangers in the night
Can't fight the spinning (lining) of pearl from left to right
Have guns (yo will) travel milky way dripping in the brisk
At your own risk silver shadow
That might lurk in the image in the Pharaoh when the road gets narrow
An hour off after hour devour with the power the background amp
Wine (your mission) to the party mix champ
Wu stamp genie out the lamp cramp sex position
Exposition body count technician bets deep rising ask killa-shit
Wax __-ize this courage of the fearless wu enterprise sent to risen
Grand prize landslide pipe in holy lighting told me I'm frighten
Goldie the only __ speaking that excitement



(Verse)
I feel the earth moving under my feet
I feel the crowd come tumbling down how it sound all around now
We going to party now hold it down
We going to party-hardy right down to the ground






Boldly go only to sew the block up, lock shit down
Mama told me you the giant
Bump out the nose cold, crime wave wholesome
Baritone throne, so defiant
They stole the science from the O.G
Carbon copy, sloppy, tryna muscle out the Old E
Slapshot, can't get it past the goalie mask
Stonefinger roam, royalty zone off
Henn, gin, rummy stunts coming in sums
Writing on ya tummy hun, low stamina, still hungry some
Asthma clogged up, ran in smog, dialogue, dorm plasma
Road hogging all hammers
No matters what's the track's right and exact, it's madness
The scanner listen, system jam up
Right on ya rack, Black Panthers on a mission
Right back at you, ready to cook this shit
Babylon apple, natural habitat
Stone statues *planes crashing*


Robotron Golden Arms, pentagon brain cell, all to
Gain, chained to the bumper
Wolfgang hunters, field goal punters tone,steel toe
Eruption, it's a gusher!
Tonecrusher smith,usher the style,stubborn born
Criminals foul within the isle
Let off a signal with attitude,magnitude ,beat
Through, me devil lies that's sized of cathedrals
The track more lethal, came back to see you
Finish the job off proper, live wire shit, spit the
Lava,the helicopter hit you, flyin saucers, of
Course,may the force not be with you
These bengals that dangle, sinister phantom menace
Hansome are my lenses, all in the register, speakin my
Spanish, clips like banana grips, bananza, dressed
Fancy in the club, Halle Berry slowdance, we romance
Now gimme love
(more planes,and pilots panicing.)


Jackie Chan movements, hard to kill for real
Drill him some more with some
Old fashion smooth shit, long winded
Splendid the bomb blow, on the whole a ruthless
Butter roll flow, show improvement?
This shit is cool whip to me
When I throw off the wool
This music with a mule kick
Eight ball in the side pocket corner
One mark the chalk, gimme my poolstick
Smoked the dipped
Notes by the throat, full grip, scud puddy in my hands
Fans, read the blueprints
The truth is, the slang you bit?
To form in a sentence the cold winters I spent with splinters
The apprentice under RZA's training
He sang, each aim's vintage aimin at you swine eater
Wife-beater scoundrels, stolen vowel thieves
I'm swollen now, Collen Powel relief
Throw the towel in, tools in, full spin, school em again
Show em that the wise could rejuvenate
All these hoodlums, don't sleep he could win
Pull a pen, it's full again, celeb, all in the web on a
Conquest, no disturbance
Address it to ya chest, you're in turbulence
Mighty men vitamin D
Rest in Peace to my nigga Bigga B, love you G
Rest in Peace to my nigga Bigga B, love you G




Yo.. yeah
Don't erase none of that good shit in the beginnin
Yo.. spill drinks on ya, get stank on ya
Yo.. yo.. pinky ring shit, yo
That pinky ring shit, yo


It's that pinky ring shit, the legend of masked kid
Shoot out the speakers when my guns get jurassic
Superbad, who am I? Dolemite classic
The vandal's back, hands on Angela Bassett
I handle my plastic, gunplay I mastered
No coke, dope mixed down with acid on record
Broken down and crafted in seconds
Lady's choice, the golden voice still peppered
Better, respect it, bitch believe
I pull rabbits out the hat, tricks up my sleeves
I air out the showroom, the shit can breathe
Fix your weave, behold my expertise


I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back
I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back


Take it back to the peoples, leanin' gettin' rec room punch
We in them authentic alley switchin joints
Major general niggas, five stars
Both arms rock when coke dropped we read a hundred niggas palms
Silencers, garbage bags of hash
For every cop we paid retired now the nigga on smash
Gash you out your burner fast
You swing down hatin me now respect get your fingers off the glass




Yo what the fuck yo?! Yo what the fuck y'all comin for?
Get the fuck away from my door!
We got big guns in here, coke over there
With blue bag and E pills stashed under the chair
And there's Boss Hog black and white pit with the pink lips
Stan thought he was soft 'til he bit his fingers
The shit had me dyin yo, big fat nigga bleedin
Big cat nigga all season
On the beach truck, stuck with Hawaiian ice
Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought FUBU
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
18 karat rap between noodles




Up at Killa Bee headquarters, four whips just pulled up
I saw Johnny sippin Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin off the hip
I sit took three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead king, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ".. Any Means Necessary"


John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all get shot


New York, New York, legendary rhyme boss
Code name Charlie Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
You crash-tests can't measure the threat
I dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah
Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin, feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself
The Noble, Sir I mass mogul
Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals


This is grown man talkin, coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect father Eton with Addies
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see


From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets








* samples were not cleared for the official album release


Y'know? General, general! Word out...
Yeah...
Aiyyo man.. you poppin fuckers
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


It's just rules with beats - you clown niggas can't rule the streets
We set shop! Wu-Tang, we rule the East
Taking over the block!
"From the gate now!"
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
Aiyyo, it's just rules with beats - you clown niggas can't rule the streets
We set shop! Wu-Tang, we rule the East
Taking over the block, you can't fuck with the block!
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Aiyyo, I stay funky and piley, blue Excelero
They lookin for me, what the fuck you behind me for?
Stressing everything I breathe on
I'm from the boulevard where niggas get jacked and peed on
Whatever homey, we more lavish
I might sneak you in the crib, see my lasers and glasses
Try to get my come up on
Yo, and when you see me, you know I got my "come up" arm on
Cartier called me up, robbery here
We got your seed in the back of the Beemer starving
We like lion killers, catch me on stage with the gauge
In my right hand, grenade and this leather bomber
I scout money, you know we hungry and talk funny
Coughing out corner rappers, don't never walk up on me
I write with only insane Malkovich
My troops gave me money to clown with them, fuck it
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


My first gun was a .32, back before uh!
Graduated to the .38, maybe a nine
I prefer the fo' five, stay alive
Techs held the crack gank in '88
8 oz. straight from Florida, the best temp
Camouflage vest, repping the set
Wu on the east wing, twenty-ten, sexy bad
We up at Spain with that thing thing, my crew strong
We take no search for your party dunn, you know how I run
Spray places, cover faces, beat cases
A big mouth will get your teeth knocked the fuck out
Keep a nunchuk, take money, stay ninja
I injure, any motherfuckin contender
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Hey bitch, your time's up! Go finish them rhymes up
All my soldiers is lined up, my corners is crimed up
Niggas know where to find us, settin the grind up
Police checkin them pies up, my rims are shined up
Wu! We on the rise up, crops supplied up
Plottin niggas demise up, boxed in conduct
Scratch we got 'em sized up, and when the East is in the house
You, you, you, you, you...
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


On the side of the projects, grey skully, bubble 'Lo goose
Mac 11 tucked in front of the belly
Prestigious moves, we killin 'em, hoes we drillin 'em
We like George Foreman out in the streets, we grillin 'em
In the van, .45's and dilly's, ready to slam it
House arrest box is goin off, Tony got grams
Gotta bath tub full of white, lay in it like Sam Montana
Tune 'em out, to blow out, chop 'em like fans
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


This is boulevard hard, lounging in your black car
Camouflage rat guard on "Stomp the Yard"
I-N-S spit monster bars, flip long regards
My click dons bitch, y'all are frauds
I get it in like Tim off the glass
Slamming my name, I'm like the prez, sending men off to blast
What I spit, make 'em spend all their cash
I'm so Wu, so new that I ain't ripped off the tags
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


RZA done birthed us, some curse on purpose
I'm the grouch, my mouth is a circus
Burner plus a good learner, don't need a hood
All I need's a good burner, Nat Turner
Snake rat murderer, all I hear is turf talk
Rack rooms full of goons with bullet wound birthmarks
From the first spark, you heard my response
(Wu-Tang!) More results talkin 'bout whole crew's mission just lost
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Out the beehive, you dip and you dive
But you still can't survive, you can't see past five
Check the outlook, this is not in the book
You bein dragged across the floor while your 'dro in my hook
Lyrical joust, found all the deal off the books
Steve Rif gave the nod to Universal, good look
Still spit poison venom, Red Monkey and Wu dem
Have any dudes seen the condos? It's all 'em
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Put my +clan in da front+, +reunite+ 'em
Make 'em all R.S.V.P., if they want it, we don't invite 'em
No beef, less talk and more action
We parole as a whole, we'll send you back in fractions
Break through fanatic, low crates deep in attics
The Abbott pulled out a .45, looped with static
I scrolled through the menu then rolled to the venue
The dress code is armor all, put a hole up in him
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)



Fuckin around, its that the fuckin clown?
40 Cent? (uh-huh)
If you real thing, cuz you was here
You'll be fuckin dead, you hear me cock-sucker, DEAD!


Yo, yo, yo
Who the hell is 50 Cent? Crook with a deal
Keep talkin, you gon' meet a crook with a steel
You really want beef, I'mma hand you war
Got big guns, shit you never seen before
Just a no-name nigga, seekin the rep
'bout to take aim, spit a hot flame in your chest
Although everythin was cool, had to start wildin
Front all you want, but not on Shaolin
Point blank, simple and plain, you small change
Tear you up out of the frame from close range
Fake 50 Cent tryin to face the best
Wanna impress me? Let me see you fake your death
Until then, you herb, don't deserve respect
What possesed you? Who gave you the nerve to flex?
God bless you, I'mma lay your soul to rest
Think about it next time you'll pose a threat


2x
Who the hell is 50 Cent? Cornball frontin
'nother studio thug, ain't hurtin nothin, nigga
And your raps ain't built for that
On the real, niggas get killed for that


So you wanna stick the Gods for they funny-ass rings?
How dare you? Clip your wings and straight aim
You be careful, how you mention the name
Speaks codes, I violate your clan like parole
Who want it? Run in your lab without a warrant
What you gon' do now? Got your ass cornered
Feel a squad closing in, from all angles
Hit you, split you from your ass to your ankle
Let my dogs eat your food, hear my wolves howl at the moon
Lock down your body, leave the room
You fake fuck, wanna start with us?
Anybody ever told you, you talk too much?
Niggas want mine, I'mma put five on your bucket
Shine on the wrist, cost more than your budget
Who you? Face it, your whole camp doo-doo
Wanna get it on, nigga do you, fake fuck


2x
Who the hell is 50 Cent? Cornball frontin
'nother studio thug, ain't hurtin nothin, nigga
And your raps ain't built for that
On the real, niggas get killed for that


Yo, I lay long enough, for you cowards to eat
It's time to apply pressure, devour the streets
Yo, it seems another crab, like runnin his mouth
Where he at? Point him out, and I'm callin him out
Make his chick nod the head like she's suckin me off
Keep it raw, meat combat with the dog, dustin me off
No joke, you ain't never seen gun smoke
Nickel pump bastard, stick to playin jump rope
Who the bosses? Power like thoroughbred horses
With more guns than armed forces
You ain't ready, overnight joker
Strip you like poker, your bullshit's over
Give it to me raw, I want mine the foul way
Small change in this game, nigga like a child's play
Motherfuckin coward


2x
Who the hell is 50 Cent? Cornball frontin
'nother studio thug, ain't hurtin nothin, nigga
And your raps ain't built for that
On the real, niggas get killed for that


Fuckin 40 Cent
4 dimes and a nickel, God
I challenge you, thats right
Fuckin cheesy boy
Cream Team niggas see you boy
You better have your shit out
You better have your shit right, nigga
YouknowI'msayin?
We the flavoury niggas
We fuckin flavoury niggas
You fuckin coward
Trying to come in this shit
You know I'm sayin'?
We out here, you just small change




It's on 
(RZArector)


Yes the shit is raw coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, "Wu-Tang's back for more"
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)


This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
X Y  slam Nine Diagram pole
Raekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback Notre Dame
Golden Arms is bronze Buddha palm hit Qu'ran
It blows extreme, mainstream be the theme, supreme team
America's Cream Team, redeemed
Vidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone
Gun POW to the dome and split the bone
Wig blown off the ledge by the alleged
Full-fledged, sledge RZA edge
One dose of my feroc' handheld trigger cuts
A capella spitting shell paralyse if you get touched
And critical mic cords, hanging like umbilical
Cords, dope swords, five star general
Raw be the quote rap style sore throat
Through the fully operational, handheld totem




A hundred thousand times one, snatch up my styles get done
I hold a title, and here's how my belt was won, check it
Slick majestic, broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew through lack of effort
You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes
My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
Masked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords
And his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines
With more gains than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains
Poisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this
You get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this
Side effects of hot raps and hot tracks
A duffel bag full of guns son, dipped in black
My culture, glides and attacks you like a vulture
Ghostface in Madison Square is on your poster




Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy show it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
Of the Wu and learnt how to
Fuck up your anatomy steadily, calm and deadly
Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit
MCs submit to the will as I kill your
Juvenile freestyle, civilize the mental
Devils worship this like an icon
Bear-hugging mics with the grips of a python




You heard other raps before but kept waiting
For the Son of Song, I keep dancehalls strong
Beats never worthy of my cause, I prolong
Extravaganza, time sits still
No propaganda, be wary of the skill
As I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum
Dedicated to rap nigga, beware of the fearsome
Lebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat
CD massacre, murder to cassette
I blow the shop up, you ain't seen nothing yet
One man ran, tryna get away from it
Put your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh
Into your chamber like Freddy enter dream
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause, like a black jack to dat
You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertaining motherfuckers can't stop O
In battling, you don't want me to start tattling
All up on the stage cause y'all snakes keep rattling
Bitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you wanna clock me like Sherry
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry
Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in, and get ten dollars back
The fat LP with Cappachino on the wax
Pass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LPs back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt and dial 9-1-7
1-6-0-4-9-3-11
And you could get long dick hip-hop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction
I'm Staten Island best son, fuck what you heard
Niggas still talking that shit is absurd
My repertoire, is U.S.S.R
P.L.O. style got thrown out the car
And ran over by the Method Man Jeep
Divine can't define my style is so deep
Like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy
Like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind
Cause you weak in the knees like SWV
Tryna get a title like Wu Killa Bee
Kid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbott
Me and RZA rhyme name printed in the tablet
Under vets, we paid our debts for mad years
Hibernate the sound and now we out like bears
In Born Power, born physically, power speaking
The truth in the song be the pro-black teaching




The fox, is kinda foxy, Mr. Wolf he's the guy
Who chased Red through the woods and ate Grandma
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
Unlike the wolf, who made a widower of Grandpa


Yo, must I flex my cash, to sex yo' ass
I wet the Ave. when I set my path
The 'Vette don't crash, I'm built to long last
Grab my money clip, I hit the bong fast
Earn my respect, my checks they better cash
Finger on the trigger with my nigga Fred Glass
Knuckles is brass, start snuffin you fast
Jumpin outta cabs, grabbin money bags
Next shot go right through your hovercraft
You do the math my acid tongue slash
When will you learn it's return of Shaft
The genuine thriller, the Miller Draft
My force might blur, the Porsche'll purr
The apple martini, of course it's stirred
I'll do the honor,  the Shaolin bomber
Shark skin armor, I'll bring the drama




Damn, defecatin' on the map
Wu-Tang takin it back, no fakin in the rap
How real is that, cause niggas hatin on the fact
That the kid is blazin this track and hatin on 'em back
My dough's stacked up with O's, who the mack
Duckin po'-po's blowin smoke O's in the 'Llac
To be exact, don't want no hassle with the stack
In the Big Apple, we the rotten apples in the back
Yeah, it's all grillin, how the fuck y'all feelin?
Non-stop park killin, on the block we was killin 'em
The arch villans, when the blood start spillin
Any stuck start squealin, body bags we was fillin 'em
Yeah, now I got it in the smash
Ounce of marijuana and a llama in the dash
Me and my comrades followin the cash
And livin e'ry day like tomorrow is the last




I'm like the St. Bernard to ya baby when you're lost out in the snow
Like a coyote out on the desert...
Where the foxes never go
And the wolf, they never go...


Yo, would you recognize a jewel for what it is when you see it
Or would you take it for somethin else and get to' the fuck up
Men come together for the common cause
To beat yo' ass, just because
There's a line you don't cross offendin the boss
While of course his one selectin through your head shot
I'm back in the yard again, the bars callin
15 sets of this will have you swollen
Ladies like, "Damn papa you lookin right
I'd love to give you some of this pussy and I'm a dyke"
I write when the energy's right to spark friction
DJ cuttin it, spinnin it back mixin
Great pop knock tickin, poetry description
For the motion picture reenactment
Activate a hired assassin, keep it classic
Rap evolution every black, yo pass that








You ain't heard us in a minute, you heard us in a minute, man
(Wu-Tang!)
I keep banging on you niggas, finger on my trigger, man
(Wu-Tang!)


I love bankrolls, stank hoes, camera shots, Kangols, bangles
Pink records, check it, yeah, I make those
More paper than Kinko's, check my lingo, bingo
On my face, honey, not a wrinkle, trinkle
My twinkle twinkle, make your toenails crinkle
Twist up a dinkle, and honey, let's mingle, jingle
When the nightfall, I'm tight with my white walls
The greedy pain, draining on my life force
Behold the pale white horse, the hype loss with tight jaws
Fight law off, cuz I don't like ya'll
Huh, I'm from the tar pits, the hard target to squash the market
You're brain washed, watch the starships
I make cars flip, Deck bomb atomic, Islamic arms
Kiss the comet, this time, he's gone
I grip the don, rip arms out the socket, cock it
Fly logic, now watch me sky rocket, watch it
Hot as the tropic get, bulletproof asaphogus
Steel cage confidence, burn it on a floppy disc
Swerve the metropolis, my whole team in back of me
You just a half of ki, I'm a coke factory

 (x2)
You ain't heard us in a minute, you heard us in a minute, man
(Wu-Tang!)
I keep banging on you niggas, finger on my trigger, man
(Wu-Tang!)


Yo, thank god it's Friday, like it's just me and my chick
Cruising the highway, she twisting my piff
You see I'm living proof that crime pay, the type that go at a bitch
The type to shoot the gift, and blow every clip
I know this money like the back of my hand, you get the back of my hand
Just like a fiend who took a package and ran
Po-po be hopping out of passenger vans, harassing niggas in Park Hill
For marked bills, ratchets and grams
So I move like I'm ducking a charge, I'm trying to set up shop
Get this gwop, get the fuck out of dodge
Most my niggas like to puff in the car, most these hoes emotionally scared
And keep the works stuffed in they bras
This is ghetto rap, where the pot be calling the kettle black
My bullets trynna see where they head is at, I'm heading back
To the slums, back to the block, I got the Clan on my back
And you know we heading back to the top, nigga

 (x2)
You ain't heard us in a minute, you heard us in a minute, man
(Wu-Tang!)
I keep banging on you niggas, finger on my trigger, man
(Wu-Tang!)




Motherfucker, you don't know me, motherfucker
I be gettin' down for a long time, bitch
I be gettin' money since '88
My gun been going off, I been doing mad shit in the streets
My history is swell, motherfucker
That's why I can talk this shit, for real
This is real nigga shit, and motherfuckers know
My name ring bells in jail, bitch, what?


You don't have a chance, you don't want to dance
My gun goes blam, you don't want to dance with a gangsta
You don't understand, niggas ain't playin'
First time around, I come back swinging
You and your mans, you better just scram
My gun goes blam, you don't want to dance with a gangsta
You don't understand, niggas ain't playin'
Fuck around now, I come back sprayin'


Your gun cry tears of lead, one in the head
High grain, rhino shell, dum-dums, tear you to shreds
The armor piercin' slug shit, scare off the feds
Kid, I'm that fearsome, my hammer's a sled
Pledge allegience to my conquest, prepare for the bomb fest
Right and left connect like twin jumbo jets
I can feel the blood bubblin', under your flesh
I'm coming down here rollin' in my snowball effect
Put sugar in your ears and sweet talk you to death
My voice alone, don't have to force you for sex
Pop an ecst', get jumped off, the madness all in me
Flushed out my kidney's, with a half pint of Remy
Dust off the semi', with the speed of the centipede
Move on my enemy, and clear the vicinity
Feel my energy inside tearin' out
Clear it out, flame thrower's airin' out, baby




Come get a glimpse, the magnificent pimp
Leave your face prints stiff, and graved in cement
Invent the daily manuscript, return of the dragon fist
You pissed? Then seek anger management
Cuz my cannon kick back, with a gangsta metal
Went right through your rib rack, and kissed the devil
From the slang, now your brain is a twisted pretzel
In the empty hallway, you can hear the echo
Don't get petro', U-Godzilla stomped in the metro
Get wild like techno, collect the dough
For wreck, the side ball and better check your ho
Don't get mad, cowboy, just respect my glow
Just another episode, powerful breath control
Explodes in your ear, you can't hear me in death mode
In retrospect, you best Protect Ya Neck
Or get slapped the fuck up, by my next cassette, hear me?




This - is - the - warrior's anthem
Pose, in the pictures with the golden guns, handsome
Phantom of the opera, frantic in the mansion
The head banger boogie got 'em dancin' in the Hamptons
You panickin', one strike, get murdered up quick
And the mic's my life, and I'm surgical with this
Swift and wreckless, smoke blunts for breakfast
Master the game, this is chess, not checkers
Feel me? Bone collector, just, vision my art
In the darkness, vulture's come and, pick you apart
One rusty steel spike pierce, straight through the heart
I bleed for my Clan, don't let 'em, break us apart
Strong as Noah's Ark, in the Biblical age
Still, holdin' the Clan, in it's critical stage
Engage in combat, beyond shadows of doubt
Wu-Tang claim supremacy, son, I'm airin' out




Yo, man, if you was real, nigga
You would say niggas names, man
You ain't real dude, man, stop playing, man
You scared of niggas, niggas is runnin' with yo fuckin' name
You ain't doing shit, bitch, worry about your own shit
Talkin' about niggas can't talk this shit
Fuck, I've been doing this, nigga
I don't know what the fuck you talking about
Take over projects, and set up shop, quick fast




Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide (Zilla, Zilla)
Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide (Zilla, Zilla)


I'm taking all of your divas, I'm eating all of your pizza
Call me Daddy Gunsmoke, throwing long to receivers
Remember fights at the Fever, straight shifting your features
Cuz I'm sharp as a cleaver, spill blood in areas
Cuz I'm rougher then Lazarus, harder then Caesar
Bobber and weaver, straight flow, follow the leader
Mix the coke with the ether, keep snow on the freezer
Stomp gold on my Visa, it's an hour to geezer
Pop holes in your tweeters, your ho want me to bang her
I'm the one man army with tsunamis of swagger, bragger




Ready and able, cuz my blows are more fatal
I'm the human tornado, pulling guns out the cradle
It's a scene out Casino, scrape cream off the table
Shape pants enabled, break dancing, gold cables
Prada tags and labels, flood drugs with the draino
Put holes in your braino, then I'm off to Barbados
It's the black Clark Gable, jump out the sable and bang you
Wide turns on the angle, sideburns with the banger
Curtains you up for danger, hurting you with the chamber
Circle you with the flamer, hurting you with the stinger, ringer




It's a whole 'nother level, yo, I'm hot as a kettle
Yo, I handle my business, boy, I body the devil
Yo, I'm diamond embezzled, plus I Hollywood shuffle
And I'm so rebellious, cuz I polly with Russell
And I got hood muscle, when it's on, I say it's on
I'm real, militant, a don, I'm Genghis Khan
I got the bangles on, I muzzle the nozzle
Cappa taught me The Pillage, I'm a RZA apostle
At the tip of your tonsil, yeah, I'm gripping the magnum
Pure physical fitness, when you Enter the Dragon
Yeah, I'm awesome and handsome, the way I scribble my riddle
Sounds'll rattle your limo, can't handle my dribble, bimbo
