U.D.'s, yeah, yeah


We grindin', down to the bone, my name grounded in stone
Admist the founders, we loungin' with chrome
And mix the finest, we down to this home
Hit the housin' or roam
Shinin' like a hundred thousand in stones
Move mountains with poems, got a jones for Deniro
1-6-0, my zone, we throwin' elbows
The hoes bling, sure thing, we known kings
Only dime types, with minds right, we chose queens
5-0 sting, they want me thrown in the bing
Cuff me up, fuck me up, still your boy won't sing
Authentic like the U.S. mint
The hood hear me like when two techs spit
Seen me movin' in the blue S6
With some new red kicks, and a few ecst' hits
A ounce of purple and some Wu head chicks
Make the Planet Rock like Baambaata, the mad doctor
Bad momma slit that ass out the Prada
Hit the jackpot, slots for grands in Nevada
Pop a brawl like Muhammed and George, and Kid Sha-Sha


Since 12, I've been damn near grown, so I'm scared?
I'm gon' fuck niggas, Cashmere knowin'
Past year, showin' gray hair, beards
I bares arm, lost fears in the modern day 'Nam, my tears gone
Prepare, it's on, now that hibernation, street violation
Creep while you faking, study your card, niggas is fraud
Fuck that shakin out the don, I spit for a nation and spit it hard
These shots from abroad, they hit your car
It's war when the jails from the four, blow through the door
And hit your broad, I draw like an artists, hard target
Get the job, start to the finish, if I gotta die
Let it be, gettin' high off the spinach
Chase it down, H E Double N Y, with Guinness
Dedicated street chemist, street image
Stick to heavy metals like a magnet
Rip automatics, spit rapid at your cabbage
Flip faggots backwards like a mattress
Drop bodies like a bad habit, it's Cash, ya'll niggas
Will slug ya'll niggas, yeah


Yeah, yo, we can stay, back to back, while we handle these tracks
Or like when your raw, back to back, handlin' gats
The finest in guns, a submachine repeatin' it's claps
Prettiest sound, deliverin' rounds, destination
Layin' anyone down, coroners essemble your scraps
Burnin' them down, whose turn is it now, yours perhaps
This shit is a rap of riddles or mummy, like rubberbands on money
As the belt embrace the gun on my dungeries
I worry not, and look for a dealer to hit the block
If the rap game fail, the streets always got
Perserve you a spot, like what goes up, it must come down
Fuck if you accepted or not, knahImeman?
These raps stretch out like Yao Ming
Took block shots, whose blockin' your goal? It's La, me
It's hot, always rollin' that la-la-la-la green
That la-la-la-la green, that la-la-la-la green


It'll only take ten to destroy you and your men
Mr. Tokeback, strokes, ain't a joke to the end
Who can swim low and sky dive high, against mine
In my prime, Optimus shine, the booth be the bottom line
Fine as wine, get to the point like a porcupine
Throwin' gang signs, slittin' dimes in my spare time
Crime doesn't pay, as far as they say
Shit, let me tell it, I got pain every day
Which way the mix D.J., he play what I play
Most rappers can't rap, so they say what I say
How you gonna lie and try to deny
It's the Art of Dart Throwing...




INS Your Highness
Wu Tang, 7L
Eso, let's Go


Bustin' ain't nothin' to us
I spit game like a sportscaster
Cousin is crushed, you're lovin' the rush
Beast mode, animal house, straight off the intro
Sit back and watch a cool G rap, this is a demo
Menace with the methods, no sweeteners diabetic
Phys Ed raps, stretchin' 'em out, like calisthenics
Set it
Get wounded in the war like "MEDIC!"
No anesthetic, thus no medals for your effort
Fuckin' with this lyrical X pill, the vet's still a threat
He'll never defect, still I'm Destiny's Child
They Calling My Name
Come through, raw with the flame
Whoever want it get more of the same
Hold 'em scoreless, call it a game
All day, Sir I, get fly like I'm boarding a plane
Hard lines like the rhymes carved in stone
As far as the throne, see me anywhere
I'm not far from home


No matter how far we roam
We never that-that-that-th-that
Far from home
And we be right ba-ba-ba-ba-back
Guard your zone
We legendary like Guru and Preme
Don't you see what I mean?
No matter how far we roam
We never that-that-that-th-that
Far from home
And we be right ba-ba-ba-ba-back
Guard your zone
We legendary like Marley and Kane
Don't you see what I'm sayin'?

:
It's time to rumble with rebels
We rough and tumble and ready
We come up humble and steady
But flows are Money like Eddie
We blow your brains to spaghetti
Your lyric book to confetti
I'm fresher
You flow like the male version of Ke$ha
You're watchin' history happen like Jackie Robinson battin'
Or archeologists mappin' a path to fossils
Imagine Apache choppers attackin'
You rappers softer than satin
The beat is knockin', it's crackin'
Yo, this is Boston and Staten
While y'all be talkin' like a felon
Like you hoppin' out of cell and
While y'all be straight pussy like the opposite of Ellen
I'm Macaveli rebellin'
I'm Martinelli, I'm clearer
I'm Fonzarelli in leather
You Nas in Belly, an actor
You unintelligent rapper
You barely relevant factor
The hell that I'm propelling at ya
You can't develop or capture
Your skeleton will get fractured
I'll break every single bone
Esoteric's international but never far from home






We will fight till the night is done
We will live our lives tonight as one
We will live our lives tonight as one, one


I'm a bad mother, shut your mouth
Insanity, DVD, how I stretch 'em out
What the stress about? INS best out
Fact, you knew that before he left the house
Fresh at the produce section
Gaze at my shine like a showroom necklace
Death wish, stepping in Deck's direction
I'm checking niggas like test questions


Across 110th now, cross Belmont and Montauk
Camera hawk hawks the sidewalk
When they get to flexing muscle niggas bust you
Hustlers do you, gave you your first toolie
Cutting out of school to pump your first loose leaf
Think graduate to wait, take it out of state, duct tape
Anything of pulse and heroin
Emcees frozen, cuban link chains are golden
I'm ownin' everywhere I'm holdin' it up, to keep it raw
Math here, I got 'em keep coming back for more


Yo, man, I'm so turned up, all the marijuana burned up
Y'all don't want the drama, word up
The Wu first up, the game is the world versus us
Y'all was good 'til the world heard us
Y'all ain't want them Clan birds up
Y'all don't want your man served up, that'll get the fans worked up
Homie really wanna play, stir it up
I'mma catch me a wave, surfs up
Gliding on the track like this, make me wanna act like this
Make me wanna smack that trick
Make a killer really wanna yap that kid
If he opens up his yap that's it




Mass of minerals in a glass house
Playing 4th the Wu neutrinos will blast out
Letting out verbal thunder bolts
Until the world attract old and younger folks
Charge with the vitality of magnetism
In large reality with massive rhythm
The manual without technical part
From the beginning give off an electrical spark


I respect you if you respect me
Everything's for real, WTC
No fake ass shit, don't front the Remy
Break bread, never have pockets empty
Let's get it, flip it up then we can spend it
The money train, Killa Beez on your brain
W's everywhere, one on your chain
Homeboys for life, please don't change
You can hide at my house, it ain't no thing
If you see the pigs, don't say jack
Call me original, don't say cap
I'm on the low, might be at the murder
Holding off the place y'all cats never heard of
Yeah, chicks wanna peep me out
Nasty ass, want me to pee in their mouth
But now I'm out, about to link with sticks




Bang a few notes up top, we call it beast mode
Forget the street codes, show you like a deep throat
It gets rougher, you suffer from the heat stroke
Blast barrels, embrace my leaf smoke
Park Hillians radio for back up
Polish your act up, nigga need a back up
Syrup in my cup, no cut, straight up
UG's on the court, never miss a lay up


When the emcees came to live out their names
Some rode the bus, some rode the train
Some motherfuckers wish they never came
When they met the nine swordsmen of Wu-Tang
Nine Maseratis pulls up to this party hard
Body, the party is filled with Godbody
There out of shape models coming through with those bottles
And double D's please, all eyes follow
Pass me a bucket of ice, that's nice
Hit with the vodka, what you say proper
I drink with the copper, show up in a chopper
Stop her, she wanna have a mnage  trois
I can tell by the bra, RZA Ra-KZA-Keem is all is Allah
Do you wish or wish upon a star? Do you wish or wish upon a star?






What you sippin', ma? (What you smokin', huh?)
 Meet me at the bar
 (Got it by the jar, chea)



Camel on their Yankee sign, on the daily grind
New York state of mind, rugged, but my lady fine
Fly face, waist 8 or 8, rocking all the late designs
Stepping like, ya'll don't waste my time
On that Mary J., looking for some 'real love', say you both
Got somebody, knowing you gon' still fuck, plus dudes
Smother you, don't he make you feel tough
Why he suprised when he realize she feel cuz, really though
Daddy king size, with a mean stride
You ain't seen live, you fucking with these guys
She fly on the G-side, sex is a weapon
There's a .357 in her Levi's
What you sippin', ma? How you doing, huh?
The way you shine, girl, you looking like a shooting star
She by the bathroom, scope on the soldier hard
I pull strings, no guitar


What you sippin', ma? (What you smokin', huh?)
 Meet me at the bar
 (Got it by the jar, chea)

What you sippin', ma? (What you smokin', huh?)
New Ro (Roset) 

(Chea) 


Nothing but cases out, shutting tables down
Pay-per-view style, million dollar faces out
Hating ain't allowed, so played out, fuck
What they say about, I & I, what they saying now
I'm a General, you ain't earned a stripe yet
I'm the type to cop and go, ya'll the type to price check
Different colored cards in my wallet I ain't swiped yet
Man, I got a rack of broads, I don't even like yet
Yeah, I'm a rude boy, I ain't you, boy
I got the money and the girl and the cool toys
I"m confident and two boys, ladies call it ooh baby
Ecstasy, not the pill, true joy
Shorty got a thing for me, she be like
INS, you can be that king for me
Feel what I feel, hit the bar, have a drink with me
You say that shit, girl, but she say she only think of me, link with me

The burners and the stash, we 'bout the cash
We got females that got it like that
The golden childs that bone the crowd
See, niggas in the place that bit my style
Well, I'm a singer, dancer, we bulletproof brothers
Wu-Tang got the answer
Cause if I had a chance to do it again
I will still keep the heat in my pants-uh


Y'all be nice to the crackheads, everybody listen up
I shot one of my bitches, the ho ain't trick enough
Word life to big screen Don, tapping dustbones out
With starwriters like I fucked Celine Dion
Stuck everything that's the god's honest beyond
We airin' niggas out, that's the type shit that we on
Official Wu-Tang headbanger
Flood your space with big waves like you did in Sri Lanka


I drink heavy gallons of cru, play the big part
Niggas got squid on the grill, selling kids Clarks
Finesse notes, yo, the Guess on with the vest pose
Yellow swede one matching hat with the grey gun
Niggas be rhymin' for nothing, then my team pull up
We all throw down y'all broke niggas stay frontin'
Lines come digital stupid, plus ain't got no jewelry on
Bet I'm still live and I'm coopin'
Two of my silverbacks run through a pack of your wolves
Front on react, we're sippin' Cognac  relax dude
Know I'm with these cracks dude


Yo, 1-2, Dirt McGirt
Solid tone smith with 6th shots, lick shots
Leave your head like a Shaolin monk with 6 dots
Brooklyn Zoo, Zoo
Brooklyn Zoo


It's the return of Bin Laden, grab your armor
Smash pretty boy niggas, crush their karma
Eat bones with alligators, roll deep with my entourage
My whole crew's fresh out the bars
Diggler AKA the Cab Driver
Drop him off in the middle of fire
Dirty Island, drag bodies to the Murderland
Knock niggas out hurtin' my hand


I remember in the elevator we was playin' corners
Now we play the corners and the cops is stayin' on us
Staten's where the war is
Where the court system's running out of warrants
Where TNT be jumping out the Taurus
For real I can't call it
You see I love Lucy cause she Lawless
Exactly like that 1-0-3-0-4 is
Snitch niggas swallow your tongue
Already know the island I'm from
And y'all don't want no problems with them


We got a history full of lightning victories
Conceptual breakthrough, it ain't no mystery
Long vision from giants in every way
Rap czars, magnificent flows for every day
From the East to the 'ville, from the West to the hills
Incredible rhymes, encouraging skills
From rat packs, the smallest crews were enormous
We hit 'em fast with an effortless performance
MCs start fleeing in flocks
Especially those that's more sensitive to heat and shock


We grindin' down to the bone, my name grounded in stone
I'm Mr. Violence we loungin' with chrome
Mr. Violence we lounge in his home, hit the housing on Rome
Shining like a hundred thousand in stones
Move mountains with poems, got a jones for dinero
1-6-zero my songs we throwin' elbows
The hoes cling, sho thing, we know kings
Only dime dikes with minds right, we choose Queens


Yeah, we wild like rockstars who smash guitars
Yo son split his face with the toast, he ain't ghost
It's no joke iron coat rifle with the stroke
One toke brains float, shot to the throat
Before the smoke hit, witness the killing, chilling crime scene
Body on the block, eyes open from the shock
Of being popped in the neck
Yet he still held a lit cigarette between his fingers
Danger when you step into the chamber with the Masta
Disaster, gotta blast ya cause I have to


The rat pack is back from the island of Stat'
Leave you cursed dust, cause you worship the Gat
The first one to snap drunk off the Smirnoff
Blow the bouncer's ear off, let him floss he the boss
Handcuffed, to the turntables like Wizard Theodore
See it's pure, let it rain pearly ounces
Bang him with the thing that hang from the trousers
You don't want no drama, I'm flaming fast
That nigga jumped up and did the Damon Dash






Yeah, INS, yo
La the Darkman
Hit 'em with the death blow
Yo

Yo, I'm known to spit poems, throw dice and hold tones
Show ice, puff bones, hit beats like Larry Holmes
Through the Valley of Kings, you catch the Killa Bee sting
Tryin to pick up, you fuckin with the archbishop
Defyin me is like startin Rap World War 3
You rather sell your key to NYPD
My style's vicious, I rap in the lab and break dishes
My words wear jet black hoods, lookin suspicious
Darkman


Behold the struggle fire ultra harmonizer, track paralyzer
Artist he the real, blood spilled on the synthesizer
4th, turn it up a peak, make the speaker tweet
Iron Sheik camel clutch a beat, rappers take your seat
In fact punch a clock, it's my time to rock, dock the known like a scott
Engineered this thought that I present, so just
Comprehend, while I fill you in, with a bar or ten
And clear the path for the god Sin, do 'em in kid (Yo)


I stay lurkin, circlin the premises
Dart chemist sent on a search for arch nemesis
Concoctin neurotoxins out of synonyms
Send your physical in triple shock, crippled in a detox with no rememberance
While I rocks the maximum shows for no minimum
Capacity to pack the front row but flow naturally
Killin 'em, swing on the stage like jagged pendulums
And blow like thirty shrapnel grenades with no pins in 'em


Why risk it? Killah Hill District, we flip shit
Egotistic, I hold grounds with twin biscuits
Put it up, I lay it down, my streets sound surround
Shaolin bound, flash flood watch you might drown
Headliner, move through the city like a sidewinder
Island drifter, black vagina finder
Loungin by the seashore, switch like Bloody Roar
And slap hardcore dick to your main wiz, bitch


Toxi' on Bacardi Pina, low crawlin through Medina
Slumped in the seven-seater
Dumpin heaters, to bite might cause seizures
Weak MC's take me to your leader
We the true source, movin off on uncharted course
My thoughts come across with a blindin force
Killa Bees plant seeds, log on
Or get knocked off like a pawn if you dare lock horns


You are now in the 9th chamber
Where the falls of reality close in fast on the world of make-believe
And your fantasy is nothin more but a memory
Now bear witness to the realness
Shown and proven
We live by the sword...



*laughing*


The real hip hop is over here
The real hip hop is over here
The real hip hop is over here


Blue and white, Yankee fit, HG's, they the shit
A-list, the basic, the basement, the greatest shit
Prototype, show you right, high roller type
Fly over night phenom, recon soldier type
In the street, been a beast, industry entity
The remedy, my chemisty, the synergy, is meant to be
INS, Max Payne, pump through, the track vein
Make the move, act strange, fold 'em like, crack pain
Black bang, lick 'em down, guns don't, make a sound
Thirty eight, danger pound, everybody, gangsta now
I'mma ride, I don't hide, get mine, bottom line
Big time, papa shine, stop mine, you out your mind
D twelves, hold me dubs, females, show me love
Stunting, son? Know he was, blunted, son? Know he buzzed
Quarter G, fresh kicks, quarter P, fresh piff
Corner don, what I'm on, always be, that next shit


Pay homage, respect, acknowledge the rep
Niggas is this and that, I'm just the best
(Honor the vets, still causing a threat
Knocking heads, no problem to Deck)
Pay homage, respect, acknowledge the rep
Niggas is this and that, I'm just the best
(I'm INS, braveheart in my chest
I don't follow, I don't mob with the rest)


Killa Bee Part 3, RP Trilogy
Heartbeat, feeling me, pa be, still a G
Moshpit, mob shit, bomb like, Saddam hit
Armed with, the hottest shit, Human Torch, arsonist
Burn baby, burn it down, two step, turn around
Who that, hurt 'em now, Park Hill, murder town
Stat boy, that boy's, lord on the track
Boy, you 'roid on your back, boy, you 'noid off the track, boy
Franken-rhyme, monster mash, napalm, bomb the mass
Blaze a line, bong of hash, stay calm, start to spaz
Hit 'em hard, hit 'em up, heads nod, listen up
Split a dutch, bitch what, this is us, get in touch
Concrete jungle-list, stomp beats, thunderist
From on the streets, busting clips, to palm trees, loving it
Your highness, survivalist, wireless, pirate
My shit, ride for this, the cure for this, virus




Yes, you have now been taken to the dungeons of rap
Where the weak MC's don't make it back
You have signed your pact, with your fate
The dungeons...




Yo, this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
For all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it

Yo, in the housing, thousands seen early graves
Victims of worldly ways, memories stays engraved
All my live brothers, is locked down with high numbers
The young hunger, blind to these lies, they die younger
In this New World the Order slaughter men, women, and children
Ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in
The projects, lifeless like a vietnam vet
Constant war, sever threats of enemy conquest
Crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble
Streets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble
Vivid thoughts, Devils resort to trick knowledge
They kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars
I know the pain the game bring, I did the same thing
Spaced out in the staircase, performing a sting
It's hard to keep control, I bless those who seek a scroll
Trying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
Not a role model, I walk a hard road to follow
I sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
The gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole
Mentally they fold, and they eventually sold
Their life and times, deadly like the virus design
But too, minute to dilute, the scientist mind


You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way


A voice cries from the wilderness of the North
A representation of the families that lost one
All victims of incarceration
Or other divisions of the family structure
Youths are injected with serums that leads
To skin irritations, babies being born with
Disfigurations, experimentations
On their faces there bear worry-ations
Of mothers that carry the pain
Of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
Fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
It lightly begins to rain screams of terror
Are hidden by the passing trains
This can't be little Hussein, his uncle cried
As he drops to his nephew's side, holding his cane
Just give me a name, of who has inflicted this
Bitter sickness, and left us to witness


Yeah, yo
Curses from war, innocent blood spills for days
Soothe in godly ways, hands, solemn in praise
Tree of life, more precious than rubies, golden game
The wise shall flourish inherit, Halls of Fame
Crime visions in my blood got me, locked in prison
While we die hard living people whine about religion, vision
Blow, spin, and sin and killing what's revealing
It's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen
Zero process, progress, become the hunted
America's most wanted, good life flaunted, want it
Some love the speed, some satisfy a need
Some want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed
The strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed
One flew astray, and it caught my little seed
Can it be, the ice savage, trife life, made me grab the knife
The righteous man was beat with many stripes, pipes
Take in my energy, breath and know the rest
Cause the good die young and the hard die best


You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way


Y'all bitches love dances, and pulling down your pants
While your man's on tour, your spending up his advances
Your friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke, and suck dick
The whole projects is trapped in stench
You either high school drop-outs, one to three cop-outs
Fifteen years old, shorty ass and top out
Ninety-nine cent beer drinking pussy stinking
Fucking so much your ass and titties start shrinking
New World Order slave trade, minimum wage, Medicaid
Can a devil fool a Muslim nowadays
Inside my lab, I'm going mad
Took two drags off the blunts, and started breaking down the flag
The blue is for the Crips, the red is for the Bloods
The whites for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs
Or the slugs that ignites, through the night, by the dawn
Early light, why is sons fighting for the stripe


As we dwell through this concrete hell, calling it home
Mama say, take your time young man and build your own
Don't wind up like your old dad
Still searching for them glory days he never had
So many bad want to scheme for American dream, no more kings
The cash rule everything now, we going down
These babies looking up to us, it's up to us
The Million Man March MC's, get on the bus
But envy, greed, lust, and hate, separate
Though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
No longer, brothers, we unstable
Like Kane when he slew Abel, killing each other


You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way




"It has come to our attention that a mysterious force is loose somewhere in outer space."
"The mysteries of creation are there."
"Up in the sky?" "Up in the sky."
"The moon and the planets are there
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there
And therefore as we set sail, we ask God's blessing
On the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked."
"Prepared for lift off."


I Self Lord and Master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters shall be captured by Kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness
To blast ya, with a force that can't be compared
To any firepower, for it's mindpower shared
The brainwave causes vessels to circulate
Like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the father and Mother Earth
Seeking everlasting life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look listen and observe
And watch another Cee Cipher pulling my peeps to the curb
Heed the words, it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turning a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher
Thoughts will spray like street sweepers
Little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck plus the DJ you respect
The seven and a half combined, over the front line
The ten percenters promoting slander in the airtime
Bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp veins, heavenly praise and dues are paid


Above the crowds, above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual, above the clouds
Raining down, holding it down


I leave scientists mentally scarred, triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage
And catch a charge, shake 'em down like the riot squad
Invade your zone, ruin like ancient Rome
I span the universe and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah, rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Collossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust?
Who but us, to supply ya with the fire
The burning truth 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and mourn
But our hands are on the ammo cause the battle's still on
Sound the horn, we come rumblin' through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin'
When we die hard, they'll build a monument to honor us with
Humongous effect in the world, we could have conquered it

*It's what you wake up in the morning and it's who you are*
*You're listening to the world-famous Wake Up Show*
*We are controlling transmission*
*That's how we do it y'all, unifying hip hop nation*




Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long, any time she goes away


It started out east New York, where I grew up
Knew how to walk, favorite carry weapon was a 4
Older folks, smoked out stragglers, 
 bust three at yah
Dad fucked up consecutively
Him and some relatives were gangstas, sellin' pussy
Mom  on the spot, smacked me in the knot
Only thing he gave me was a name and a Glock
That shit popped, still that's me still, keep it real
Wasn't for him and the steel, probably wouldn't be 
 out, toned out
Three days away from home, stoned out
Coach 
Son I'm sendin' you home, nigga you foul
 half the niggas I run with




"What do you think of my powers now?"


Wonder twin powers activate
Form of: some fly shit
Y'all recognize
CZARFACE


He just air em out
He don't hear em out
He just air em out
He don't hear em out
He just air em out
He don't hear em out
He just air em out


He don't hear em out, he just air em out
He just fuck it up, it's like if really there's a doubt
The beat'll beat em down, it's leakin in your town
It's hotter than that summer time heat that's in the south
Hands up in the air, my fam up in the square
I'm Dirty at the Grammys, crash your glamorous affair
Spazzin' on the air, smash em with the flair
With the bad South American that's dancing in the chair
Get ya weight up, my pay stubs heavy like Dwight
Hens fight for what I said on the mic, put your threat on the mic
Ask around, clown, rebel is nice
Fuck your money, I said it for spite, son I'm ready to strike
Tear it down, I'mma tear it down
Them haters had a lot to say, I don't hear 'em now
I don't hear a sound, I just hear the crowd
I'm surgically performing like the doctor in the house




Put me on some anti-homicidal meds so I ain't got a lot of feds
Whip backs and spider heads, I'm Peter Parker by the ledge
This is ultra-violence, I'll tie em to the spiderwebs
Write forever trying to keep it together like whites with dreads
Heavyweight, that's what the title says, leave you limbless like a pez
You can suck my dick, beat my nuts, psycho les
I butcher beats like a psycho les
Every visual is Trent when he's bent, yeah, higher Rez
Out for the CREAM, we all about the dream
From Shaolin to the bean, y'all be bowin' to the team
And now we on the scene, they wonder how it's a regime
But check the howitzer, gun powder like marines
I'll smack ya face, bruise your ribs, crack ya legs, it's brutal kid
Stay ahead of snakes, like Medusa did, lose your wig
Act like you're sitting down to dinner, I'll remove your lid
Prove I'm big, air em out, we don't care who it is




"They pushed the limits of explosive power further than they'd ever gone..."




(Everything's black, black as death
I knew there was something wrong when I saw that light
Am I... Am I going blind? Tell me, am I going blind?)
House Gang, Urban Icon
Your big brother Deck in ya face
A/K/A the General Maximus
A/K/A Radar, A/K/A Excalibur
Sword Bearer, RZA, what up?


I keep a blunt lit, holding my nuts, dark Caesar cut
Throw some dough on the wood, things can be discussed
I stay thirsty, grind and play Dirty
Worthy like James, with Nikes and game jerseys
Third degree penmenship, flow is effortless
Make the mass congengrate, like they methodists
Specialists, I'm ya draft pick, catch ya flicks
Heads get right off of this, it's that shit
Killa Hill madness, we at it
Fantastic like the Four, it's automatic
Off with the hinges, when it come down to legal tenders
It's business, we get in ya blood with no syringes
Certified live, provide the dope side
Both coasts slide, my vibe is so fly
Sick kid, see me get big with six fig's
I flip wigs, let it be known, the kid lives


Here's a little story, that I got's to tell
About the R to the E, to the B-E-L
Dipped off the scene, niggas throught he fell
But now I'm back making heads spin like Sprewells


With the, eye of the tiger, like Stallone
I hit the microphone, my life can't be cloned by Spike Jonze
While y'all busy Being John Malchovich, ain't even bout it
Come out the house and see the streets, coward
With a fainted heart, make easy pray for the sharks
And bravehearts, bang hard, and aim sharp
On every block, something sold, is something cold
At ya back, so nothing's told after the fact
Yeah, I dwell where they bring the hell, kings'll fell
I try to leave the light, still my name ring bells
And I'mma be here for a minute, all in it
From the scrimmage, I was born with it, come on, get it
If you want it bad, we got automat's for ya fags
Take ya manhood, along with all you have
It's the Undadogz, hunger, dog, we run the yard
Dance with the wolves, and that's the fun part
I get my weight up, benchin' the world
Me, my man and my girl, thorough in my sec', reppin' my borough
Head shots of Henny, plenty broads in they cut offs
Send 'em on a date with your boss, when ya nut off, you done off
Blood lost, is more than a game, torture and pain
It's all for the fortune and fame, I said
Blood lost, is more than a game, torture and pain
It's all for the fortune and fame






I don't do it like everyone else
Check our pro, boy
The flow grab your soul like the devil himself
Always knew that I was headed for wealth
Young gun salute, the triple O, so the presence is felt
And this is for my diehard day ones
Who came from the same place I came from
Where you get your name from?
I earn my stripes, I write that
Eternal flame, type of shit that will burn for life, yeah
It's levels to this here, your's under mine
Cool J with the flow, ladies love the shine
I'm hotter than Sudan in the summertime
Verbal mind, now you must be out your fucking mind
Right, living it up, make the honnies hot
Boss, I listen up when the money talk
And never paid a thought to the dummy talk
Funny talk, that's hating what you love me for


All in together now
All in together now
All in together now
All in together now


You lack the minerals and vitamins native to my environment
I'm on the new level, true rebel, vibin' it
I'm loyal, I'm royal, and boy, it's a requirement
I'm more savage than below average, you don't have it
New wins for the team, and that's an old habit
Pro status don't met us, but crack your whole carriage
And I'm allowing the proud legally swing
The crown that I wear's a cow beef with the king
I'm technologically advanced, leaving a slang
Genius intellect, flexing on the demons to cling
I'm daily deadly, but I don't know who gave it away
It's safe to say that it's my victims, pray for my prey
Some of this ain't fun, the work is A1
I had a dangerous name since day one like James Gunn
But I ain't licking wounds, cause I know where the pain's from
So if you need a pic, you just allow me to paint one


All in together now
All in together now
All in together now
All in together now




It's not Jacob, but you can still call me the jeweler
You know how I throw that jewelry on you
And this one right here, this is just a tennis bracelet
You rock that with your white Nikes, and your white tee
Sunny Dave' style, ya'll feel me? Come on


I dreamed I was top of the world, watching the world
Awoke to a room full of smoke, gun at my throat
I dwell in the heart of the hell, but never fell
Po'nine scopin' me the whole time, they close behind
My wants just as big as my needs, so it's agreed
To strap up, tie these shoes, provide the school
A wild out, had to hide out, in China's house
Then run free, down to 1G, and hungry
I won't fold, from the chokehold, I broke molds
Fake ones, fake as they come, waiting to front
I fight if it cost me my life, toss me the knife
To move up, I do what I must, but who to trust
I came from the grain and remain mentally stained
The hardships, starving artist, it's obvious
I'm 'raging against the machine' to make some CREAM
That's how we live, just grab your kids, now we big
All up in The Source, we flip and win the toss
The law say, lock 'em away, vow to this day
The world is ours, we the loud ones at early hours
Striving, for a new way, my dues are payed


All I want is mine..
All I want is mine..
All I want is mine..
All I want is mine..


Yeah.. I mean, yo, we grinding out here
We got our lives on the line
We got oddballs watching us
We got fucking thieves, crooks, murderers
Gangstas, we got all types of shit we gotta watch out for
Let alone, your right hand man'll send shots to wet you, son
Shit..


My conscience beggin' me chills, steady we build
I ask, is it back to the cracks after the raps
Where I'm from, used to be fun, soon'll become
A deathtrap, mental setback, forget that
I'mma do this, for that all I am, call out a man
Black like Sidney Portier, boy, beware
The future's now, my superpowers could move the crowd
The road I follow, so far to go to see tomorrow
I'm close to the edge, my folks are mislead
Some, lose a step, lyric clueless, they choosin' death
That's the wrong vibe, the strong survive, known as they strive
Now watch me, top of the key, dropping a three
In my fate, the biography state, I would be great
For now, I milk the cow, build it from the ground
More or less, continue conquest hard as it gets
The promised land, ain't promised to a honest man
So, right or wrong, I'm fighting on this life long
Now let me live, set for my wiz and seven kids
I hit the block focus like Mr. Spock
And whether, rhymes or crimes, all I want is mines




All I want is mines, what they expect us to do?
They taking programs to a channel, man
You gotta pay to be locked up, you ain't getting no jobs
Niggas got three/four kids, four or five baby moms
No crib, living out they cars and shit
I got to get mines... then ain't no stopping
I'mma do what I gotta do, and I'mma rep for my set
My nigga Case rest in peace, my nigga, I'mma see you
The'll never take me alive, the'll never take me alive..




Carlton Fisk, could you please come to the bubble?
Inmate Carlton Fisk, could you please come to the bubble?
Inmate 96-8-42-95, please come to the bubble?
(Aiyo, what up?) Yo, you on the bailout (Say word!?)


I'm a fugitive, so I live my life on the run
Got Lebron's on, 4 or 5 clips in my gun
Police description, light skinned black male
For charges, so heinous, the D.A. request no bail
Shit, I'm out in the Coupe in Cali
Fake driver's license, Rode-o Drive you know how I do
Get 'em a shout out, baby girl, Animette with me to
And she not a chicken head, but Ani' known to cock a tool or two
In M.I.A., rock shades and a baldie
A.T.L., dreads under my fitted, long as hell
In New York, got a goatee and ice picked side burns
Iceberg sweats and some icy whites on
Don't sleep much, dream of all burnt mess halls
And P.L.O., never fell off, even though I was last seen
Up north, three balloons on your dance floor
Then I got deuces aboard, made my C.R
I'm home now, the question, what type, the color car
Get the S.C., 4-30 Lex', on some light shit
Pray it's not you on my mind, when I write this
Techniques, murderous speech, my thoughts is deep
Three felonies, fuck, we kill the police
I'm from Staten, you know how I do
Gummy sole under suede shoes, 36 ways made to blaze you
Made to blaze you...


I've been a gangster (for all my life)
I've been a hustler (for all my life)
I've been a criminal (for all my life)
I've been hated on (for all my life)
I've been a fugitive (for all my life)
I've been doin' this (for all my life)
I've been locked up (for all my life)
I've been a problem (for all my life)


Riker's Island in the '80's, Elmi' recession
Taught me how to move, and make anything out of a weapon
Old timers watching mace injections, how to deal with my problems
Using my mind, 'stead of using aggression
And this jewel is a learn hard lesson
How to move around places, every day and headed hard as tested
And you never get to know what rest is
Everyday your family pray, that you make your minimum sentence
Riker's Island, for the first time you get in the house
Hit the Beacon, you gonna know what jail is about
Plus, all the type of felons about
And the red I.D. card, on a nigga, mean, it's weapons about
Miss Perez on your dick, you better cum in her mouth
It come in handy, when the E.R.U. searchin' your house
From Up North to down state, Riker's and Sing-Sing
Attica, Snake Pitch, Gods, Bloods and Kings
Even Crips try'nna do they thing, but it's fucked up how
The fake niggas try to break they grain
Nigga, it's Carlton Fisk, I've been there, done it and seen it
And the few spots I've locked, I've put my work indecent
And we House Gang, P.L.O. Style, avoid the precinct






Hey wait a minute, man, what about me?
Hey wait a minute, y'all got
Y'all play a role in a racket flow
It was an act of God
I don't know what kind of act it was
I don't know how a junkie bust into my room and stole my TV
Hey, it wasn't me, man
Why ain't you out here arrestin' him?
Instead of runnin' him out
It was me, I confess! I confess!
Dead story, a respectable workin' person can't even walk 5 minutes
On the street without somethin' happenin'
All you cops don't do nothin'!
Junkier than police, one right behind the other with his hand out
Oh, baby, he's gonna get rid of both of you cops


Ayo, we always gon' hit heads left and right
We always gon' get dumb skets to fight
We always smoke and drink to set shit right
Yo it's always gon' be left, to we left the light


We always gon' be thug niggas and see drug figures
Always gon' be stuck on the block, fuckin' with cops
Always gon' get McGirts, liftin' skirts
Turn around and let the click just work
We always gon' be chasin' cash, racin' fast
Like we don't need life yo
It's always gon' be street life
We always gon' bank the dough, spank the hoe
Drink some Mo', you better act like you think you know
It's always gon' be Queens N.Y
Always gon' be scenes when men die
We always gon' be doin' time for doin' crimes
It's always gon' be in Riker's Island
We always gon' be "life is wildin"
We always gon' be puffed out, mobbed out
With your bitch gettin' dogged out
And the click gettin' slobbed out
Love between thugs, it's love between clubs
It's always gon' be, like the giddy, it's always ownin' me
We always gon' shake the dice, stay laced in ice
Talk the Judas down when we hate the price
Always gon' keep it funky
It's always gon' be grungy
We always gon' eat cuz we always gon' be Hungry
We always gon' grab the dick, try to bag a chick
And walk around with a grill like we mad at shit
We always gon' be in project hallways
Crowdin' up the doorways, drownin' up the Jorday's
We always gon' be naughty
Liberty bassly, forty, niggas be crazy, whodi
Always




Yo it's a..


....warnin', East New York niggas formin'
Beats say Bang Ya Head, Sister Sledge
War dance with the wild Apache Indian
Get Tom machine gun, fast car, big engine
Few squads for the back massage, head job
Then it's back to business
Murder one, leave no witness
Snatch mic, bash face and fight
Red light scope at night
Movin' through the Snow dressed in White
It's the ninja from the rooftop site
Aim for the brain, snipe from the buildin' across the boulevard
Hit him from a hundred yards
I just got a type from 'Preme behind bars
Peace God, you beat niggas up, I suppose
Sixteen metal machine I still hold
Shoot snub from ear lobe
Fortified rich with Twelve Jewelz of Islam
Walk humble and calm
Newspaper under the arm conceal arms


You want it rough? That Hellfire stuff?
Poisonous mics, yo make the party jump
Delicious, the funk, make your heart pump
Told ya, soldiers get over the hump
Your arms are too short boy you don't wanna rump
With U-God the grump, van, black truck
Ha, heavy on the grams, every man back up
Niggas act up, let the style spin
This is Knockout Kings 2000 again
Let the style in for a few proud men
Clifton Project, rugged grain Shaolin
Women in the bed, wolves are fed
Same Wu Chamber that Bang Ya Head
Aim with the stainless, hang like dreads
Dirty at the game but the same celebs

Chorus


Yo, yo, yo
Is it the hate that make me sip the Hennessey straight?
Then go and leave my enemy face, simply erase
Make me hop out the Benz with the Tennessee plates
Make me run up in ya house shoutin', "Empty the safe"
Or could it be love? Make be rock the hoodie and gloves
Wonder if Snoop wasn't Crip, would he be Blood?
Or maybe it's where I'm from, Bushwick
That got me wearin' my gun everywhere that I come
Why your chick got my pubic hair on her tongue
Uh-huh, if you wanna see the light, nigga, stare at the sun
Can it be my older days that gave me my colder ways?
Blowin' strays at your rollerblades
Whatever it be, that make me take your leather and flee
Evidently, livin' legal never was me


Yo we livin' it, lovin' every minute, won't quit it
Hollow points aim with your first name printed
In it for the money, never did it for love
Made a few enemies, couldn't limit the slugs
Never talk much, got ways of handlin' such
The enforcer, cause the police to rush
On the daily, rarely seen, often heard
You can spot me in the Hill layin' off of the curb
On the verge of snatchin' up ya crown and throne
While I walk through the heart of the Hell and call it home
Shao' borough Commando, style thorough
Wild like a convict lose on the furlo 


Oh baby he's gonna get rid of both y'all cops




Continous
Yeah, youknowhatI'msayin?
Wu-Tang
Aiyyo aiyyo, come on yo yo yo I'mma shoot over here
On that AIDS thing
YouknowhatI'msayin? I'm gonna just slide in the studio quick and get this done
Yo, yo


When you're sexually frustrated, plus waiting for a long time
You both had strong minds
Combined with feelings, she seems appealing, for each other
Discreet lover, no longer keeps rubbers
Smothered under deep covers
Erotic programs, Moet and slow jams
Enough to make you hold hands and plus you a bold man
You fall in a manhole, where the forbidden tree grow
And bullshit ego, of fly negro
Her garden sour, polluted with a dead flower
Months later, he's layin on a respirator
Depending on a generator, to keep his heart moving
And start losing sight in his right eye
In weeks he might die


I know this dope-fiend cat, word up, his name is Javier
Part-time shooter sharing needles in the stairs
Wise guys disguised as a fly guy, you getting high right?
Weeded up with red shit in your right eye
You's a menace, your brain cells finished
Begging forgiveness, calling that up top shit syphillis
You know what you was gettin into
Try to guess on what I've been through
Fuck shorty raw then she scared you


AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from the Wu, it's real
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from my crew, it's real


My nigga Chuck, he loved to fuck
Everything exotic bitches down to ugly ducks
Like Nancy, who liked the fancy tickles so he put popsicles
On her nipples to make her sex passion triple quadriple
Until she bust
Overcome with passion, big ass want lust upon him
But nigga he forsake to grab the condom
Fuck it, he said AIDS, was government made
To keep niggas afraid so they won't get laid no babies be made
And the black population will decrease within a decade
German warfare product against the dark shade


AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from my crew, it's real
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from the Wu, it's real


Caught by the gravitation earth rotation
Six in the sex is deep, when you can't see clear
Through the sheer brassiere, toke back
Smoking a spliff, sippin cognac, God
You know my two love songs, Bobby Womack tracks
Got her fat ass layin flat on her back


Yo, as she lay, she wore a silk gray neglige
Alize pours, the radio play, Marvin Gaye
What's Going On? As she screams Sexual Healing
Couldn't fight the feeling her legs hit the ceiling
Hitting all positions dipped in for quick love
She's professional, she does this shit in strip clubs
Flied in June until she Acquired Immune Deficiency
Now misery is the syndrome


Oh shit, God that's wild
Damn, that's some cherry flavor shit going on though kid
For real, knowhatI'msayin?
What about the exotic type
Caskets is waitin for brothers
Word up slide on the joints baby
Before you go to sex take protection
Word up

AIDS kills, word up respect this
America Is Dying Slowly (4x)

Yeah, word yo, sliding up in this store right here
I ain't even playing that man, for real
Dig it
Respect how I'm living kid
Here forever, word up
Lubricated joints, ribbed joints is bangin
But they still playing the hotel door man
Word, you know how that be though, you know how that be
Yo, just gettin to be too old
Chick over there lookin like Sonny and Cher
Over there
Yeah
America Is Dying Slowly
Surely
America Is Dying Slowly
America Is Dying Slowly
Remember that! Syndrome, be the resident
America Is Dying Slowly
Wu-Tang, Syndrome, be the resident

Noodles, Bobby Steels, Lou Diamonds, Killer Priest

Sunz of Man, Gambinos, forever...
Keep it safe!
Ol Dirt Schultz, word up baby
Protect yourself!
Keep it safe




Yo, peace
Yo, word


As I breeze through the isolated fog, on foot
The mind playing weary thoughts to the dog on one
Gone off shook
Falling off crooks, not enough books
Calm looks, watch your Mom cooks start to farm grew
The home that protect the rhythm march on his hooves
River turns red, dead carcass for the wolves
Gimme a tangible reason to rap with a thesis
You don't belong, like a man in the animal kingdom
Misleaded sheep in the era of fawns
The mind reach deep seated beat baritones
Pharaoh knows,  go cherish your folks
Embarrass your foes
The mind climb up Everest in treacherous snow
Day 2 sever the globe
Paid Dues better than Cole
Hate to envy the known
Without grasp, the outcast, denounce splash
Denounce bad
Try to pick up every lyric
On sonar to see how long your mouth last
Loud days, pace the mountain fast
Inmates in Alcatraz out for snatch
Found the path out the cell
Alarm sound, flash
Now to bail, jump the water
Guns harbour
Blunt starver
The town attacks
Lock the doors of the office ward
Officers swore to watch the law, but got deformed
By the men with government numbers
Terrible wonders
Unbearable nothings
Herald they bludgeons
Be careful to trust 'em
Feared stares, and they corner ya
Kidnap the baby, but forgot the formula
Cut the lawn, mom's gone
Showed up, killed the whole family, left the guard dog
Intelligent interface made to rule the world
Similar to girls, they love jewels and pearls




Marksmen Productions, House Gang, Animalz
U.D.'z... I.N.S., I see you, daddy (we on the rise)
Diz' I see you, daddy, hold ya head, B.S
Big Den, London, rest in peace Why Million


It don't matter if it's heaven or hell, dead or in jail
You put me there, and I'm all right (Animal rights)
It don't matter what hood, I'm good, any state, I'm straight
I'm getting cake, and I'm all right (Animal rights)
It don't matter what habit or ghetto, classic or metal
I got mine, and I'm all right (Animal rights)
It don't matter where you from or you at, nigga, front and get clapped
I stay strapped, and I'm all right (Animal rights)


House Gang clap together, wack whoever
Porsche Kayan, '04, the color of pepper
See you fronting when I pass through, my plate got cameras
I'mma House Gang, Animal, nobody can handle us
Roam the strip, quicker than ya Nextel flip
Run ya lips, I'm not the next to trick
Overnight, bagging extra clicks, war infered submachine
Extra clips, mini stash lab, extra kicks
I'm on G street, rolling the purple
While these little niggas pumping cracks, walking the circle
And some say I'm negative, somedays, and some way
I remind all these new niggas of the old way
Trey eight special, dirty lurking in hallway
How could I be scared to death, when I'm not scared of death
Bitch, I'm prepared to rep, yeah, either you ride or ya done, let's go




I'm an Animal, that kind that handle business for delf
So when it pop, I'm in the hood, like the engine itself
Type of nigga you can in the late night, black down
In the hood, in the hood, eyes red as a break light
And everyday I'm posted up, different jerseys or fitteds
You know the business, so I'm dirty as an open cut
Crack bombing the stash, black gats armed with the mag
That put you rap cats, moms in the bag
You hear the blat-blat, honor the flag
I stay strapped like a backpack, that's that, honor of Cash
My brother's keeper like a mom or a dad
La Banga, Raider Ruckus, Carlton and Cash, Rebel I sparking the draft
I was the baddest, but the smartest in the class
So ain't no smacking in regards to my math
I'm from the Staten, and I'm all right
All night, stacking my cash
House Gang, Urban Icon's, we got this in the smash




I hope you motherfuckers is ready, we handling heavy
Bats, ratchets, machetes, could assault you deadly
Which ever we choose to work, shit, you ain't ready
You hardly the worth the argument, you that petty
For fetti', I grab the ratchets, and, focus it steady
Come through with a murderous dart, recite on medley
I got rights to go bananas, ammo is heavy
I got the green light that get in that ass, like a wedgie
I'm liable to pop up where you won't expect me
My stealth mode, could get up on you quick like Freddy
And watch ya, facial expression, as the horror expresses
The moral of the story, should eliminate all questions
Hear the voices of my chorus, shouting out our rights
We about, our own laws, so we do what we like
Call it free will, our only concern is a weed bill
A moon is a big ass e-pill, fuckers, be real


House Gang... we making our own rules
Yeah, on the town, nigga.. walking out
Cuffs and ID's... let's go
Quiet in the corridor, we make noise
Raider Ruckus... Marksmen Productions
Coming, bitches...




I dont want nothin from none of yall
All handouts, no let ups
I dont need nothin from none of yall
Matter fact, yall got me fed up


See Im from another time
Im from another time
Im from another time
Im from another time


Live from Staten Island, black battin a thousand
On cash in a flash, call me Barry Allen
Slick fashion is sick, you know daddys stylin
Niggas take cheap shots like it was happy hour
The talkin is dead, its all for the bread
Even if the nigga cool still its off with the head
Never back down warrior bred
Rappers claimin they hot, I leave em cold in the coroners bed
Its the fifth brother, sick brother, pimp spitter with the grip rubber
Niggas hatin you bitch lovers
INS, Your Highness, scientist mind design the fly shit
Speakin of which, rewind this
Verbal intercourse, get off, go get your boss
Skywalker, how I hit em with force, still
Killa Killa Hill and Ill die reppin
Will Smith with the flow, I am Legend


See Im from another time
Im from another time
Im from another time
Im from another time


Me and the squad used to fuck up troops
While you clowns played duck, duck, goose
We dont shoot in the air, we sit em down like musical chairs
The shooters is here, fashion statement, Ruger the gear
I Buddha with peers, my classmates let the macs quake
Until you holey like a goalie hockey mask face
Flame torsos, we spray four Os
You rather get attacked by cane corso
I never let up (never) uniformed in the same getup
You fallin for the same setup
Gettin lured into my crazy hood
They say its good and rob ya, you get your whole frame wet up
For tryna cop a little smoke and get smoked
No empathy for the rich folks, they pitch coke
To suburbanites all about the murder life
Its murder city, you heard it right, Detroit right


See Im from another time
Im from another time
Im from another time
Im from another time


I got stripes like a Foot Locker uniform
You half donkey, half bird, like a unicorn
You a Pegasus, similar terms my dude
That means you hella bitch  Fizzy Wo said this
All that gang shit you poppin is irrelevant
I got some shit thatll knock down the elephants
Sole survivor of the crack house tenement
Hood resident, stuck in my element


The realest chapter that was ever wrote
Worldwide head nod offer pure dope
Sycronized, oozin eyes off of slick quotes
They religiously follow me like the Pope
So I aint sweatin the flossin, rap off-springs
Could never be Billy Danze, do that underball sting
Im the hardest nigga to spit it, I get it how I get it
And get it how I live it, its vivid, you cant fuck with it


I dont want nothin from none of yall
All handouts, no let ups
I dont need nothin from none of yall
Matter fact, yall got me fed up


See Im from another time
Im from another time
Im from another time
Im from another time




It was an evil day the sun glistened over the city
Shined bright though the window and the eyes of my kitty
I was reluctant, a ball In the pit of my gut
Like the phone call I got was just to set me up
She wouldn't do that, my love had love for the kid
So I slid on my wallows and bounced out the crib
Hit the block about 6 somth, shit got switched up
She pulled 'long inside and said, "Jump in the truck"
So I did, we supposed to be gone for Ziti
She made the wrong turn, I'm like, "Where you goin' to sweetie?"
Felt the heat on the back of my neck
Did a mirror check, I didn't know what to expect
I got knocked out and woke up in the melting pot
I heard the DeLucas laughin' and then shit got hot
They said, "Die Tony Starks, you gon' melt like a record!
Never to be remembered, never to be respected!"


Ay ay ayo, hold up, hold up, they said what?
Who said what?
They got Tony?
You serious?


Yo, I got word that my man got offed
Rolling with Logan, I told him, damn that broad
Its no surprise why she would do this
Word on the streets, she had a side deal working for the DeLucas
Word is out, APB, this bird is foul
Put a price on it  the hood searching her house
The DeLucas won't stop without merking us out
We should catch 'em while they celebrating, burst in the crowd
Tony death, shit is working me, vexed
They saying, "Deck chill, its real and you're certainly next"
Thrown into boiling vinyl, cant let it slide, fool
I guess it's just my time to die too
First find Logan, gotta make her talk
"Whos your boss, wheres your boss and who made the call?
Tell me or not, youre sleeping with the fish
But first tell your boss that he will get his"


And I told him 'bout that chick
Shit got me heated, man
Crazy, gonna kill someone
Still gon' pay, somebody gon' pay




It was an evil day the sun glistened over the city

There's no coke
What?
You heard me you dumb fuck, there's no coke
What the fuck do you mean there's no coke?
I've been up and down this ship
I've been in every fucking room
There's gotta be coke
There is nothing, nothing

*heavy panting*
Help PLEASE!
*panting continues*
Help me!
*gunshot*


It's assassination day, I stalk


I move through the Third World, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I live's a 25 to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
Cream is short, Cee Cipher Power stalk, plus the fiend talk
3 Gs the cost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen goal but it fail
Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter
Devil's poisoning the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened
Trapped in deep water, gasping
I clash with the titans for my half on the action


I stop producers careers, the weak spot was the ears
Scorpion darts hits the mark, pierce the heart with silver spears
You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still feel this so you're living build tilted
MCs upon their axis, their body hazard tactic
Lactic acid, desert dry cactus, practice
You can never match this invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice
The mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches
Unforgivable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects more livable
Interchangeable, caution: flammable
My chamber is 99 plus 1  unnameable angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
We creep through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare


First of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don
Spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurging, merging in the suburbs
Using this just like an adverb, action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aiming like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pa
You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Holding like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high, yo Bobby
You hear how I'm shooting it like they blue tops
No, you won't play me like your lady
Pay me 380, spit it at you like a baby, final destination Haiti


War's extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take things to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MCs to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue death than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in
Murderous rhyming, constantly inclining
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain then absorbs the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback






Do this, do this damn thing, yo
Ohhhh, yeah, I waited a long time for this
Word, cock back that shit, yeah, greatness
Ohhhh, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on


This is rap bizarre, another star in the making
Took lot's of patience, deep concentration
Sat back, analyze your M.C.'S mistakes and
Realize most of y'all rap cats is fakin'
Like y'all is serial killers, and ain't murderin' nathan
Funk Flex, pump this, in heavy rotation
Place your bet, whose the next rap sensation?
Mobilize, regulate, a whole generation
Fuck what ya heard, this is Street Education
Pluckin' at your nerve, like a stab wound patient
I feed blatent, styles still flagrant
Catch me on Rap City, loungin' in the basement
Style, still gritty, double dart agent
I master the art, check my rap pages
They stab you in the back, who that? Smiling faces
That's why, I carry the gat in foreign places


Rap bizarre, another star in the making (ohhhh)
Keep faking, get your seat taken (ohhhh)


Yo, inhale this paraphanel', dart from jail
It's P.L.O., see me up north in your cell
Plug your cherry rich Glock in hell, find your way out
Tunnel vision like we emburk, fight my way out
Niggas can't stop me, five seven seven tips probably
Serving me, enter my building lobby
Police recording me, yo, I got I.D
So on point, pass you a holder with three felonies
Verrazano, horizontal move, first that gave him rules
Niggas can't fuck with P.L.O., for real
All that shit sound slick, but let's be for real
You a faggot life nigga, that just caught a birth
I'm the raw suspect that'll tuck your eighth
Pistol whip you in the face, make you crack the safe
Man, you can front all you want on cd's and mixtapes
P.L.O. Style, niggas had to earn they name




This is Shaolin, what? Niggas grab your nuts
Strut, rock to, what I conduct
After this verse, I might self destruct
Short fuse, overheating, blow the fuck up
Where my ladies at? What up? Wanna fuck?
No disrespect, got a love jones for sluts
Big bag of dud, Deck, burn a Dutch
Fiends control your lust, look, but don't touch
Still Wu, keep the God-U, tucked under the gut
Rap lust, my flow is spectaculaus
Niggas doubt my skill, like I ain't real enough
Fuck what you feel, that's why you still baggin' up
It be those niggas you know, that be actin' up
That's why my attitude's corrupt and don't give a fuck
Fans rush the bus, to get star struck
I'm that same road, he's just loungin' in cut




Word up, word up, Streetlife, Size/7
Get ya shit taken on the spot
Rebel I (word up, be on starter)
Wu-Tang, Killa Beez nigga (who request that?)
Forever (word up, ohhhhh)
Yo, pass that bone (you know how we do)
(Word up, Killa Hills, Shaolin, Shaolin, ohhhh)




Astonishing how I flip a mic and start bombin shit
Varnishing, paint on the wall with knowledge and
Wisdom, one, two, dip em in the holy water
Rip it in the holy war, check em into post mortem
Document, fresh direct Ralph Lauren hoodie
When I be on the West Coast rock with 
The limelight fry em like five-fifty Fahrenheit
Fire mics daily with ninety-nine terabytes
Bangers, I pop up with new angles
In the maze, navigating this game, so far made loose-
And dead-ends, crystal mint, James Brown, there it is
Walking it, talking it, making it all connect
Through instinct, full of god, Iron Mike in the straight
Mosey up and away, grab your rosary
Hoes be all up in the mix tryna cake off
Or be left with crumbs in the end while I take all


Im straight boss, wave of my hand I make em break North
Im paid off, something like Bernie how I made off
Yours truly, got em jumping like the horror movie
Shit your groupies move to couldnt hardly move me
Im that Beat Street Ramo with fuego
Pounds or pesos, dont matter its all bueno
Pay close attention, mention my name: provoke tension
Bets in the game, theres no question
This is Marco, Rebel on the job with the Large Pro
Lords of the Underground marked with the barcode
The Dark Knight, eyes on the city
Dimes on the sticky, overtime on my grissy
Mind on the moola, doola
Stepping with the superfly cougar and the personal Ruger
Im through your brain like Hennessy black
Flow dawg, Im a menace to rap, but stretching your crack


"Create astonishing lines"
"The flow is something amazing"


Similar to Eastwood, roll in the gauntlet
Bulletproof bust but shots get to sparkin
Create an idea, if theres a problem I solve it
Maximize brain cells, glitter like garland
You cant out-rap us, twenty-plus years been at this
Large Pro, I-N-S above average
This aint fire, this is arson
Big guns pointing at your toes, got rappers doing the Charleston
Breaking atoms send a spindle round your dome
When I hit em, if I need help to Deck I shine a Wu emblem
M-Polo on the boss for dolo, whippin it like a Volvo
Picture this like a group photo
Its a team effort, no need to fly solo
Bear witness, crown over mine, this would be the logo O.C
By design it was in the terrace
Simple A-U combined make it eighteen karat


Gold bars, Libyan money, bloody the nozz
We the verbal gods, blow heat, discreet just to beat the odds
Exotic lodges, mnages, Khadaf is
Single-handedly murdering soloists and squadrons
This is vernacular, my poetry is spectacular
Bram Stoker choke the vocals of an amateur
Attack like terrorist plot from Afghanistan
African, we a pack of wolves, yall a rack of lambs
Seven-and-one-half ounces of grand thoughts spilled
Im like a shark with venom coming out of my gills
Behind enemy lines, ready for war still
Rhymes like extended clips spitting out of mack mills
Benevolent martyr, all my Gs scarred up
Mastered the art of these bars, word to the Father
Indigenous pharaoh, my thoughts travel
Like a hollow-tip through a barrel
Watch a universal battle
The magnum opus wholl split an atom when he focused
We the titans in the cypher, yall a bunch of roaches
Travel the Matrix in a time-portal spaceship
Visions of Euro stacks, better where my face is
Champion hoodie, shell-top with no laces
Queensbridge houses, nostalgic, most graces




Yeah, House Gang, what the deal, family?
It's been a long time comin', long nines bustin'
Get the stack and all that, we gotta let 'em know where we goin' man
Cause we the future, ya dig?


Ask around what's fuckin' with them
Live niggas stack G's and believes keep a couple a spin
Know my team don't front or pretend
Made men with control like Frank White, musclin' in
Nah, ya'll can't run with the great
Throw my name on the scale
Son it's king size holdin' it's weight
Got a taste for them donuts and cakes
Got wolves with they tongues out, droolin' all over your plate
Keep a 4 or 5th long and a whip, if ya'll wanna flip
In the kitchen stay ballin' a fix
Boy you act like you strong in the pits
But up north, got your manhood took, right along with your kicks
Boy, you lived under the wing
Got robbed by the C.O.'s, Bloods, Crips, Gods and Kings
Ain't neva seen the box in the bing
Find out it was PC, weak niggas rockin' ya bling
I never said I'm Nino Brown, but for mine
For all means, cousin, I'mma squeeze those rounds
I lounge whether B low down, in the street with Street
Playin' C-Lo, with c-notes down
Boy, Brown knows I played your role
Salute the Gene-ral, and don't violate the code
My footsteps shake the ground
In my cypher, no snakes allowed
Cause your ways are foul, boy
You heard us comin', didn't make the sound
What, you gangsta now?


Cause we A.W.O.L., Animal Way Of Life
And we hungry in the jungle, don't lose ya life
Cause we A.W.O.L., Animal Way Of Life
If you live by the gun, you might die by the knife
Cause we A.W.O.L., Animal Way Of Life
And we movin' with a army, don't loose your stripes
Cause we A.W.O.L., Animal Way Of Life
And we hustle everyday and night, like everything aight


Eyo, I'm stickin' to the streets, I'm addicted to the streets
Violate D, nigga you be stickin' to the streets
Head in the ground, I listen to the streets
Head in the crown, I'm here now, what was missin' was me
But they ain't want me all over the track
Said the flow too dope, leave a monkey all over your back
Now I pump it all over the Stat, if I ain't holdin' the mac
Then pump a dump and leave a hole in your back
I got the streets in my veins, the beef and the pain
Snowstorm, hail, sleet and the rain
Son I move the snow by the O, peep the piece and the chain
Reach, I put the piece to your frame
I'm sprayin' ya'll from deep, cause the aim
Y'all playin' like the streets is a game (Animal Way Of Life)
And ya'll hatin', cause I'm capin', always speakin' my name
Cause I ride around shit and tore the seats in the Range
Feelin' froggy nigga, leap for the chain
What I do to you, will take a little more
Then this beef to explain, we all dogs but you easily tamed
On the wall, we can easily bang
Draw four, then I'm leavin' the game
Like what for? Cause it ain't even a game
Let the force, Swiss cheese up ya brain
Walk my dogs on the street with the cane
Call the law, I ain't easily tamed
It's House Gang, and we leadin' the game




We hold the drama, dramatically when rap unfolds
It's welcoming, young with open arms cause youth is bold
And aspect, asset, that be wisely known
Whatever's been reeped and sown, the best beef is unshown
Live from the battle zone, quiet weapons get blown
With silencers, from the dust to the crack of dawn
Fake done came, and real done gone
For every death, one's been born
That's the square, reality ain't never been fair
But we face it, sins against the Ten Commandment basics
With killings, and duct tape the bodies in the basement
Miles gagged and laced it, this live niggas keep shells
With none wasted, with four niggas play it's close
We keep it toastess, gripped in the leather hostess
Keep your vest jacket on for them cold shoulders
Ya'll friend niggas be them same niggas turnin' cobra
Learn what I told ya




Carlton Fisk is lucky, I ain't robbed you yet
Want a hundred shot revolver, they ain't made one yet
So I settle for the red beam that silence the tech
Make a movie, House Gang, nigga reppin' my set
For every barrio, hood rat, and King Trinidadio
Blood Aruby, Crip to Scooby
Fuck a G.D., we all one gang, please belive me
It's just the Animal Way Of Life, stroll the strength
No man will hold the fifth
Before you quit, like brrahh nigga, holy six
Carlton Fisk, oh I know that nigga, heard he sick
Plus he H.G., U.D., know they rich
Glow on his wrist, look like a MTV Crib
This how I'm livin', Donald Goines in the state bid
Live wire, you a if, and, or but nigga
Because you a homo-thug dick in your butt nigga
Wanna talk cash, it's aight with me
Cause I know that ain't nothin' in this life for free
So let me know what you got, so I could roll up
Let me hold what you got, froze gold with the rocks
When I come through your block, I'm live in stereo
Here we go, and for any scenerio, we never worry
Carlton Fisk nigga, and I'm known for the drop
West side highway when I'm stowin' the cop
Blood in his mouth, 'till my homie tell me to stop
House Gang, hide now mothafucka, drop down, or you shot




Cuz we AWOL, Animal Way Of Life
Raider Ruckus, Animal Way Of Life
Donnie Cash, Animal Way Of Life
I.N.S., Animal Way Of Life
La Banga, Animal Way Of Life
All my fames, Animal Way Of Life



"It's true - the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang, could be dangerous!"


Uh-huh, Mr. Biggs, Trackmasters (woo!)
It's a Wu-Tang official right here y'know


Yeah, the employees of the year yeah we're back to work
We took time off, while other rappers got jerked
Shit's bout to change now, it's a shame how
Things ain't the same but I'm back in the game now
And as we step in the door, we cause panic
Yep, the usual suspects, we at it
Vet status, y'all went a week with the belt
Few chicks felt your style, now you feelin yourself
Meet your maker, I dropped you at eight years old
I got stock in your flow and crops to sharehold
Crops with the prose where cops won't dare go
Got top centerfolds too hot to wear clothes
Still me - always have and will be
Ill G - it's silly to hate but feel free
Hey - hear what I say, they gotta pay
And my return is like Christ, declare the holiday


Back in the game now.. copped me some weed now
My people bout to eat now.. shit's bout to change now
Back in the game now.. all my niggas in the hood now
Better catch up now.. shit's bout to change now


Uh, y'all see I'm in the street strugglin
Young dumb and thuggin, give a FUCK about nuttin
Stuck at rock bottom, tryin to come up on somethin
Pumpin from sundown to sun-up, we hustlin
Vision my nigga now get in where you fit in
And see prison, as just the high cost of livin the life
Ante up cause if you blow the dice
On that O-Z, Dorothy ain't goin home tonight
That's on e'rythang, put it on the kids and the wife
Been buryin my folks ever since they raised the price on the coke
Searchin for a quick antidote
Mo' money, mo' problems to cope


We were at the same table when the chips were checked
A gamblin +Rebel+ who +Inspects+ the +Deck+
Just when you thought we would fold our hand
Against all odds we raised the bet like we changed the plans
It was live on air but in between station breaks
I was holdin a pair and just made the table stakes
Split the demos, put insurance on tapes
A safeguard against the crusaders in capes
If I double down they say the Gods are sharks
If we win against the house they thought the cards was marked
We draw hit after hit from a royal flush menu
While the dealer promoted the full house venue
A spade in the club with the heart to wear diamonds
The high roller who got credit upon signin
They look puzzled when I shuffle, most of 'em stunned by the hustle
Recourse of bluff game's your muscle

 - 0.75X
 Say what? ("Shaolin shadowboxing!")
 Shit's bout to change..


Aiyyo, on rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich, coolin with a mean ill Jamaican bitch
Banana coat matchin with the ratchet
Lil' black weave sweatpants style, air force is actin
Jump in the 6, kicks look crisp, talkin bout the bird
Flow through your hood in the mean tints that's giant
It's like the family that flipped on you for lyin
Buried you alive, left your whore cryin
We on your floor look more doors
Dey ain't ate either, I hope y'all niggas is armed
And when we get there, all my niggas in the mix
Yeah Shallah Lex, Diamond got me buyin Louis Rich wear


Most people say the Clan was missin since I got dropped offa radio
Overnight your whole style was bitten in the process
Everybody switched they names like
Whatcha call it, any fast (?)
It was the Gods that repped that, sharkskin dark skinned bitches
Clarks from Digi left the game dizzy
Ooh got busy, that dancey shit slid through
We had to stay hood cause that's who we been through
RZA came through, mastermind got the cash and power
Proof that power plastered divine classical lines
Mathematical rhymes, the style is unbearable
Now niggas with the radical shines
It's Ghost-Deini, every coast need me
We back motherfucker that's right, it's the W.T.C
World Trade Center, Wu-Tang Clan
We brought so much heat that we was givin you tans an' shit








On a man-made lake there's a sheet of thin ice
Where unskilled skaters couldn't figure-8 twice
That's sixteen uncut direct from the cult
Head on assault, the result death by the bulk
In a vault, they spoke about the average loss per mission
That was seen by a king in a prophetic vision
Like a plane crash from a bomb blast
Special broadcast, slot time with con cash
They kept the jury quiet and now the riot will form
While satanic man now hang in his dorm
I swing on you fake radio personalities
Who boost ya ratings with hypes behind casualties
And fire shots with low-pressure water gun play
But instantly slap ya five like it's Palm Sunday
I fashion the first tool, from the elements the Earth use
And built it to a complex network of communications
You're up against a hopeless situation
I screen every vehicle from enemy observation
Swarming unpredictably, we spread terror
Increase the fog significantly, change the era
Check my wind pattern, it's heading west
Success is freedom but failure can mean death
Humans sweat and aim shovels, dig up the debris and rubble
Permanent damage caused by the W
Now who cowardly urge you to merge through
And think the workers will serve you?
The Sonic marvel who just dropped the next novel
Worldwide, rapidly marred in marble
It's a countless amount of emcees I saved
And them same niggas wanna squander those gifts I gave


Scratch underneath the surface, where does your purpose lie?
It seems our will is worthless, like we're pawns beneath the sky
Fates erased by reason and passion's just a whim
Feel empty so I breath in, keep myself from giving in


Love and hatred, moments most sacred
Both species, they lay naked in the tombs of oasis
Think back on niggas I ate with, spent the day with
Guns we played with, niggas I relate with
We broke bread, I heard through a vine niggas worked for the Fed
Sent out secretly to take my head
I laid back and meditate to the words they said
Skipped town for a month and grew some dreads
Had a friend tell my family I was dead
Returned at the last fall of the autumn leaf
Operate the plan accordingly in case the Feds are recording me
Sign all documents using forgery cause just a mere thought of me
I'm like Solomon, spoke bluntly, told the world, "I'm black and comely"
Howls from the grave haunt me, the smell of death's upon me
I dwell in the Hills like Gandhi
Been in the presence of mad peasants and old kings
Who sold everything on a quest for God's Divine
Slept in caves to get a clear mind
Who prayed three times, when the Moon lit and when the Sun rise
I met dwellers in the desert, talked to shepherds
Been in the mouth of many leopards
Felt the death kiss of Satan's mistress
Walk through vacant districts, before religions I studied pagan scriptures
True philosophers and physicians on the cure missions
Who harden their hearts toward the weak, sick and inflicted
Candles lit, gamble with a bitch
Who made me love her when I touch her, soft paws hide claws
Bees with sweet honey in they mouth
Have bitter stingers at they tail
Walk through the chambers of death, take a hole onto Hell
Embracing her was like embracing the third rail




Scratch underneath the surface




Yeah, yeah, yo


We pray for a better today, Glocks and berettas spray
Everyday, how did I survive yesterday?
I can't call it, cops shot the alcoholic
The fiend saw it, he got the gun, he want a dime for it
The hood life, chicks and thugs, crips and bloods
Dippin' on the judge, pushin' whips and drugs
Burnin' big buds, gettin' love, spinnin' them dubs
For the taste of it, the low lifes'll split your mug
It's the home of the brave, the zone of the slave
We all want it, but gettin' it's, a whole 'nother page
The young guns wantin' respect, flossin' the tech
Bitches wanna strip, now it's all for the check
Yo, everyday, lives at stake, pies to bake
Same knife that cuts your throat divides the cake
For the hustlers, thugs, who scheme to survive
And all in between, scream "Fuck a 9 to 5"


In the bright lights, the big city
The thieves stay crawlin' at night, with eyes shifty
In the bright lights, the big city
The fiends come sortin' the price, with nine fifty
In the bright lights, the big city
They squeeze off, lustin' for shine and die quickly
In the bright lights, the big city
The streets take a whole of your mind, it gets gritty


Daydreams, bought and sold
The high price we livin' might cost your soul
Secret indictments, furrows, with roll hoes
Codefendant, I hope he don't tell what he knows
Exposed to a life of crime since I was nine
Gettin' money by design, despite the time
Hustlin' to be a man and feed my fam
My wife, my seed, my land, completes the plan
Please understand, either legal or scam
I see the thieves in the van, I can't beat the man
Still monster ballin', eatin', speakin' ebonics
Wit foreign cars, custom made clothes and chronic
Bank rolls and prophets, shine solar powered
Fine hoes that's bout it, long as you keep they nose powdered
Obey street laws, careful what you say
You can play, but you might not make it through the day




It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from goin' under, I'm used to gettin' over
I'm deep in the middle, indeed the heat sizzle
For the littlest beef, even the seeds keep pistols
Foreigners talk funny, friends they want from me
But all I need is long money and a strong honey
I need it "fast", I'm "furious" like Vin Diesel
I'm lookin' at my plate wit food for ten people
So, do what you gotta do, do what you want to
The blocks hot like a sauna, cops try to pawn you
The fiends trick you, dude behind you wanna get you
On the grind, your best friend'll talk for a figure
Walk wit a nigga, see it, don't talk about it, be it
Don't walk around, then beat it, we all bound to feel it
This ain't the town (for real), so watch your tour (that's right)
What's goin' down (what's up), its poppin' off




Gritty...




*sounds of fighting*
Stupid fool, you're forcing me to kill you!


Yeah, you know how it go
Fresh from the stationary hall of justice
Real rhyming, real movement, real life
Word up, we just chilling, ten bottles of Krug on the wall
Youknowhatimsaying? Straight up, for real
Yo, RZA, talk to these niggas, man, let's go, man, for real
Yo, Rah, what up? Let's go, yeah, gangsta shit, groovy shit
Raw shit, secret indictment shit, yeah
Secret indictments, be careful, niggas
For real, let's go


You better get that money, no matter, what you do
You gotta get that money, and represent your crew
And keep it true


As reaper stay sprayed, still niggas is smoked
Four in his pocket, a diamoned up chain and some coke
Champion hood, the goodies in a brown bag, by the radiator
Near the cookies and the bundles of dope
Fishscalers, I live in elevators and gross
All this paper, profit make her lay there and post
With them Adidas that Bruce wore, stay in the juice bar
All I know if you saw me, you thought I was broke
Black, yo, I been hustling since niggas was busting guns
And scuffling, and jumping niggas over some coats
We play the S&S rooftop, Latin Quarter, Polo popes
Who hung out with all the Eighthers and GOAT's




Yo RZA, you crazy man
This that Black Mozart shit, right here


Yo, I used to scramble hard, radio strapped, to the handlebars
Fifty deep, in the lobby large, rocking camouflage
Dark Caesar holding my nuts, played the building front
Fifth of Henny, throw a little snow in the blunt
Just growing up, schooled by O.G.'s, holding O's and up
Daily new drama unfold, they popped 'em over, what?
It's so rough, nobody know him, so what?
Aiyo, the money's close by, homey, show me the stuff
Borough hopping, copping bricks, bags, burners and kicks
City slickers, circling the strip, working them tricks
Like friday night cruise in the Coupe, new valor suit
Fruit flavored kicks, taking flicks out in 40 Deuce
Farmer jeans, hammer swing, tucked in the loot
How they hit Miss Fisher, they was busting at suit
Up in 54, underground, parrot and Q
Made man with the grey shams, wrapping the boo
Stay flam, every day, fam, stacking my loot
Eighty grams in the cake, bam, packages flew
Sipping passion fruit, Alize, in back of the Ooh


We soldiers, boy, we soldiers
Bake cakes, hundred dollar bill holders
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers
Bighead, I thought I told ya
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers
Bake cakes, hundred dollar bill holders
Bighead, I thought I told ya
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers






Once again I gotta take a nigga head off for not believing
So be it... yo...


Intro to outro, bout it, fo' sho
Prime time, with the pros, hoes out of control
Fine wine with the 'dro, I don't powder my nose
Wise guys in control, show them how to get dough
This is S.I.N.Y., now you know
The fugitive on the strip, with the pounds of 'dro
Cast arm, strong arm, hot rounds of blow
La Bang', with the snub aim down your throat
House Gang on the track, now you're menacin' through
It gets rowdy, allow me to finish your food
U.D.'s in the kitchen, with the sinister brew
Makin' million men march like Minister Lou
Spike Jonze couldn't clone my life, I'm Deck Malcovich
I'm countin' my chips, diggin' out a bitch
Dippin' in a powder six, splittin' cigars
Hold weight like the bench inside the prison yard
The Hill to the grill, nigga feel the God
New kids in the biz, better kneel to Czar
2-4, H.G.'s, U.D.'s, the family
Hittin' like a thousand milligrams of E
Stay gone on the ziploc baggies of charm
Knock you out with the word play, daddy, it's on
Suicidal like a Shite, carryin' bombs
To make more Pulp Fiction than Sammy and John


Sammy and John, nigga get out the way
Let's go, yo, check it, yo


Yo, I'll be tryin' to as much as I can
But I know it's war forever, ever since they met my fam
They got shook, and then organized the plan
Constructed for me, all just to have your jammed
Don't want reward, double wise man, as long you'se on top
Niggas target you always to be where you stand
My calibur is royalty in the eyes of the broker
And most likely you'll vision me whenever they smoke
Livin' thoughts of my body, lyin' in bud surplus
It's vice versa, but I don't have to kill
Ya'll niggas is birds and'll fly before I will
All I'm waitin' for is to score, one live deal
And enrich my rhymes, so every line is worth a mil'
And when achieved, your bars add up to them billions
We all live niggas, poppin' our collars, but never chill in them
We cold current around us, it's ice in our jewels
You feelin' us, life we dealin' to bless us
As long as we preparin' our children, understand me?
Feel me, the extra clip in my sock, for war, came in handy
Chromie nine will grip, the screws is even sandy
I co-ordinate, twist the wrist, plus I'm fancy
From N.Y.C., to Cali, that's how the stance be
You Hollywood gangstas, y'all acts on camera, candy
You fraud-fakes, I'm real, and that's what enhance me
That's my battery, that's my energy bar
That's what motivates me, most to rush ya squad
But ya'll intent, to pretend like ya'll holdin' it, pa
Soul hearted niggas, that all of a sudden become hard
I never heard of you, over night murderers
Fear when I bust clap, we robbin' your heart, the current burglars
Bring it to your town, late night, with the block disturbers
Get that cake right for all you, late night service
I break car, stole west murders, now that's service




Ayo it's war on the street, blood on the cobblestone
I leave 'em buried alive, just like a fossil bone
Body bags line the streets, reporters reportin'
Mafia ties, drugs and extortion
DeLucas vs. Stark-iano, headline the news
Police pull war on crime, they're gonna lose
Judges get kidnapped, captains get decapitated
Starks rise above all to be emancipated
Black Godfather, families at war
Drive bys and Molotovs settle the score
Butcher shops are filled with chopped up casualties
I made sure to keep guns in all my faculties
The streets run red when the bosses disrespect us
Neglected, I guarantee no man's protected
To each his own, grab a gun off the shelf
Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self


Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self
Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self


How you prepare for war? Grab your guns and your hardware
Never close your eyes in the barber chair
The heart of a lion, that's what got him here
Bulletproof the car, yo, we outta here
Fuck the DeLucas, we've got shooters with submachines
Bone-crushing niggas like a football team, under a new regime
The old we throw it out, spin back the hammer, let the lord sort 'em out
Keep your gun cocked, at the whorehouse, sip the brown liquor
While we move a quarter ounce, pick the territories
Move north or south, the high power shine, yours is watered down
I'm underground, with the vest is on, open up your head
Now your flesh is torn, never turn my back up at restaurants
Put holes in your chest, come test the don
45 in my holster, let me stretch my arms




So the DeLucas want Tone? Nah, not today
Cock and spray, side with 'em and you've got to pay
Don't even kill 'em, just make 'em feel a lot of pain
Stake out his wife and his seed at the soccer game
Greet 'em with open arms, beat 'em with no regard
Feed 'em two two-threes, freeze 'em, leave 'em with no resolve
Make a lead on me, repping for the territory
No stepping on me, brethren that's a negatory
You want a war? These men pop dangerous
Taking all in a 10 block radius
Murder rate double, triple, cripple the strip
Like it got hit with a couple of missiles
8 will fly through your door, I'll get in your crib
In a wig, in a cable guy uniform
My shooters maneuver, we've got DeLuca in the scope
Moving close, say the word, Tone, dude is ghost

Like it got hit with a couple of missiles
Eight will fly through your door, I'll get in your crib
In a wig, in a cable guy uniform

Our most induring responsibility to future generations


They say God don't like ugly, blessings are upon us
Bush hated niggas, now the President's a brotha
Whether you in the gutter, or your residence enormous
That shit don't matter when death around the corner
Before your book of life ends, recognize the author
All praise due, things you do bring karma
Your seeds shouldn't eat cuz you beefing with baby mama
Will be the one you need when police raid the corners
Ain't nothing but niggas fronting, shitty drugs and drama
Girls who want Prada, women who want powder
Children are more violent, from living with less guidance
And don't learn respect til they bidding with old timers
You walk the same path now they road is wiser
A quiet man's a giant when his code is silence
Speak volume, loud dudes ain't always liver
My city never sleep, I'm a born survivor


No matter how much money we invest in our community
How many ten point plans, we propose
How many government programs we want
None of it will make a difference
Atleast not in our predicament
We also at the same time, don't cease more responsibility in our own life


I slang base and that powder too, team was the wildest crew
I seen what a dollar do
Broke nights fiend for a pot of food
Lean on the block rude, cream got 'em popping tools
And they don't stop to get it, get it
Four shots'll wet your fitted, four cops'll get acquitted
I roll dolo, I don't ask for love
Niggas be acting up, afterwords catching slugs
Every hood got heaters, many generals defeated, heavy metal pop frequent
The world crazy foul, how we suppose raise a child
Face a trial, bail over eighty thou'
In the street life, you game, player?
Haze make the pain clear, eight days the same stare
So mama say a prayer, cuz I'm out there
I'mma keep talking til they here


Providing guidance to our children
Turning off the TV sets, putting away the video games
Helping our children with their homework
Teaching our daughters to never allow images on television to tell
What they're worth
Teaching our sons to treat women with respect
That what makes them a man is not the ability to have a child but to raise one


I thought the block was all there was to life
Surfing on the drug sites, meeting up at nights
And I got tired of roaming hall, got wise to protocol
And I got mines with no regard
So all I know, is all I show
So all I see, before I go
That all I am is the truth with this land
And this roof over head, and this root to the futute fruits
Worth more than your Gucci boots
I ain't trashing fashion, I like to do me too
Still I'm guick to pop it off
With the model broad or with the Molotov
Light rocks at your tank, might make me
Take the safety off and pop it in your bank, like
You see me, I'm major
I told this story to a class of 9th graders
They saying 'Fuck school, we some fly gangstas'
I gave 'em something that can change their life later


That's a message we need to send




Come and get some, you want none
Y'all niggas wanna bring it, get done
Flashback, '88 rag type Volvo
One court solo, slash for logo
200 hyenas roam the arena
Schemin on a truck Chevy, quick to rush every
Criminal mental, satanic pen pal
Wild style on your wax for ten thou'
Most notable, Hip Hop quotable
See many went, only one got a show to do
Floor soakin wet with the drinks and dance sweat
Tell me which click got the deadliest handset
I make the mic pump, force make your feet stomp
Murderous beats move like rope for you to jump
And the two-inch, tighten with the wool-wrench
None qualifyin ass-niggas, the Jon Bentz
Spend it real, 'nuff festivals on the grill
Got a deal, no return with the Brook Shield


Breaker, Breaker 1-9, can't rhyme
Y'all niggas wanna shine, get offline


Yo, I use and abuse all groups and crews
I can't lose, straight up and down, I'm bad news
Like the bears, we folks from under the stairs
Pack a hand trigga, scared niggas don't dare
From the rear, I smash through like a John Deer
Plant a bomb in ya ear then disappear
With a speed that'll reach mach five
Niggas pop jive, that's why they on the opposite side
Dick riders tryin to make their way inside
Boy analyze, my camp be amplified
Certified live, right before your third-eye
Supply the mental high for the fiendish
Thru the intervenus, see it like a wide-screen Zenith
Got sweetness, wanna show me your cleavage
Leave it to the specialist, leave your wig split
Leavin no witness, it's a mean business
We mean business, invest in cream
Till my exit scene, I stay plottin on my next scheme


Next scheme
Blessed with the art to pierce and shoot dart
I toke the bass, put your shovel to the Rebel
Allah Just, embrace his face with the metal
Danger, woman adore to the chamber
Let this nigga run out wild with the banger
Hip Hop socialize, enterprise, snubs in the club
Twenty wizards, about 300 niggas inching your square
Or could it be the armory?
Fifty-two low hand, touch the ground
Strike his knee, pass the heat to my man
Windmill backhand bust your nose gland
Mic stand, might crash a wild fan
The Aqua, city of Atlantis, mantis, flying locusts
Surround the oppose, a bomb only has one time to explode
I blow and break and quake your whole state
Throw the shit on DAT, and make me a fuckin tape






"Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu-Tang sword style. If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous. Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?"
"En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style."


Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!


Ghostface catch the blast of a hype verse
My Glock burst, leave in a hearse, I did worse
I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk
Your head rush, fly like Egyptian musk
Aww shit, Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks, and
However I master the trick just like Nixon
Causin' terror, quick damage your whole era
Hardrocks is locked the fuck up or found shot
P.L.O. style, hazardous 'cause I wreck this
Dangerous, I blow spots like Waco, Texas


I watch my back like I'm locked down
Hardcore-hittin' sound
Watch me act bugged and tear it down
Illiterate-type asshole, songs goin' gold
No doubt, and you watch a corny nigga fold
Yeah, they fake and all that, carryin' gats
But yo, my Clan rollin' like forty macks
Now you act convinced, I guess it makes sense
Wu-Tang, yo, soooo represent!
I wait for one to act up, now I got him backed up
Gun to his neck now, react what?
And that's one in the chamber
Wu-Tang banger, 36 styles of danger


Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!

I rip it hardcore, like porno-flick bitches
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's bangin'
Wu-Tang slang'll leave your headpiece hangin'
Bust this, I'm kickin' like Seagal: out for justice
The roughness, yes, the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder one, my style shock your knot like a stun-gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty-ass nigga, with my nigga the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pulled like a trigger
So bad, stabbin' up the pad with the vocab, crab
I scream on your ass like your dadbring it on!


Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!


Yo, I'm more rugged than slaveman boots
New recruits, I'm fuckin' up MC troops
I break loose, and trample shit, while I stomp
A mudhole in that ass 'cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creepin' up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin' through your back *swish*
Givin' bystanders heart-attacks
Niggas try to fliptell me, who is him?
I blow up his fuckin' prism
Make it a vicious act of terrorism
You wanna bring it, so fuck it
Come on and bring the ruckus!
And I provoke niggas to kick buckets
I'm wettin' cream, I ain't wettin' fame
Who sellin' cain? I'm givin' out a deadly game
It's not the Russian, it's the Wu-Tang crushin' roulette
Slip up and get fucked like Suzette
Bring da fuckin' ruckus!


Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!


"En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style."
So, bring it on! So, bring it on!

Punk nigga!

Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus


Something new from my real live raps and so catch this
While I kick a verse like chapters
I'm all of that, proceed with the militant act
With the rugged Timberlands or with boots that's black
But on the real, I'm cold like blue steel
Out to catch a hit and make a mill, chill
Maintain yourself Black, you're strapping all of that
But you ain't got shit in this shack Jack
That's my word, I'm used to beef and I can eat it mad raw
And pick it out my gold teeth
But yo back to the subject, Wu's trying to get wrecked yo
Pass the weed thru your shit god mic check, need a little meth yo
True, back to me flipping you and your so called zoo
You got nothing on a nigga from Staten
A drunk monk, smoking mad skunk and stacking
I didn't need rap shit to get me on, I was a crimey
Driving a Benz hearing my man's song
And when shit gone broke out, everybody got smoked out
And cops drove the wrong route
Don't act evil and possess to hurt me, forty guns be flowing in your face
Who wants some




I rip it hardcore, like porno-flick bitches
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's banging
Wu-Tang slang'll leave the microphone hanging
Bust this, I'm kicking like Segall, Out for Justice
The roughness, yes the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder one, my style shot your knot like a stun-gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigger
So bad, stabbing up the pad with the vocab, crab
I scream on your ass like your dad, bring it on




Yo, I'm more rugged than slaveman boots
New recruits, I'm fucking up MC troops
I break loops, and trample shit, while I stomp
A mudhole in that ass, cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creeping up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fucking dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Chopping through your back
Giving bystanders heart-attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me who is him
I blow up his fuckin prism
Make it a vicious act of terrorism
You wanna bring it, so fuck it
Come on and bring the ruckus

Wu-Tang Clan (bring da mothafuckin ruckus)




Yup, you got the juice now, man


Niggas respect mine (brothers respect mine, brothers respect mien)
Respect mine (brothers respect mine)


Yo, I be, out here, in these streets
While you be, in the bed, under the sheets
I grind hard, regardless, I'm gon' eat
I don't care how many niggas you roll with or how deep
Cuz I say one word, now you fast asleep
I rebute rappers, that spread poison
I come in the meet for him, speak words that make born
You in my brainstorm, I sting men that do the innocent wrong
Your sentiments, you imagining vain things
Neglecting me, but I reign king, savagy and wankstas
Is not a part of my main stream, they plain jeans
I'm King Original, Tao Wu Tazine
Solomon darts, vocabulary Nazarines
Come with a sharp sword, I'm justified by all means, back up from my altar
Falsehood niggas become falser
I came back, and stepped out of the sourcer
Respect mines, make me an offer
Or face the 36 Chambers of Torture

"Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, brothers respect mine" - Raekwon sample scratched up


The General, Rebel the great, I'm on money like the president face
Next felony's a federal case
New blood, you can never relate
True blood, you can never debate, not in nueve tres
I spit like a deagle with the speed low
Hustle hard, gamble on the game like Pete Rose
Respect mine, steppin' with the G code
Make a nigga move like cops through the peephole
Manifesto, light it like a techno club
Outside and don't expect no love
Rolling like a west coast thug til the wheels fall off
And I be damned if you step on cuz
Brohters respect vets, son is a vet
Henny rap, feel it up on your chest
Green eyes try and smuggle my rep, so upset but you love it to death
Get it in, shits, nothing to Deck, he set

"Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, brothers respect mine" - Raekwon sample scratched up


For respect, I empty shots out of this tech
Catch homey at the light, drag him out of his Lex'
On the edge like Q on the ledge, you got the Juice now
I took a pledge to the streets, since it was goosed down
Police move foul, I can move the crowd
Freestyle or bang bang, any rapper shoot him down
Pull the ruger out, from the Hill to the Harbor
Bloomingdale Road, Goonberg, stupid clout
Old school money, get it from my grandad
So I use a nigga face like I punch a sandbag
Ran fats when the van passed
My pants sag, scuffs on my Air Max, blood on my man's rag
Got the homey loc'ing, I'm still Wolfpacking
Looking like Kobe open, just passing
Two 4, numbers I rep
So my hunger for this bread probably hustle to death, yeah

"Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, brothers respect mine" - Raekwon sample scratched up




Wuuuuuuuu! Yo


We keep (bump & grindin') we keep
We keep (bump & grindin') yeah
In the 'Jects stay (bump & grindin')
Up top they (bump & grindin')
Downtown they (bump & grindin')
In the Hill, we (bump & grindin')
That's right (bump & grindin')
That's right, yo (bump & grindin')


In the middle of the floor, they actin' hardcore
With shirts off, flirtin', of course, the Dom pour
Segal split, diggin' that hit from way back
I gained that lady with the black Baby Phat
Stacked in the back, that ass, crazy fat
She bump and grindin', makin' it clap
Baby, stop playin', why you shake it like that?
When you know how my dogs like to chase the cat
Hot lights, camera, action, packed in
Back to the front, eight cats on the blunt
The tracks gotta pump, the rats wanna thump
We strapped from the junk, got gats in the trunk
My niggas run the V.I.P., B.Y.T
Slip pass security to be by me
And I might be slidin' that too, providin' I do
Invite your crew, and I'll invite mine too


We'll be (bump & grindin')
In the back they (bump & grindin')
Up top they (bump & grindin')
Right here we (bump & grindin')
At home (bump & grindin')
Out of town we (bump & grindin')
Haters, they see us (bump & grindin')
Uh huh, uh huh (bump & grindin')


We at the bar like what?
Sweatin' out the Henny, no doubt, we fucked up
But not enough, to let you call my bluff
You feel what I feel, then raise your cup
You holdin' that hydro, blaze it up
I'm high with my eyes on snakes in the cut
Cuz some be playin' the wall, hatin' it all
Prayin' I take the fall, but they small
This, it can't stop like Shaq with the rock
I can stand in the lot and still smash the spot
Got the grass in my sock with the hash and block
Might blast your top, don't crash your drop
Keep movin', shakin', don't stop
What you doin', stay with it, won't stop
Til you blue in the face with it, can't stop
Til, it's a new day, dig it? Off top


We be (bump & grindin')
Shaolin we (bump & grindin')
All the time (bump & grindin')
Shorty, she stay (bump & grindin')
In the 'Jects (bump & grindin')
Tear up the club (bump & grindin')
Gettin' money (bump & grindin', bump & grindin')


Damn girl, I love the way that fits
Hug your waist and hips, how you sway that switch
D.J., keep playin' that hit
Watch her shake that shit, I can't take that shit
Find you in the back burnin', fat sermon on the wax turnin'
Earnin' cash, puttin' work in
Certain, to pop it off son, keep it urban
Floatin' with some perfect Timbs, powdered in suburban
Catch me in the midst, Ninja with the fifth in the gripper
Mr. Big Picture, city slicker
Who makes loot, sway suits and flavor boots
Stay loose off the Henny, the Remy or Gray Goose
Make moves like a wrestler, spark your hate groove
Make truce with berettas and birds and eight coups
Toxi' off the fine bubbly, dubs shine on the buggy
Got your eyes blurry, dimes love me


Cuz we (bump & grindin')
New York (bump & grindin')
The Dirty Dirty (bump & grindin')
Mid West Be (bump & grindin')
West Coast (bump & grindin')
Overseas they (bump & grindin')
In the Benz they (bump & grindin')
Everybody (bump & grindin')


That's right, Phantom of the Beat, ya'll
We make hits for the streets, ya'll
Rebel I., get familiar






Pretty Tone, I got you, fingers
Morphine flow, lean on the brass gold
I can see your snake eyes without the crap roll
Bust the mack stroll, laughing at you assholes
Sticking thorns in my pride like the Black Crowes
Cracking your dome for breakfast, Deck spit
Lava, fresh like the produce section
Repping, there's no use testing, you know who stepped in
It's Deck bitch, for those who question
Like Serena on the serve, I swing hard
Main event, bad broads with ring card
This shit here, niggas get the fiend nod
On the wreck, though, these cowards never seen yard
Head boss, you scavenge off what Deck toss
I don't fall for petty talk I check the source
Flex force with army arms, I lets off
Bomb threat, blow both your stanky legs off


And make you bust shots in the air and scream yeah
Or, try and learned it from the mental shit, son
And make you bust shots in the air and scream yeah
Blaow, bang, cuz
Cuz I write, and blast and slash your whole level
Or, try and learned it from the mental shit, son
And make you bust shots in the air and scream yeah
Yeah, kid


Pay attention, gun shots, fuck what you benching
Big chains on my neck, my wrist is Clinton
Presidential Rolex, coming out the projects
Seat back looking mean in a foreign object
Three for twenty in Japan, with American money
Get back home, get head from American bunnies
My Iron Fists, my platinum wrists
My cook up game is chemists, fuck my nemesis
Fly birds like Tyson do, had to switch
From the car to the cargo on board Jet Blue
Bodies drop from the Liquid Swords, been making hits for years
But I'm mad I ain't got no awards
I'm a real OG tho', swag like James Bond and 'em
My white tee is my tuxedo
Belts on the track, Sheek and Ghostface
Got the hood on smash, RZA leave it like that




We be jammin', I grill on the track just like salmon
I don't play no games, baccarat or backgammon
I'm Supreme Cliente', rawer than sushi
And if your girl got my number, means I beat that pussy
Sword slayer, dick slinger, I got the stroll
Of an R&B singer, Wu-Tang ruckus bringer
36 different dialects, we call spot checks
My homeland security, is up in the projects
Shaolin, Stapleton, Bricks on Broad Street
That's where niggas get chopped up like raw meat
Fuck that, started off rocking a stocking
Over my face, now my face is what gets it popping
Donnie had the wave voice, beeing blowed through the mic
The definition of TRU TV, fuck SPIKE
I'm the realest Akeed that ever wet these blocks
Too black for BET, too wild for Cops




Wait, hold up, chill, what's that, son?
Damn nigga got fucked, shit, huh?!
By his back, watch nigga run
Seven the center of your eight point Sun
Hold tight grip on the God-U Now, you best be careful!
Can't dodge two Self-Hes aimed at your domepiece
Father-U-C-King police!!


Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum
Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum


Yo, Rae it's been a long time son since we bust gun
Clap glaciers, ran the world and snatched paper
Return to the 36th Chamber
Proceed with caution as you enter
We have an A.P.B. on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a master


Yo something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang thang
Something in the street went BANG BANG..


Up in the boss game wilding, money for grabs
I ain't fucking with crabs, out of state copped two labs
Hopped two cabs, back on the Ave
Stab you with the vocab, catch me at the big dough rehab
Tryna re-up, keep my feet up
Snake niggas in the cut, hold the product
Time is up, no luck, heat start to bust
Niggas you can't trust, dealing with lust
Seen him at the ballgames with James


Something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang thang
Something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang


Something in the hall went 
The boxcutter went 
Something in the hole went 
The boxcutter went 


These are the bones, bones from the grave of Houdini
G-Deini, Ronzoni noodles sprinkled on your embry'
Climb like the deficit, profits, death threats
To Israel slid through Bethlehem bong on one wheel
Syringes, rubber bands, needles, the 60's
Granddaddy Caddy was copping 6 G's
B'gosh all that Oshkosh jumpers
Pink Champelle, brown paper bags, wall to wall bumpers


These ain't the camera guys, cause, turn your eyes
Sweat on the hammer fly, Ways of the Samurai
Newsflash bulletin, Gods on the prowl
We full again, ruff men scuff Timbs
Sonic bionic lens, RZA console
Is it Bush or the Dole, front row of the Superbowl
Black gold in my soul, on a ho stroll
Don't go boy you on parole you don't know?


Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK


Made 'em throw they hands up but then lay flat
Rat pack eat up, the average alley cat
Prepare for the impact when we contact
Known to drop facts that crack your hard hat
Must I show and prove, trust I, bust I
Make your head spin like chrome 20's on the buggy-I Benz
Who contends, Wu like the Superfriends
Who's your rhyming hero? Wu-Tang rules again


Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK


Yo something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang thang
Something in the street went, BANG BANG..


Something in the hole went 
The boxcutter went 
Something in the hole went 
The boxcutter went 


Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum
Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum




"This bomb was codenamed: The Czar"
"You're such an idiot. You'll never be able to contend with this opponent, why don't you lure them into the underwater graveyard?"
"Don't you think this is all kind of strange?"
"Hmm... so you know what I told him?"


Eyo, yo yo
Vein popper flame hotter
Raging sharp art patray popper
Blade sharper, kamikaze brain bomber
Safe in the drama darts spray your armor
You a trey eight revolver next to a 'nade launcher
Immortal technique, the rest weak
Stretch 'em like Lesnar
Deadly venom whenever Deck speak
Fresh meat, we get 'em buzzin' like XB
You can't sleep, it's like lying on wet sheets
Nevertheless better in fact bust better than sex
My rhyme book's like a medicine chest
Son, I kill 'em like lead to the chest
Call 7 & Es (Yo let me at 'em Deck)
Whatever is next
INS spit warhead bars, go ahead draw
I bang your dome leave your forehead gone
Run and tell 'em "put more heads on"
Performing live in your dining room
Shining through 4-X large


Lyrics get hard quick cement
Lyrics get hard
Lyrics get hard quick cement
Lyrics get hard quick cement to the ground


Stripes on me like a tiger
Whites on me actin' hyper
Cypher then I leave with bites on me from a viper
I'm the type to sell vintage 'Lo with the cookie
Buy it now, new with tags like a graf rookie
This is how you rap pussies, Timberlands and black hoodies
Make you wanna slap Snooki
Hedge your bets contact your bookie
I'll contact my wookie
True blood pumping through these veins no Sookie
I'm a soul searcher go berzerker
No nurturing took place, I cover bitch's face
With a 'Lo burqa if you're less than an 8
Like off-duty coal workers I'm out of my mine
Gun powder in lines
Flow like Red Wings Gordie Howe in his prime
Ya'll try to be thugs
I put science in my bars like Ivy League pubs
(Chewbacca noise) Chewy sound "Ya'll don't wanna fool around"
House party shit, bag a 40 like it's Cougar Town




"Come on man I feel like cuttin' loose"


Blue flames, 400 dollar jeans
The ride flee like a time machine
My regime pop beams back around Constantine's
Under marquees break apart Ki's
Park V's, spark up leaves
Artists, you see my name upon the Marquee
You charge a fee, crackheads watchin' G
Dom P spill out on the God car seat
Add a marks for heat with marksman expertise
Keep a tech to protect your fees
Collect tee's to to breath C's
Let the beef rest in peace
You connect at the lease and get greased
Hold that, your neck roll back
Both stacks overlap we locking every patch on the road map
The gold axe like Bobby Womack's to hold max
Go out back and get your shit blown back




"Man I haven't had this much fun since I was in reform school"




I want them to fight!
Sister... sister, get out of there!
If you kill them, we'll never know who's the best


What are the true keys to being a ninja?
Dressed in all black, perfect vision, and that movement is in silence, ah
What are the true keys to being a ninja?
Dressed in all black, perfect vision, and that movement is in silence
This is Shaolin (Shaolin) this is Shaolin (Shaolin)
This is Shaolin, Shaolin, Shaolin
This is Shaolin, this is Shaolin
This is Shaolin, Shaolin, Shaolin


He threw a kick at me, I back-slapped him, I pulled out the mac
He kicked it out of my hand, how real that?
Yo, a place where niggas get it on at
I think it evolved around three hundred raps, thirty stacks
He had black on, yup, I was dusted, with all of my bangles on
Two rings clustered, shorty black
He was there, this my nigga, check the bullshit, he jabbed China Man
He threw a sword right through his wool shit
Now he throwing stars at the kid, I'm jumping over my car, yo
Trying to get to my glove box and shit
Got the door open, gash in my caesar, my sneakers got red on it
Know that's blood, he threw a piece of a chain with a long blade on it
And a nigga was buckwild, I'm ducking and dodging
Trying to stick 'em with my little blade, Rae in some trouble
I got to the glove box, I threw two shots, he disappeared




I stay there like it ain't nothing to face fear
Flowers by the grave of the niggas who say where
I'm straight tear, tell them don't play fair
Then retalliation, I'm a shake 'em just for scraping my suede pair
He told me "Yo, wait right here, son, I been there"
Rip your pockets off plus nut in your dame hair
Broad day, even with jake there, serious
Last time you saw me I was rocking the same stare
Do or die, you or I, cousin, I pray for you
Forgive me for my sins, father, this is what they made me do
Nonsense cause me to slay the fool, rather than play the fool
I resort to waving the gauge at you




The year of the bullshit, why me? The nigga had Asics on
A three hundred dollar pair, B
You don't scare me, wiping blood, hear me?
He laugh with a sinister grin, the sun went down, this is grim
Now I'm sweating, still repping my square, you probably under a chair
Black hood on and sporting a gray beard


Respect mine, or there go your head line
A nigga got caught up, and left naked sporting a necktie
Skip town slide to west side, CSI riding on my hides
So I'm out til next time




(Everybody on the grind, son) 8 million stories in the naked city
(Everybody trying to eat) (It's always gonna be a struggle, in this hustle)
This is just one (Trying to bubble, trying to live this) Realize..


We dance with the wolves, wrestle with the pitbulls
For fistfuls of dollars and cents, we empty pistols
Plotting out elaborate scams to get our hands on some
Lofts of land or maybe, thoughts of plans and they be
Forcing my hand to make me, off this man
I never claimed killer, I came iller stayed realer
Our chance grows, traveled the globe, fans applauded
But my heart still roaming the streets, they still calling
Boat names with cocaine dreams screaming "I own the game!"
I'm so stained Novacaine doesn't slow the pain
Lost so many I don't fear death, no tears left
Numbers of my years left, blessed to be here left
When they said "At fifteen he'll be already dead"
I'm here heavy head steady sipping Rmy Red
Wild fellow trying to keep my mind settled
Child of the ghetto, survived where nines echo


I'm just a city guy living fly getting high
Live it till I die getting by, whipping by
Stand solidified big times to different sides
Here's your ticket right, follow if you feel my vibe... (My vibe)


Yo, we caped up, ten in the lab, weapons to blast
One with the city, fight for sections of land



Can't sleep till the check's in my hand
It's still a hustle, bare knuckle grind knee deep inside the struggle
I don't give a fuck about much but my beloved and such
Cause nobody to trust but us
It's New York life, walk like what you talk like
Or you mi




Life will let you get away
With somethin for a while
Sooner or later, you will pay the price
When you get the bill? Heh, don't be shocked
Don't act like you don't understand
Everything you do in life causes the effects
That you experience, and when you get that bill
Be prepared to pay
When the moment of wreckoning comes
You may feel as if you unable to forgive yourself
You may be too proud, to ask for forgiveness
There may be no way you can make amends or restitutions
In the worst case scenario, you may be faced with all of these
Posibilities, at the same, time
And should that happen, remember this
Life knows what you capable of
The only reason life has taken the time
To point out your shortcomings
And nasty habits, is that life wants you to act like you know who you are
This is called Self Support, Self Care and Self Love
Until today, you may not of have realized
That you have allowed others to be involved
In a crime against you, you may have allowed them
To support you and sacrificing yourself
And believing that you are helping or serving them
Just for today, don't be a yes person
Take care of yourself, don't give what you have, for what you need
Be supportive and self loving enough
To say no, and in the words of the master, Malcolm X
Asa lama lakum, my brothers


Why must all my good brothers go
I'm asking God, that's the question I want to know
Know, know, so I'm asking him why
I think about you, while these tears is in my eyes
But I know God got a soldier in the sky
Sky, sky, shorty's gon' be alright


Coming from Jersey, got the word, La's gone
House Gang CD on, pumping La's song
I think back, we was on tour
You was rocking my chain, I was rocking yours
Made me feel kinda strange, I can't even cry
Maybe cuz I'm used to hearing my people's die
Another casualty of war, but actually
I don't understand, so I'm asking the Lord
Is it all law, treated like dogs on all fours
Pain like you caught in the beartrap and lost paws
Take a short pause, and reminisce
Pain make me wanna forget, so my memory limited
How you finish it, we just beginning it
My homey's died for this, so I'm living it
Y. Million, wish I could bring him back to
I think it's time for my Loose Linx tattoo




How do I say goodbye? When I just said hi
When I just saw you riding by
When I just said those nights was fly
Now I look at your seed, and I see you when I look in his eyes
How can I be the same?
Knowing one day it's my turn to leave the game
I try to find ways to ease the ways, keep it dripping
Sipping VSOP, cuz my team is slain
While I'm writing, tears soaking the page, I'm so in the rage
I'm so in a daze, I'm still in denile
I'm blowing my haze, I can't get no higher, I'm going insane
If you can hear me and you watching me now
Give me a sign, something I can see now
Aiyo, I'm struggling to make it out of the hood, son
Damn, they took another good one




Life crazy, amazed to have you puzzled
Head high, so I stand above my troubles
I sit and build with myself
Obama's right, change is better for your health
First it started wit the crabs in the barrel
My path straight, it used to be a little narrow
I had to make my circle tighter
No snakes allowed or crabs in my cypher
Still I'm praying for my homey's in the system
It's kind of hard, trying not to fall victim
Shine brighter than the sun, this is my solar system
Ninety degrees, flow sharper than a prism
Pain is more fuel to the fire
To get me closer to them things I desire
Trying to cool off cuz I'm moving through the fire
Life better than trees, gets me higher
I had to put a leash on my anger
Shit is crazy, rest in peace to La Banga
Another soldier gone but not forgotten
The truth will always shine, we get it popping




I had a bad dream
Don't be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams
What a time you chose to be born in


Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world


It was the night before New Year's, and all through the fucking projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a Tec
Outsiders were stuck, by enemies who put fear
And blasted on the spot before the pigs were there
You know hoods, robbers, snipers new in sight, fuck blue and white
They escape before them flash the fucking lights
Gunshots, shatter first-floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether pro-calisthenic, any style you set it
Beat niggas toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides, thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless
Links was snatched off necks, scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made em fold
And squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Construction worker, who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hanging from his farmer's
And it's bugged how some niggas catch slugs
And pockets dug from everything except check stubs
And it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggas laying on roof tops
For his cream he stashed in a shoebox
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers
You don't suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
Those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae, increase the murder rate
Similar to hit men who pull out Tecs and then
Drop those who crack like tacos from Mexican
Rapid, like recipients cashing checks again
Back to the motherfucking spot on Lexington


We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world (x2)


Yo - no time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs
And seize packages and pocket the currency
Cliques control strips full clips are sprayed
Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay
Madness strikes at twelve o'clock midnight
Stick-up kids on the ground broke the staircase light
And I stays harassed, scrambling for petty cash
Jakes on my ass young bucks is learning fast
357's and 44's
Bought inside corner stores, their fire sparks the wars
Hospital floors surrounded by the law
Homicide questioning while the Jakes guard the door
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team
Cause niggas' main concern is CREAM
Some niggas in the jet black Gallant
Shot up the Chinese restaurant, for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead but instead he missed the kid
And hit a twelve-year-old girl in the head, and then fled
Tactical narcotic task force, back off fast
Cause the crime boss is passing off cash
Extortions for portions of streets, causes beef
Having followers of Indians trying to play Chief
You witness the saga, casualties and drama
Life is a script; I'm not an actor but the author
Of a modern-day opera, where the main character
Is presidential papers, the dominant factor





 Yo butter butter
 Protect Ya Neck baby
 Respect due pa
 Peace
 Peace
 Word up Wu-Tang in the house though


I guess alot of people in ya
I guess they can feel the realness you
They could feel the vibe
And I think hip hop, that's what I be tellin a lot of people
Alot of record promoters and alot of artists
I mean it's like, it's music that you gotta touch and feel
You know what I'm sayin'
And I think that comes across well in the video
I haven't seen you live yet, I'm waitin for the chance
But I'm pretty sure that's probaly what's it like
You know you probaly really get into it

Hit a nigga later, he got to vacate 'em
Old Dirty corporata, splash, I'm up on the punanny flash
Bad gas, Macintosh, the light is red

What a waste, I'm up in yo' face like what
All you niggas I'm puttin you in your place

HOOK 


Mr. No-Meaner, pussy ho-beater

Pump 'em and defeat 'em, dump 'em, and delete 'em
This negro right here pimps hoes

Yeah, pump that shit, testin
Check, 1,2, yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes y'all, to my niggas y'all
To my click y'all, you can't quit y'all
Wu-Tang bangin' that dope shit y'all
That make you wanna roll up and smoke shit y'all
To the beat y'all, you can't sleep y'all
On my flow y'all niggas don't know y'all
You see my style calm but wild
You witness the rhyme, nothin but dimes
The eightball murder verse, freestyle or rehearsed
I wreck emcees whether I'm last or first
What, what, what, what, hazardous dart
Visual long forgotten art
That fell apart, til the blood ran from the heart
Pump through the street, Rza make re-break beats
Packed seats, rapid fire raps at off track meets
And an arm tank, high rank, heavy metal shank
Blow 'em off the plank when they ships approach the bank
Wu niggas rollin, throwin the first rap slogan
Heroes of Hogan, shot up the military clothin'
Quickly blow up, rolled up in rappers like pennies
My brother stack tracks on the behalf of many
With the wisdom, power of, science from experts
Self applyin, that put giants in the network
Through compact discs and televised live quotes
We multiply our strength, on a worldwide note
Yes, what, what


Yes, yes y'all, you don't stop
You keep on, til the break o dawn
Ah yes, yes y'all, you don't stop
Ah Wu-Tang known to make your body rock




To anyone whoever lost one
Survival it may cost one


Yo, what up kid it's been a few years
So many blood, sweat and tears shed
Ya name still appears in my head
It seems like yesterday we floated to Queens
Holdin' cream, only 16, 'bout to load up the triple beam
Paper chasin', gettin' thrown in the pens over and over again
Comin' home sittin' low in ya bed
If ya stairin' down on me right now show me the path
So I know that havin' my people can close the gaps
Me, daily I spar as I tour this world bizarre
I've been hit pretty hard, suprised I made it this far
Seen your daughter yesterday, she's such a beaurtiful girl
Besides today, ain't nothin' really new in my world
So I wish you was here, we had a vision and the picture was clear
We'd both get rich off this and disappear
Your life is over but your legacy's just begun
And that is said, only the good die young
I guess it's all good


Cradle to the Grave (from the Cradle to the Grave)
Don't throw your life away
Such a price to pay
I still feel the pain
I remember when
Things were so different then
But I'll remain ya friend
'Til we meet again


Is Heaven any different from Hell? Is it worth the battle?
In search of Heaven I can get trapped too
Sometimes I wanna join you, take my place upstairs
But I'm not ready to leave my family in despair
I know if you was here you'd be rockin' the latest Nike Airs
All the fires gear burnin' one, totin' hardwear
Or we hit Lennox, check precise set of Lexus
Check the message on the pager; "it's two bucks the next chicks"
I had to do this, for Earnie Sayon and Aaron Lewis
And all my families that have been through this
And I know my days are numbered too because of you
Aiyo you got it locked, hold me a spot for when I come through
'Til then I gotta be strong, a time bomb
One step from doin' life, my rap sees miles long
But like simply when I keep holdin' on
But I can only hold on for so long




It's a Cold World kid, you ain't really missed much
It's hard just to get up, it's hard not to give up
I struggled tryna move up, I might lose touch
Been fightin' all my life for my right to do such
To all my single mothers strugglin'
Life bitters to the thugs out hustlin', here me
To all who walked the long road and met the end of the route
I miss you all so I send this out








I know it's crazy
I know it's crazy, but you can't quite turn away


It's foul in the street, criminal in the street
Little child running wild, struck down in the street
I'm strapped for the brawl, story of the hood
It was written, you can read it in the graph on the walls
Long as cash is involved, they blast for the cause
And you better break bread or you asking for war
Trying to come out the hood, pray for him
Cuz he would put the gun down if he somehow could
Baby being born, teenage mother
Fly baby boy found laying in the dumpster?
She couldn't bare the load, she begged for forgiveness
Because it's just tears of soul
And the world so cold, world so bold
Gotta make it so my boy and baby girl grow old
Hold my head cuz I could be the nigga in the news
Stressed cuz I need these figures for this food




I want a better life for my children, I'm building
I'm voting for Barack, I just hope they don't kill him
I'm bugging off the government, they bugging off the fact
That the next pres, gonna be a woman or a black
I"m sure what's in store, ain't cater to the poor
And I bet many more won't make it through the storm
But I take it will be strong, we face harder hard ships
Labeled me, low class, treat it like I'm garbage
Still I stand tall, rising like a phoenix from the ash
My life trynna see it if I can
Cuz to me it's all I have, no I wouldn't trade it
I just meet you on the other side, homey, if I make it
That's why I'm bigger on the grind
I'm so close to the edge, cuz I live on the line, and
Mankind's heading for the worse
We gonna end the world if God don't get to us first




My man just lost his job
And he was down three, so, now he forced to rob
He was good til he caught the charge
Trying to live that American dream, a three car garage
Man, it's hard and it's ways to go
You can't run from it, cuz there's no place to go
And there's no face you know
And there's no cake to blow, and there's no space to grow








What that nigga want, God?
Word up, look out for the cops though
Wu-Tang five finger shit
Cash rules-
Word up, two for fives over here, baby
Word up, two for fives, niggas got garbage down the way, word up, know what I'm sayin'?
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. get-
Yeah, check this old fly shit out, word up
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M.
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all
Take you on a natural joint
Here we here we go, check this shit, yo


I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I be gettin' the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this, son
Rollin' with this one and that one
Pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smokin' woolas at 16
And runnin' up in gates, and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
Catchin' keys from 'cross seas
Rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo, nigga, respect mine, or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-POW! Move from the gate now!


Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all


It's been twenty-two long hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask: what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
And ain't tryin' to hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic


Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all


Niggas got to do what they got to do
To get through, know what I'm sayin'?
Because you can't just get by no more
Word up, you gotta get over, straight up and down


Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all




(CREAM!) What I came for (CREAM!) What I bang for
(CREAM!) Same thing that I claim House Gang for
(CREAM!) What I ride for (CREAM!) What I die for
(CREAM!) Same thing that I'll catch a homicide for


D.C.'s a veteran man
You could tell from the way I'm makin' saless, I'm the medicine man
Double ups, 12 12's or I'm sellin' them grams
That stuffed up like shells, till I'm building a cantalin
Everyday I move an ounce, and it's nothin' for D.C
To open up your face like a new account
Pack 'em up and move 'em out, that's how the game go
They strappin' up and shootin' out, for blocks like our names on 'em
Glocks with them thangs on it, make it easy to spray you
And lay you in a box with your name on it
Cops could obtain warrants, but they ain't hurtin' the kid
By searchin' the crib, my pops had the same honor




House Gang A.W.O.L., don't play at all
Have you on a rest in peace mural, frame and all
Many, combinations and safes, lost
Denomination's a cake, you found the right one
Bet it's this way, ain't nothin' stoppin' us, the music we make
Reality based, Animette, baggin' the base
Baby powder stuff a pussy, make her travel the state
Fuck up my cake, make her throw the mac in your face
And that'll probably be a wrap to the case
So don't move, and don't try to even get the cops involved
So many shots, make you wonder how a Glock revolve
Black car hard, ski-masks and gloves for jobs
And for CREAM sweep the streets, and it's death for ya'll
Yeah, House Gang, haha




Yo, it's cash and murder, coincide like masks and burners
If it ain't about CREAM, it don't concern us, nigga
Learn from old heads, the whole bread follow a certain rule
Standin' on the corner, cherpin' urban blues
Swim with it, dodgin' D's, rockin' workin' shoes
You know the rules, you don't know 'em, then don't serve them dudes
Work the graveyard, I play hard you, punk mothafuckas
Gat tucked, with the cracks in our Chuckers
Fiends got Nextels, so pigs can't touch us
Dope fiends love us, it's the hood mothafuckas
Ice Water Inc., and the House Gang collabo
Bang at you assholes, your lungs out the lasso's?, faggot




Most of ya'll be talkin' a lot, how you war with the Glock
You oughta stop, can't walk on your block
Undadogz ball hoggin' the rock, while you be talkin' to cops
Be gettin' our gross pay, off the top
In my House Gang 'bout thang, we count change, pound lanes
Think you hotter, I'll abdoust your flame
If it's aimed at your doggy, I'll shout your name
You could bring it, but I doubt you'll hang, bang, bang
The bigger the funds, the bigger the guns, it's poppin'
Where niggas is from, the sicker the slums, it's got in
And under your nose, the youngest of fows is plottin'
We bubblin' O's, the government knows, they watchin'
The gladiator, call me General Max, I'm on dough, like a federal tax
Hundred grand for the beacon, U.D.'s had the festival packed
Touch mine in the metal'll clap, don't ever relax
Move through a several caps, nice frames
Iced out chains, House Gang tapped on the back
Tight game, fly dames, son's baggin' up cracks
Why change when we have it like that, huh?
Why change when we have it like that?




El dinero manda sobre todo a mi alrededor, Cream consigue el dinero
Billetes de dlar para todos



Crec en el lado del crimen, el lado del New York Times
Sobrevivir no era un broma
Tena segundas manos, Mama rechaz al hombre viejo
As que nos mudamos a la tierra Shaolin
Una joven jueventud, meneando el diente de oro, Polo, Goose
La nica manera de conseguir "G off" era la droga
Y vamos a empezar as hijo, yendo con este y con ese
Apretando gatillos por diversion
Pero solo era un sueo de un adolescente que era un diablo
Empec a fumar "woolas" a los 16
Enfrentndome a puertas, y dando golpes por altas inversiones
Haciendo mi camino por salidas de incendios
Sin duda "speedara" por crack y hierba
La combinacin me hizo sangrar los ojos
Sin duda proveera e intentara conseguir toda la pasta
Atracando a chavales blancos en canchas de baloncesto
Mi vida no iba a mejor, el mismo maldito polo
Los tiempos son speros y duros como el cuero
Comprend que haba ido por la ruta incorrecta
As que me hice con locura de panda y sal
Pillando kilos atravs de mares
Dando vueltas en MPV's cada semana ganbamos 40 G's
Hey nigga, respeta lo mo o aqu va el TEC-9
Ch-Chick-POW, muvete por la puerta ahora

 x2



Han sido veintids largos duros aos de seguir en apuros
La supervivencia me tena nervioso, pero estoy vivo a la llegada
Echo un vistazo a la forma de las calles
Y me mantengo despierto para los caminos del mundo porque la mierda es profunda
Un hombre con un sueo, con planes de hacer "cream"
Que fall; fui a la crcel a los 15 aos
Un joven chaval vendiendo drogas y tal, que nunca tuvo mucho
Intentando coger un pedazo de lo que no poda (tocar)
El tribunal me la jug corto, ahora me las veo con el encarcelamiento
Paseando, yendo arriba es mi destino
Esposado en la parte de atrs de un bus, cuarenta de nosotros
La vida de un cro no debera ser tan dura
Pero mientras el mundo giraba aprend que la vida es un infierno
Viviendo en el mundo no diferente a una celda
Cada da escapo de "Jakes" persiguiendo, vendiendo base
Fumando "bones" en la escalera
Aunque no s por qu elijo fumar hierba
Supongo que es el momento en el que no estoy deprimido
Pero sigo deprimido y pregunto para qu vale?
Preparado para rendirme y ver la vieja tierra
Quien explic que trabajar duro puede ayudarte a mantenerte
Para aprender a vencer a la pena y el dolor
Tenemos nios atracadores, policas corruptos, y rocas de crack y
Balas perdidas, todo en el bloque que se mantiene caliente
Djamelo a mi mientras soy prueba viviente
Para ensear la verdad a la joven negra juventud
Pero los cros corriendo salvajes, fumando hierba, bebiendo cerveza
Y sin intentar or lo que les pongo en sus odos
Ignorado por ahora, pero yo, tiene que ser aceptado
El qu? Que la vida es agitada






To all those C.R.E.E.P.S. out there
Crime Regulators Eating Everday Pulling Stings
C.R.E.E.P.S...., they be out there lurking
Watching... real low key, though
Watching niggas get that dough
Just waiting, patient... gon' make your move soon
I said "Make it, don't fake it" knawImean?
Better watch yourself.. yo...


If you making money off, you better hold your heat
(Don't go to sleep, there go them C.R.E.E.P.S)
If you icey with the jewelry and the gold teeth
(Don't go to sleep, there go them C.R.E.E.P.S)
If you wheeling through the hood, and you overheat
(Don't go to sleep, there go them C.R.E.E.P.S)
In the streets, they king
And mean Crime Regulators Eating Everyday Pulling Stings


Get low sneaks, throws in the street
Still grinding, same clothes on the whole week
Play low key, lurking through these cold streets
Stay smoking, ain't never got no weed
At the dice game, watching the bank
If it's money, then they plotting to shank, like Saw
You saw it coming, but couldn't stop it with tanks
Caught your pockets, the watch and the link, no lifers
Thrown through the fire, ain't scared of jail
Might run through your stash while you making a sale
Creeping in the gray BM, then hit you and your lady friend
For all your savings at the ATM
See them C.R.E.E.P.S. got nothing to lose
They take they ass kicking, get snuffed & bruised
Get shot, seen and certainly do 'em
Unplug the IV, and bounce out the emergency room
Still hurt from the wound, to him it's a thrill
He bout to, do it again like Sidney and Bill
He bout to, hit up the crib, for some ecstacy pills
Shot the fiend, cuz he ran to the jiggy and squealed
You can find him where the drugs be at, where it's lovely at
With the window cracked, scoping with the rusty gat
Or at the check cash', focus at your money stack
Or at the bar, where them ballers pop they bubbly at






(One two, one two)
No doubt
(The microphone's on)
Cross my heart, hope to die, word is bond
(I've been waiting along time for this)
Here we go, Killah Priest, '97, '98


It's the Byzantine king, supreme
All kneel kiss the ring into a Elohim
I blow steam from the families of the Maccabees
Smack emcees, watch 'em scream, "Your Majesty!"
Make them suffer the capacity of tragedy
Hold the crowd down like gravity
Back the fuck off, stop grabbing me, hands off me
Niggas start to bore me, I'm getting sleepy, I need some coffee
Me and my Wu-bandits
We bury niggas deep in the canvas, body bandage
Like some mummies, you fucking dummies
You can't take nothing from me
It's the longest waited
The most anticipated, the album hesitated
Scream the name out, "Killah Priest!"
I leave the blood spilling in the streets
I'm from the dark hills of Brownsville
The seven shields on windmills across the killing fields
Never forget it, tell them rap critics
I speak in arithmetics
So they can never get it, I'm too scientific
Lyrics explicit, I roll with thirsty niggas, thieves and killers tigers, gorillas, faces like Godzilla
We stomp rappers and smile like a card dealer
We got iller, cross my heart and hope to die
We multiply, by the hundreds
Drunken by the thousand, see me outside your show browsing
Beating up your soundmen
Player haters and players, we give 'em cold stares
Any last prayers?


Concrete techniques, bomb beats that cause casualties
My faculty, hold it down like gravity
Rapidly threaten like weapons to adolescents
Ghetto residents quick to past tense your present
State of the slums, kill for a plate of crumbs
Fake ones, they're coarse with smiles with snake tongues
I'm deep into this,I sometimes gasp for air
Deadly warfare, hot blocks, cops, and cold stares
Shots blare like fireworks on July the 4th
Weapons get tossed, fugitive sliding off
My forces combine, new world, 2009
Digital criminals, we make mills in cybercrime
It's all planned ahead 2 times, I see the signs through a great mind
The heaviest chains could not bind


We stare you eye to eye
We tell the truth no lie
We cross our heart and hope to die.. hope to die..


High ranked officials in armed tanks with missiles
Blood drizzle, simple fact, you slept on the issue
That before you started jerkin off Joysticks and Sega
I was rocking off 100 watt amps in Cerwin-Vega
True fine tune it, ship enough units
MCs ask, "Who be those rhyme killers in masks?"
No doubt, difficult task to last in the square
Beware, infinite amount of darts is in the air
I'm victorious with no opponents and blast through components
With microphonics, watch the whole world live the moment
Anything anti became approaching this
Our incapable love speech remains motionless



Hope to die..




It is what it is my nigga, yeah
More motherfucking verbal madness
More motherfucking beat downs
More smashing your motherfucking head into the fucking wall
Oh No, lets get it


Everytime I spit its like a hammer spray
Each word is a bullet in the hand of ain't
Infinite ammunition in the chamber gauge
I layin down anybody within the range
Sitting passenger seat up in my niggas Range
Windows down and smelling like the illest strain
Cant outsmoke the O its like a loaded train
I derail your tracks then yell my name (Oh No!)
Homie Im a menace to the music
O-Dog when he shootin, cant nobody do shit
But Id rather get my brain boosted
While Im getting brain from this pretty young thang movin
Now that right there, I call it head stock
Rising in the charts with Czarface, get your head start
With the old hood hoarder, Im Redd Foxx
Pushing big stones out the quarry like Bedrock


(Still here?) Czarface
(Still here?) Czarface
(Still here?) Czarface
(Still here?) Czarface


Ay yo I pen heat, Hardaway, surgical gloves, blood on my Prada frames
Smoother than Sade operates, spit until the nozzle ache
Currency tall, what your dollar say
You only a boss at your mama place
I lay my head where the lead fly and choppers chase
Getting bread, pies and cookies on top of cakes
Wu conglomerate, honor me great
I know that ya'll relate, darling your face
Eating pasta plates, not today (?) time, my name they got the same
Monumental like Diana as Billie Holiday
Part of day, beats from the east, release for honest pay
Wired for beloving, never mind what the coppers say
Shot clock on top of my game, you can spot em with the model dame
Whole team poppin the same, rep Marvin Gaye
Shark in your way, these niggas Jon Benet
Trademark morphine flow, watch your body shake


(Still here?) Czarface
(Still here?) Czarface
(Still here?) Czarface
(Still here?) Czarface


Bodies everywhere, headstones and leg groans
Iron fist in a velvet glove, I know you felt the love
Fuck your lead tool, I'll murk you like Deadpool
Decapitate you early, so I stay ahead of schedule
We arrogant Homes, dap kings no Sharon Jones
We pharaohs in thrones, sub-saharan with the poems
I am a carnivorous beast, I'm made of metal and spikes
I made the living deceased, we some rebels on mics
Im on the building and Im sniping the hater
Im Charlie Manson in a darth helmet : Psycho invader
Eso spazzin on that stupid ass, spit til the computer crash,
Have you breathing through a mask, like Bane or maybe Tuukka Rask
I am taking you to task, kill you let the funeral pass
I guarantee the coffin fit, like the cats do to grass
I aint joking, feed your family to Logan
Its like 1000 flows Im over and get buried through the map


Czarface

He's a karate man sir, a mean bastard
And in his karate matches, he's killed seven men so far
(He must think he's Bruce Lee!)

Czarface!
You (?) running around here
I don't know what the man's problem is, if he thinks he's Optimus Prime or what, but we're gonna show you
We haven't forgotten about you for one minute
We use guys like you for experiments, for medical experiments
We're gonna shape you up, clean your act up, and get you looking right brother!
So when we shoot you back into time, and when we shoot you through the time space continuum
You'll be liked!
You'll be liked!
You'll be liked!
You'll be liked!
You'll be liked!
You'll be liked!
You'll be liked!




Ahhh! It is the Czarface!


Yo, there go the speakers, I'm naturally glowing, blowing sativa
Amazing display of art, unique as Mona Lisa
Non-believers, they bitching like R & B divas
I'm headache, chest pain, hard to breath fever
He's a resident patient, F all the expectations
Echo the sentiment if you repping the rebel nation
Let go the arsenal, the odds impossible
Speak the gospel, we harder than army obstacles
Watch your dude monster mash for a wad of cash
Ironic how niggas garbage be talking trash
Hashtag more than rap, might fuck around
And lose your cataracts if you saw it in rap
Deep in the pits, i speak swift, pleading the fifth
Only time I go soft? After pleasing your bitch
We the shit, official with the stripes and all
And for the drought? we keep a high supply of the raw


Let's make it understood, Czarface is a hero
But he's up to no good (no good)
Nod ya head to this shit, but make it effortless, quick
When it comes to rap shit we the specialists, kid


7 load the beat, the Nikes on my feet are deadstock
Until they go through your teeth
To my soldiers in the street, who are really cats in the lab
Rappers on their Ipad, trend-humping every fad
Give me something I can grab
Something with some substance
Your tracks be sounding flat, our tracks? Kate Uptons
Listen: they took a quick poll, concluded I was a sick soul
Said you gotta see Czar, no Nick Kroll
Rappers talking 'bout how they living in that studio
They're talking about their one-room apartment
To a homeless man, it's beautiful
I guess they need some room to grow
But if they get a budget it's, they talking "How that booty go?"
Sellout, sellout, muthafucka get the hell out
It's time to break that Esoteric, Deck and 7L out
Keep balling, 'cuz emceeing ain't your calling
Leave that shit to us, we rushing stages like Stalin






Yo
Ah, one-two, ah, one-two
Hold up, hold up, hold up
Yo


The flow call it Jon Snow  King of the North
I bust tai chi moves when I'm bringing it forth
Swinging my sword, think twice, blood'll be drawn
Only few animals survive the flood of the storm
When a 1-2 brother is cash
Now you can try to silence me, you can never muzzle the blast
Out in Amsterdam puffing some hash
Nothing but all foreign currency stuffed in my bags


As a youth  Sammy thinking I could blast tecs
Bigger than I'm Batfleck's last check, We know
What it takes to put you in a casket below
Sea level like your rap status, I get evil
Lines flying out my mind like a parademon in a dream sequence
Zoning out like I'm Brad Stevens' team defense
We stay on target
We building the CZAR-lab then dip in the CZAR-jet


Bring it back, br-bring it back
If you coming for war then bring it back
Bring it back, br-bring it back
If you coming for war then bring it, bring it, bring it


Deadly power lines caused a blackout
Been doing this since news flicks, Mickey with the mac out


Rappers try to back out, I smack and make him tap out
Crew deep, run with more teams than Jerry Stackhouse
These cats need to give it up


I'm like (word)
I'm tryna live it up and get bucks, I spit it tough, listen up
Stand like a high rise, high five chick mixing up Mai Tais
Ray Pizzaria how we slice pies
Beat foreign, trees orange, blue and green Ralph Lauren
Worst days still look like he important
The heart is in me
Plus the sharper darts start the frenzy
Pull out against me, I'ma spark till the cartridge empty


We the kinda brothers hit you like The Steiner Brothers
Top choice it is, you can't rhyme above us, no
Kick rocks gets your assignment from us
I see the moves you make, man, it don't remind us of us (nah)
Wasn't bits of some shit, now you ain't done shit
Listen, we hold the record like vinyl covers
I bet your diamond love us, probably wanted diamond from us
They always pick CZARFACE
We animated like a Pixar face
We notorious, so glorious
We the Legion of Doom, the Road Warriors


Rap warlord, now picture black 
The Reservoir Dog barking like a gat sawed off
Glide like Tony Hawk, bossing the sport
Penny for my thoughts
Thinking like two or three mil'll be the cost


Bring it back, br-bring it back
If you coming for war then bring it back
Bring it back, br-bring it back
If you coming for war then bring it, bring it, bring it



Daddy's Little Girl featuring Inspectah Deck of Wu Tang Clan and Iliana Eve


Daddy's Little Girl (ahh ahhh)
Repeat 4x


She sees sex as a way of leaving hell
But she won't kiss and tell
Brenda's baby was the love of her life
Then she lost it and left Christ
So she sees sex as a way of leaving hell
On her way up she tripped and fell
When Brenda lost her baby it all collapsed
Now she's on her knees but not at mass...




Daddy's little girl...
Alone in this cold world, reality'll make your toes curl
She's an angel but she's caught up in the devil's hold
So the trials and tribulations made her sell her soul
So confused, she can't close the open wounds
So consumed, nothing left but the smoking fumes
Have you seen her lately? Hot like a pizza oven
I seen her meet with this pimp, I'm thinking he was Russian
They saying she's disgusting, I'm saying cease the judgement
Cause everybody plays the fool, she just needs some loving
A shell of herself, far cry from days past
She used to be the flyest girl in Ms. Jane's class
You better change fast, before you're ordered to a state max
Or your daughter choose the same path
You're hurting, you're lonely, only you can stop the hell
That's when you realize you are not for sale

A game of chess is like a swordfight:
You must think first before you move
Toad style is immensely strong
And immune to nearly any weapon
When it's properly used it's almost invincible


Raw I'ma give it to ya, with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
Like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MC's approach with slang that's dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushin' force, my force you're doubtin'
I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains


Well, I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary and carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum, and the isle I'm from
Is comin' through with nuff niggas and nuff guns
So if you wanna come sweatin', stressin', contestin'
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk
I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain, there's no way to barricade me
Steamrollin' niggas like an 18 wheeler
With a drunk driver drivin', there's no survivin'


Rough like Timberland wear, yeah
Me and the Clan in 'Yota Landcruisers out there
Peace to all the crooks, all the niggas with bad looks
Bald heads, braids, blow this hook
We pack chrome TEC's, nickel-plated MAC's
Black AC's, drug-dealin' styles in phat stacks
I only been a good nigga for a minute though
'Cause I got to get my props and win it, yo
I got beef with commercial-ass niggas with gold teeth
Lampin' in a Lexus, eatin' beef
Straight up and down, don't even bother
I got 40 niggas up in here now who kill niggas' fathers


My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Bees on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats


Here I go, deep type flow
Jacques Cousteau could never get this low
I'm cherry bombin' shits BOOM!
Just warmin' up a little bit, vroom vroom
Rappinin' is what's happenin'
Keep the pockets stacked and then, hands clap and then
At the party when I move my body
Gotta get up and be somebody!
Grab the microphone, put strength to the bone
DUH DUH DUHenter the Wu-Tang zone
Sure enough when I rock that stuff
Huff? Puff? I'm gonna catch your bluff tuff
Rough, kickin' rhymes like Jim Kelly
Or Alex Haley, I'm a Mi-Beetle Bailey rhymes
Comin' raw style, hardcore
Niggas be comin' to the hip-hop store
Comin' to buy grocery from me
Tryin' to be a hip-hop MC
The law, in order to enter the Wu-Tang
You must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang
Represent the GZA, Abbot
RZA, Shaquan, Inspectah Deck
Dirty Ol' gettin' low with his flow
Introducin' the Ghostface Killah
No one could get iller


My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats


Speakin' of the Devil, psych!
No, it's the God, get the shit right
Mega trife, and yo, I killed you in a past life
On the mic while you was kickin' that fast shit
You reneged, tried again and got blasted
Half-mastered-ass style, mad ruff task
When I struck I had on Timbs and a black mask
Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack
That night, yo, I was hittin' like a spiked bat
And then you thought I was bugged out, and crazy
Strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy
Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs
Never shot thugs, I'm runnin' with thugs that flood mugs
So, grab your 8 plus 1
Start flippin' and trippin', niggas is jettin', I'm lickin' off, son


Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang!


Homicide's is legal and death is the penalty
One justifies the homicide when he dies in his own iniquity?
It's the master of the Mantis Rapture comin' at ya
We have an APB on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a master
Evidence indicates that his stature
Merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
The flow changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like a lie, paralyzin' the victim
You scream as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Movin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
And injure any motherfuckin' contender


My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gats





This is my dick tone
Your flows so dated that it has friends with flip phones
Now my shits grown
Im at a clam bake with Man-Ape
Youre eating Alpo with Edie Falco on the Jersey landscape
What type of a stunt is that?
What type of a G.I. Joe Grunt is that?
Part Mark Hamill, part camel, part Lexus door panel, part vandal
You have the self-esteem of 17 teen net queens
That are less lean, yet whos breasts seem
Flatter than boards used by a chess team
They chicken heads like robots from Seth green and their breaths obscene
Im an ex-marine death machine
Youre a nectarine thats never mean and never seen
With their  clean
Youre dope, like the NFL refs are clean
I get it popping while the rest snooze, cuddle up and dream
Youre the original to Ignition
Im the remix, the fix to what was missing
Listen, you dont want to stand up for Sea
On the mic Im wise like Gandalf the Grey



Your new bars lukewarm this is pizza oven
I lean a fiend eyes bulged cheeks sucked in
Crazy like the second Jesus coming
To me its nothing
You hear the music gets scary when the beats is coming
Imma bring it to your face no 3D glasses
Airing out bombs like TD passes
Splash in a mint green Aston
GT mashing
Czarface CD blasting
Verbal Intercourse colder than the Winter Warz
Hard bars lock you in like a prison door
Haters they jell, oh well I dont care about em
Hated since 12, yeah I take the air out em
That mean the oxygen
Arsonist they charging them
The Czarface dodging the case with Ray Donovan
Full time mind blower eyes on the soldier
Get the money, get the girls, strike a pose on a poster
And Im ghost son




The nigga had a pair of Air Olden Polynice's on
Oh shit, the nigga had a pair of Air Christian Slaters
Rebel I, slay the max, it's really Digital
Rockin' the latest in, every day comin' at niggas
Rockin' the latest in Ben Stillaways
Fuck that, the next big thing, lay this as Hollywood niggas
Now that's a money thing
Yo yo


I was +Dashing+ through the hood
Eighteens with the whip, smoke gray
Leavin' skid marks on five-oh
Smokin' all the way, hahaha!
With my all-star team, bitches see our shine
Yo son we gotta make that +CREAM+ whether raps or nicks and dimes


They call me Rollie, watch me poly with the wide body Dinali
Packed the bad hottie, rocked enough ice to play hockey
I swarm like paparazzi, she popped a wheelie on the candy apple Kawasaki
Everything is sloppy, philosophical for those who copy
I'll probably splash her tonight, don't block me
Sippin' on Lime Bacardi got me toxy
Plus the Cali 'dro holdin' me, I'm 'bout to 'scape like the Roxy
Ever property, Monopoly, big shotti
Snatch the +CREAM+, whether in the concert hall or in the lobby
Used to be a hobby, got me duckin' Rudy Giulianni
Like I'm still coppin' big eights from papi
Follow me, whether Mardi Gras' or house party
It's wild like safari, ain't mean to catch the body
But had 'em wobbly off the first blow, tryin' to knock me
I'm known to pump ya blood like the theme song to Rocky
Kamikaze, might karate chop ya head like a natty dread
Then call myself Collar Ratsi
Professionally trained, I aim for your artery
I give the autographs but charge for photography
Not hardly kid, you awkward Godbody
You'se a carbon copy, just started to rock Wallys
Spark the broccoli, spaz off this ghetto opery
Or catch the hot seat, you're batty bwoy without ya posse
Seen..


Come, come, come
One for the dough, son
Give me the reasons


They couldn't get me, watch me move swiftly
Broke the unmarked fifty with this cabby who was a gypsy
He stayed tipsy, said he loved his bills crispy
Drivin' the streets he kept heat on the night, shifty
Quickly, who ring bells like it's twelve on Sunday?
While the stage catch shells from forceful gunplay
Mere fact that the track was a fierce counterattack
All those who couldn't multiply were sent back
No tanks, low rank, soldiers hittin' the heart
Tainted the heart of an empire, was torn apart
Brought to a halt from a front full assault
The chemist left the lab with undetermined results
They saw the swordsman sift electrical volts
The audience threw nuts with loose screws and bolts
The archives automatically changed ya stiff vibes
It was layin' in the zip drive from chest five




Your faith in Shaolin is courageous
You blind fool we have our teachings to share
Our joy with the people
And there too suffer for them as well
You have learned your style well
Wu-Tang Style




Yeah Laurenivich (Look! Down there!)
Its that Czarface shit
Murderous wordplay
My verbs slay
Ya heard me?
Yo, yo, lets go


More rings the Mario Elie, rocking the Pelle
On Bond Street, ordering salmon only the belly
Peace to Toro, all my niggas wore 'lo
Fuckin' with raw blow, never go to war slow
Shit, Im know for rocking silk collectibles
Hardcore gutter, my style straight out of vestibules
Now we at festivals throwing the crowd vegetables
Looking fly on stage grabbing my testicles
Four color camo, full clip dont need ammo
Shooting with a broken strap like a ripped sandal
Cop whips and crash em, pop guns and blast em
Make cracks and stash em, come through and splash em
Nigga acting wild is my style, its all fashion
Non-biodegradable team, we all-lasting
Used to get home sick, now Im getting sick of home
So I breeze OT, getting some different dome


Im lights out sorta like closing time
Ill body your soul and leave you with an open mind
Skywalker with the force, call me Czar Fonz
Going and blowing from the start like car bombs
Rubber grips on the cordless, applaud this
Girls behaving badly, I call Lucy lawless
Im on it, broadcast live from Ground Zero
Culture savior, label the town hero
Yeah your boys lost from the coin toss
Know the slogan, cant beat em better join force
In the hood like shitty apartments
Hate me now on some Diddy and Nas shit
City of God shit, mobbin, fedoras and cigars lit
Face-czar, lock the block like a cal roarin'
You talk about green son, Im Hal Jordan


I got money in my jeans, killer in my blood
With shit like this yo I kill it like I peel a slug
Rappers wanna feed off my buzz, I dont need all them hugs
You my dog right? eat off them rugs
I made Gs off a thug shit even though Im a grown man
Walk around holding hand of my son shit
You cant spit that pun shit without having to punch shit
We run shit, murder with words not on some gun shit
Im low down dirty and deceitful
Landlord kick me out the crib said his residence was evil
My face dont deserve to be sketched on an easel
It belongs on a mountain next to legendary people
Im lethal, Czarface someone that the cops avoid
Been killing yall since Nick Fury was a caucazoid
Minds brilliant but its twisted like the thoughts of Freud
'Lo'd out, kiss the canvas like you box with Floyd
I body rappers automatically
And leave em deader than my iPhone battery


Got to get to someplace where I can plug in my extension cord and recharge.
An electrical outlet. Can he find one in time?




"Gods are serving bound and bound like an eagle 'round it's prey"
"Huge battle axe causing pain"


In the dead zone souls are forgotten where they forever roam
Terrordome, desolate echoes remember this is home, taking devils on
The Rebel's sure to rep it 'til they carve his name in stone
I'm trekkin' through the desert still in search of any life
I've turned in many nights
There is rumors of survivors, still no trace of them in sight
My mental as my guide
I'm trapped in total darkness
Still I could see regardless
Cause there's fire in my eyes


Like the House of a 1,000 Corpses
Your bound to get bound and tortured
Down with your crown and fortress
Zombies surround the porches
Solomon Grundy central
Who's going through the window
Our fate is still in limbo
Skull and bones that is the symbol
And no one will report this cause vultures, they ate the sources
Rifles in the hand like Al Qaeda forces, they blazing torches
Let's get it cracking, nomadic traveler always packing
Just keep an eye out cause anything could happen


"Walk straight but don't walk late"
"Just waiting to destroy"
"How delightful"
"Walk straight but don't walk late"
"As the rebels set up camp they were being watched"


Zombieland, waited to kill him, not with the shottie blast
Undead, cut off the head, burn the body fast
Pray to god we last, they'll damn another victim
We'll just wait for dawn to pass but for now play our position
Daybreak, me, 7, Es chose to stay awake
Silhouette appears through the trees, I see a stranger face
?? stay away, don't fall into a trap and now he running straight this way
No time for falling back


Yeah
Murder by metal axes, certain like death and taxes
Versatile weapons caches, no mercy, reverend the baptist
We light a book of matches, no one could catch us dozin'
We got our focus frozen, German Shepherds they opposin'
Zombies are jaded and supernaturally we animated
Out for blood and guts and every cut that you contaminated
And those infected hunt the uninfected while we in a bunker
Saying come and get it, rummaging through melee weapons
Now keep it calm wielding maces and police batons
Most our people gone, walking dead with bloody sneakers on
Fuck it's too late to free 'em, Rage virus Ozzie Guillen
Omega men they call us, last of the human beings
Picture that this is the metaphor of true MCing
Only a few remain, the rest won't use their brain
Ready, aim, jugular vein, they'll bite anything, insane
The dead zone is the same


"How interesting"
"But they always throw in a body"
"In the dead zone"
"Walk straight but don't walk late"




That summer... the summer '88 is the best...
But that's your nostalgia though
"Just for the nostalgia," you gotta say
That's my most nostalgic moment of hip-hop music ever
Right


I'll just sit right here and sing that good, old-school shit to you
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own
Oh baby you know
All that lovemaking we did
Boy, it was so real, I wanna feel that again
Long lost friend from way back when
Eric B was president
Tell me where the melody went
And if you still care, say ''yeah, yeah, yeah''
Sing it like I used to do
This one is for me and you, oh


La-di-da-di-da-di-da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
And oh baby, you know
Make love
Thats how you do it
Just like you did it back then
This is dedicated to you


I'll just sit right here and sing that good old school shit to you
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own
Oh baby you know, that love making we did
Boy, It was so real, I wanna feel that again
Loyal friends from way back then
Tell me can you vision us
36 Chambers high
Feels like were there, yeah yeah yeah
Remix of a fantasy, I hear em singing back to me like...


La-di-da-di-da-di-da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
And oh baby you know. make love
Thats how you do it
Just like you did it back then
This is dedicated to you


Nah, we dont wish todays game was old again
We just wish it wasnt full of Draconian, Babylonian, phony men
FOH my summation fascinates, we have debates
Whos the greatest living or passed away
I ask MC, see what she has to say
Eric B or Master P, some see it differently
87 meant to me? I try to describe it, you try to relive it
I try to revive it hoping that you get it, yeah
Something about La Di Da Di got inside our bodies
Something about My Adidas coming out the speakers
Used to do the Wop or the Pee-Wee Herman
Rest in peace Heavy D, Moneyearnin Mount Vernon
Lets go


La-di-da-di-da-di-da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
And oh baby you know
Make love
Thats how you do it
Just like you did it back then
This is dedicated to you


Oh baby you know
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you




My music go harder than those foolish buffoons you know
Spit the rudest flow, never stoop low for stupid hoes
Fresher than ya new clothes, Winter in Chicago, boy
I'm too cold


I'm too bold, attackin' like I'm Cujo
How many times can that gun burst if it's from Earth?
How many stupid food-colored whips are you hopping out in one verse
Tell me again, how many (Ladies!) are you slayin'?
When you really watchin PornHub clips with fifty-two percent ratings
My mind's all-smart, it's in the ball park as Jean-Paul Sartre
Yours is in the parking lot of Walmart
Bagging Duck Dynasty wall-art
You claiming that you move the clubs, but only in a golf cart
Czar, hold the mic


Like Picasso paint a picture in 1080p
(Tell 'em) High res, wide lens, you ain't screen
Crowd goin' wild like they screamin' for they favorite team
Amphetamines give shakes to the fiends
He's the General Zod, fleein' from a federal charge
Next surgery - sue due to head nods
Certified worker, sir, I salute the god
The next generation Jean-Luc Picard


You know, this is sort of well-recorded L
Nosey neighbors tell the board of health that the corpses smell
In the bloody Jordans  to Orson Welles
Ain't nobody tryna hear you like an orphan's yell
I'm rugged
Like a tortoise shell, you rugged like a stuffed one
You bust guns, never flow cold as ice
We keep the merchandise


Movin' like a hundred U-hauls
Screw y'all, call me a bully
The industry is like the school hall
Who are y'all? You're goof balls
Dudes rockin' RuPaul shawls
(CZARFACE) kids, what y'all call raw


Deviatin' septums
Rippin' out doozles
Walkin' out the winner
Beatin' the best

We snack on danger and we dine on death!

..




The way that momma raised us was pure faith
So diablo wouldn't faze us or daze us
Or lay us down to sleep
Know the wolf from the sheep
Or the sheep who cried wolf
And threw the deadly hoof
While the wolf was asleep
I keep my mind a ghost
Follow my heart the most
Don't play fools too close
Sleep with my eyes at post
So Diablo won't be hostin the game of life
The knife sits by throats of the young
And blows death straight through the lungs
As the mind gets washed by visions of sugar plums
But we shall overcome cause we ain't dumb
But we ain't smart, they got the girls by the hearts
And the niggas by the nuts
Ear, tongue and butts
Yeah, they're trying to fuck us up
But, shit, you know what's up
We gotta get with the movement
And move men soon
They consume every womb who bares
Beneath the stairs of their doom
Best believe they're gonna shove em in a tomb

Chorus: repeat 4X

Cause everytime I step to the microphone
I put my soul on 2 inch reels
That I don't even own


Early Saturday mornin I was cartoon gazin
Slowly broke into the kitchen
To fill a bowl with some Raisin Bran
As I ran up and down the TV stations
I witnessed Indian Joe
Getting tricked out of this nation
By a silly hillbilly
Who laughed as the shit happened
Everything's the same
The game continued into rappin
Deception is at an all-time high
You give a piece of your soul
To receive some crumbs from the pie
But you know I keep on rappin til the break of dawn
Even though it is my soul that I do not even own

Chorus: repeat 4X


I was po', black and broke
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
Ass-out, wide open waitin for my shit to come on out
Speakin about the time before I got signed
I was coolin behind Coolio in the County Line
My big brother used to say I was an asshole
Didn't graduate, couldn't handle the hassle
Of high school, why fool
Wit' foolish rules and guidelines
Fuck the cap and tassels
Said forget the trade and tried rhymes
Hooked up with J-Swift, got with 2-4-2
Me and my nigga L.A. Jay back at S.C.U
I grab the MIC one-time
Check it, 1-2, we in
Freakin' major flavors with my fellow Nubians
Takin shit to the next level
Too bad I sold my soul to the fuckin devil




Hehehe, you know I guessed it
You would be the only one
Who would dare to come here, you got courage
Huh, hmm, before you get a chance to fight with me
You must observe our rules, and meet these two swordsmen first


Whatchu know about steppin' out the crib like it's 20 thousand
And all fives, dust still in the fridge
Either or, yo, I rock like a meteor
Bitches know when the kid's high cause I fuck with the TV on
Winter time blowing, had the suede boxers
Petite fillers for the whole team, eight watches
Ladies and gents, watch me, every line is snake venom
Creepin' up on your brain like Excedrin
Blowing out veterans with a speech impediment
So underground I stay beneath the crevices
Bitter wars over coke stores
Arabian jewelers keep hitting me off for the cross
Shiek's wealthy princes and ayatollah
All I gotta do is kick a verse, they like hold this
You my nigga, dun, word to the light on the phoenix sun
Want you to take my daughter, give your queen a son


Halt, you leap me? That's right, I have heard you're the master of dragon's sword Right, hahaha, maybe, but try me


NY fitted, Jordan 13's on the feet
Splash blood on my threads, how I murder the beat
Like medicine to infants, out of they reach
In a charcoal seven with the chardonnay seats
Now my name ring, I played the born, and bare the storm
Now I made king, I weigh my arm, and they respond
Stay gone off that haze and Don, game long like
Triple overtime, overtime stay strong
The great one, fake none, put it on the Bible
See me face to face, look me in my eyes, deuce
Spartacus flow, soul cookies in the vinyls
Only time I go soft, raw pussy on the cycle
Your highness, INS, darts catch your body
And all a nigga saw was the sparks from the tommy
Papis split the fishscale raw, copping polly
Big brother Rollie on Deck, got it roxy


My rap is like a holy drug cart, documented in my sentence
Around the edges, sold my presence of my life beginning
For born bloody swarm, early to a Godly finish
To naysayers throwing stones, hoping I'll diminish
The skies open, til I rose from three or four dimensions
With great rings, less then the dollars the grave bring
Meet the afterlife, chapters I write, with great king
A spiritual , hearing from beyond
They talk to me through a cloth coofie, Lord's beauty
And I'll admit through gems of life, I lost jewelry
Amongst the land dwellers, never trust what a man will tell ya
They give you stone for bread, you found dead
With no dog to smell ya, passing acid in your liquor glasses
When they pour it, have you throwing up blood and courage
Just a week ago, you spotted them walk in
With your enemy, and you recall it
They wasn't mean mugging, they were talking, plotting on you
But God made me unnormal, your diary rise
Breathing the immortal


It was mean, while I'm fixing
His identity, overthrown by the republicans
But our people are still suffering, I am determined
To reorganize this justice, to help our people
By overthrowing the republicans
So help me to regain our position
We will overcome the republicans






Sitting in this library, man
Reading these fucking books
Britannica Encyclopedias, L. Ron Hubbard, Tony Robertson
These muthafuckas, you know what I'm saying?
Sheek Louch

Glasshouse
I reside by the library
Yves Saint Laurent frames
Sipping Ciroc berry
Burning the big dutch, sweet feet up
Long ashes hanging off the blunt, then I pluck
Fell back power napping
Stones they cover my bones
Bricks laying on my pinkie like tombstones
Unbutton my shirt, unloosen my tie
Got the fireplace up real high
Cuban maid sliding me cookies, tall glass of lemonade
Chandeliers hanging over my head
Sitting like a cloud of haze
Larry King on mute
They about to bury Wesley for taxes
Then shot across the two
Then I grabbed the remote, hit the volume on the big lion
The screens in his mouth, a ninety inch giant
Went to commercial, the phone rang
Yo, what up Sheek?
Aint nothing, Tone, just on my dean
Out here in Queens, I bag me a queen
Fed her all this shit she wanted to hear, she probably want the ring
True!


Yeah, different time zones, thats all
I mean, Im over here across seas
You over there in the States
You over there, but either way we gotta get this money, fam
Yo yeah

On the tenth floor, looking over Paris
My neighbors all embarrassed
Cuz Im ass naked, watching the clock
He hating, but his wife steady watching my cock
Different time zones, steering wheel on the right
Driving down the wrong street thinking what the fuck Im gon eat tonight?
White women laying in my bed
I can make a documentary on what race can give the best head
Rae hit me on the text
Told me that he like that new shit, last night, that he heard on Flex
Alright cool, hit me up when you get down to Brazil
If the weathers right, fuck it, I come down to chill
I got a briefcase of Euros and Indian money
Every time Im in customs, they look at me funny
Yeah


Im out in South Beach, 1st street, Ocean Ave
AMG6 with the oak dash
Live the VIP life, I aint spend a clam
I got weight on the spot, thats "instagrams"
Pretty boos in Jimmy Choo's with titties loose
In the mood, getting nude in the swimming pool
Im doing my thing, how Im repping, they salute king
And they dont even know Im Wu-Tang
Name heavy, phone call to my ace Diego
For anything, what up, man? Connect me
I snatch bank like four, five, six
Deuce high, watch a dude ride, Im on my shit
Up in Mansion, salute, world famous Inspectah
Click large, homey, put some more tables together
Wild for the night, I aint even think about my flight
I got some bitches and they tripping off that powder white
Aiyo yo yo, kiss each other, yo




We gon' take this back, crazy old school
Off the head one time, get a DJ something to a--
Chika-chika-chika-chika-chicka-chicka-chhhh

Jazz Joyce, DJ Clue, Cocoa Chanel
Irief Jamel, I rocks the mic well, well
Rock the mic well, well, well..


On and on, to the break of dawn
Hot Butter on, say what? The popcorn
Freak 'em to the left, while we rock 'em to the right
Brooklyn in the house, who wanna fight?
Can we bounce? Roll to the skate, ya rock?
Hip to the hop and ya don't dare stop
Come alive party people, gimme what you got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
Fine, I'm the ninth member of the bunch
Rockin' old school ain't shit to me
MC's OD on the shit that I wrote
Can we smoke while I'm drinkin'? I'm thinkin' of bonin'
Sugar, I wanna ride yo ass until the mornin'
Leave ya moanin: Jamel Irief, High Chief, comin' outta East Medins


Ladies in the house if ya clockin' Gs
Sippin' on drink, Long Island Iced Teas
Lookin' real good from ya toes to ya weave
Tell the fellas back up and like let ya breathe
Fellas in the house if ya know ya live
Punch niggas in the face from Cali to Bed-stuy
Handlin' the steel if the shit get real
Just flip a pie and stack ya mil'


Activation, mind starts sparkin'
Constant elevation, sky walkin'
David Thompson, my Wu niggas stompin'
Down the boulevard, shakin' yo ass
You better watch yo self, I'm type slick
With a nice size --- lemme see you work it
She wanna suck it in public
Ol' Dirty Bastard can use it on the visitings, you wit it?
Then holla like wheels on a peel, don't squeal
Just keep it on the 'lils, for the Masta Kill
Just givin' you somethin' that y'all can feel
I see you in the hood, then ya fam from Tilden
Slid through the back of the buildin', heat concealed in
Stare to your place
Rae bomb the elevator, an Incarcerated Scarface, here, taste
The lace from the dominant race to the base
In ya face like paste, baby doll
Uh, uh, uh, uh, yes yes y'all
Welcome to the block party, shots lick off
You might wanna hit the deck, but stay calm
It's only us, every thing's still well plush
We freakin' the streets, the Shiek shows the beat 


One two, one two
I'mma try this one more time, son
Lemme in there, yo put that nigga back son
(Yeah, hit hard)


Like... hip hop, like socialize
Clean out ya ears and ya open ya eyes
Liquid Sword to the city
Peace Allah Just, that's one of the committee
Let's hook up the 6 for a chess contest
Relieve a little stress
I'll snatch a bag of the Uptown's best
Make ya love it when ya smell it
It's the velvet, block of chocolate for a hundred
Dread' got pounds, if ya wanna get down
Or we can catch 'em on the next round
My universal sound is like world reknowned
World reknowned, world reknowned
My universal sound is like world reknowned 






Psycho LES, what's good?
It's like my nigga Dirty would say
"Come on, baby baby, come on, baby baby, come onnnnnnnnnn"


I make shots ring, watch poppa swing
I said I shine in the mind, plus the watch and ring
I get down, when I do my thing
I get down, when I do my thing
Little hot thing, wanna rock the king
So I put the stroke through her, and broke the box spring
I don't play, when I do my thing
I don't play, when I do my thing


Who the block king, nuff rocks and things
Any spot that I pop, cause tops to spin
Any spot that I rock, got a pop for grin
For my thugs thats locked in the box and bing
I rip the roof off, this dude's the boss
To start a war, we can fly and catch my music off
I said I'm like Skywalker, when I use the force
Got a broad on my side when I cruise my porsche
Cross state line, all drapped in shine
I make minds with the tape, or the cakes or pies
Shopping fives on you mami, how you shake your thighs
Girl you fronting, you ain't cutting, why you waste your time?
I hit the Power-U, for bout an hour or two
Girl you treat me like a champ, bow down to you
I said you treat me like a champ, like you now my boo
Smash it, no attachments, is how I do




Now watch Deck go, rep sets for dough
I spend time with a dime, I don't sweat no ho
Son shine with the rhyme, yeah, Deck's a pro
And since I lived the wild life, yeah, checks'll blow
Come and test I, many heads'll fly
I said enough men'll die and the best'll try
Any bets on the side, that's a bet for I
Pep step with a glide and I rep my side
Get your bounce on, we be out til dawn
And I'mma bounce with a tall chick around my arm
In the porsche, wicking off with an ounce of charm
You were try'nna play that wall shit, you now went wrong
Poppa got this, go pop your Cryst'
I said, even super thug gotta rock to this
She was creeping through the club, I spot ya miss
Is you dancing to the song, or is you riding the (riding the)




Just do your thing..
New York niggas do your thing..
Out of town niggas do your thing..
Over seas niggas do your thing..
Yeah, we in the place..
Unda Dogz, UD'z, Urban Icon..
You dig?




Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop


Cash rules everything around me, I'm fresh out the slum
Rich bum nigga, now I live dumb
Talking 'bout that cream
Leaning in the Tower of Pisa
Seven visas, got condos in the jungle
The mind stay rich but the pockets is well-filled
Let's violate this lil' area, get milk
I'm telling you, man, you don't want no part of this, fam
Get punched in the water like clams
KKK, slices, they one of the nicest
Stainless steel, sharp swords, dipped in ricin
Everybody eating, everybody full
Just a young bull lighting a Phillie, still a willy
Ball on 'em, in the Bentley with the wall on 'em
Yo, I'll sleep when I'm dead, like the hood, homies
Who get it cracking in the park, homes?
Park Hill narco, smoke and let the bones turn to charcoal
Let's get richer, kid
Signature Louis Rich, won't stop until there's billions in this bitch


Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop


I grew up on the rhyme side, that "gotta get mine" side
That white girl, we mix it with quinine
You players try and ball from the sidelines
While I'm aging like fine wine, you internet thuggin' somebody timeline
Between love and hate is a fine line
And these habitual line steppers can die trying
A New York Islander, my clique's NY Giants
A pocket full of NY (K)nicks for my clients
Y'all ain't buying, stop crying and stop lying
Hakuna Matata, no Mufasa, I'm not lion
You try to spit on that hot iron, you not iron
The irony 'cause that last shot just shot by him
So let's start it with this, son, motivate him with this one
If you ain't got no haters, go get some
Is anybody greater? There is none
Assorted 'Now And Laters', my clan got too many flavors to pick from


Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop


Deuce high when I start my game
It's like, you should see it live dog, all you see is sparks and flames
I grab bags and I park my ways, the way I have 'em all locked
You would think they gave they heart to bae
Bet on us, baby, ain't no better odds to play
It's hard to fake, my real life is on display
Either love or hate whatever part you play
I take the best of both worlds like R. and Jay
Own boss, no third party
Produce more murder than Irv Gotti
Like I'm working on my third body
Deck, kill it quick
24/7 bed rest, that's how ill it get
Can't stop if I mash the brakes
Got the cash it takes, I might flash my face
Half an eighth got me floating like I'm trapped in space
Not safe for your workplace, a basket case


Don't stop, never stop
Can't stop getting this guap
Fat money knot, hammer cock, curry hot
Cook a fool, hit the block
No shorts, bring it back
Flipping this, stack that
Free it up, weigh it up
Don't stop, never stop
Can't stop getting this guap
Fat money knot, hammer cock, curry hot
Cook a fool, hit the block
No shorts, bring it back
Flipping this, stack that
Free it up, weigh it up
Quest for success with my mind on my money
Came a new rhyme saying "Wu-Tang is the best"
Music
Yeah, peace to Khaled

Dialogue


Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop
Don't stop, never stop, can't stop




Yeah, I ride til I blew wit the case, through the days
Use the ways, niggas talk til they blue in the face
Been struggling is nothing to me, come and see
I get it in, like Kobe at the buzzer for three
When I'm gone, better twenty one gun it, thousand dollar bottles pop
One of the best that ever done it
Broke nights dumbing with the dumbest, sporting the fourth floor
I bought it from fiend for seven hundred
New faces, screwfacing niggas from a distance
One time, wait to take a nigga through the system
I ain't got time to play, I hit the globe on roam
I'm still home a million miles away
And I grind so my seeds could eat, sometimes
I let my eyes close, and I daydream of sleep
And if I should die before I wake, then before my wake
Hit my wifey off with all my cake
Til then, I'mma live it up, pop corks and split a dutch
Walking on the wild side, just to get a rush
Ya'll better get in touch, laws ain't shit to us
Every one I know is God, Earth, King, Crip or Blood
Little nigga listen up, I know you loving the life
Of living it fly, so how you can't get enough
Son said, who gives a fuck, they see I'm making my bread
Escaping the feds, so why should I give it up?


Ain't nothing left to do but
Throw myself down in these streets and
If I feel like niggas test me
I'm gon' reach out for my piece and
I don't run from confrontation
By myself I keep it true
When it comes down to getting paper
I'm gon' do what I gotta do


I seen million dollar niggas fall flat on they face
Best friends, co-defendants, how you rat on your ace?
Scramblers chase, the blood money's, hammers on waist
Just to trick on the chick, with the candles and lace
Believe it, it's real, we all out, fiending for meals
Food shot up on the block, left them bleeding there still
Nothing worse than, power in the hands of fools
They play the game but, they don't understand the rules
Yo, you should understand the jewels, I got my life on the line
There's a 50/50 chance to lose
Aiyo, my dude, it's bigger than me, but as the story go
Why buy the cow when you get it for free
To make a living, it's either death or state prison
Deck just ain't quitting, either rep or stay hidden
Ya'll know the motto, hollow points follow you home
Al Capone cats, swallow the chrome
You get blown back out of your zone, like pow to the dome
So watch your mouth, kid, mind on your tone
Son I ate with the greatest, stayed with the latest
Eye for an eye, boss, ain't with the favors
I laid where they murk all day, broad day
I said flames will dispurse ya'll way, ya'll play
Deep inside the game, wise guys die for they name
While the organized mind, stay quietly paid






Do you really want it, do you really?
(House Gang on the chow)
Do you really want it, do you really?
(Get ya plates out, we 'bout to eat now)
Do you really want it, do you really?
(First in line, the fugitive)
Do you really want it, do you really?
(Carlton Fisk, geeee!)


House Gang on the chow, last warning
Cuffs and ID's, now we walkin' out
New York City, I'm a animal, stalkin' about
Fuck around with the fuck around, blood in ya mouth
And I rep for them green haven, cats who smuggle grams
Bubble in the yard with they fam
The type to send money home on the pink slip, whenever they can
You the type to turn day in the can, bitch the wave of my hand
Have you runnin' with your face in your hand
Threw the mess hall, as fast as you can
Mothafucka, Carlton Fisk, Karl Malone when I'm settin' the shit
Donnie Cash, Jason Kidd, when he on the assist
And we Loose Linx, House Gang, who's fuckin' with this?


Do you really want it, do you really?
(Yeah, we in the yards)
Do you really want it, do you really?
(Gangstas shoot time, our own weight like workin' ants)
Do you really want it, do you really?
(Eyo, I'm 'bout to send this kite out to my nigga King Just)
Do you really want it, do you really?
(Eyo Just, hold me down baby)
Do you really want it, do you really?
(Yo, come on!)


I do what it takes to carry the whole weight
Ya'll the crumbs on the table, while we the fuckin' whole cake
Battle ya whole state, off of one dub plate
I.N.S. we goin' platinum, off of one mixtape
Get ya shit straight, before you be floatin' the cold plate
The big fish eat the small bait
The sharp knife cut the dull steak
The seven wonders of the world, and King J is the eighth
Stay in ya place, and bout face
I ain't gon' loose the race, steady pace
I'm a carpenter rapper, I keep hammers on my waist
Drink Remy by the case, and smoke trees that's laced
I get that ass robbed without the base
Make you leave the game alone like you Pastor Mase
We the All Madden greats, we the planet of the apes
We the reasons why DJ's gotta dig in they crates
For given sake, hit it, only take one tape
As if I'm down on my last, we gon' cook back the shake
And double back to an eighth, I cause trouble for my papes
In the food fight you couldn't bust a grape
This goes out to the late, and the ones that can relate
Welcome to Park Hill, home of the fire escapes


Do you really want it, do you really?
(10304, all that war)
Do you really want it, do you really?
(We got the ninth floor on lock right now)
Do you really want it, do you really?
(Come see us, House Gang, yeah)
Do you really want it, do you really?
(Sendin' the kite out to my nigga D.C.)
Do you really want it, do you really?
(Yo Donnie, meet me on the gate son)


The Animal handles business on the zone
Call for knowin', like I got no minutes on the phone
All I need is the spinnach and the chrome
A couple of clips, couple of whips, got me spinnin' on the chrome
Catch a vick, run up in a nigga home
Clap up his chick, wrap up the bricks, then I empty in the dome
You's a bitch, I can sense it in your tone
Your bitch is a whore, and I'm a dog, wanna tempt me with a bone
But the only thing I'm meant to is a dome
I'm usin' a moose cat to booth cracks, then I send her home
Court dates, face sentencing alone
And never did I tell with the jail, did the bidding on my own
Since 12, I've been livin' on my own
From D.C., originally, never needed ya'll is written on my bones
Like, ain't nobody kiddin' when you grown
And don't respect your visions 'till you show em, then they miss you when your gone
My life is like a scripture in a poem, if not in the cell
Then where I dwell is like a prison of it's own
You can tell, I'm bout to into to a zone
The sum is 'bout as high as I'mma get, still twistin' up a bone




Yo, this is a Wu-Banger two thousand and one noise maker
Off the hook guerilla anthem
This is DJ Kay Slay, from around the way
And I'll smack the shit outta ANY OF YOU DJ's
That front on this shit.. think I'm playin?

 (x2)
I heard you ladies got them thangs thangs, do you really?
I heard y'all niggas like to bang bang, do you really?


I never been a fan of the fame, I got love for the game
Never lust for the dames, I got dust in my veins
Little off in the brain, kid talks butter slang
Sniffed a little blow with the rap Eddie Kane
Spent a lot of dough, it's so hard to explain
And I fucked a lot of hoes off the strength of the name
Wu-Tang, see me at the next, X Winter Games
Snowboardin down a ski range, it's a blue and grey frame
Keep, pointin the finger, I'm that nigga to blame
The main reason why you tuck the chain
Self proclaimed, got a lotta profit to gain
And I'm leavin the rap game the same way I came


Now creep with me, as I roll through the Stat
Little Meth got my back, so do Pinky Fat-Fat
Let me hit that  contact, learn how to act
Before you bring that drama the end; now fade to black
Positive, hate kids who tell me lies
Despise guys that wanna get high but never buy
Got nine lives, nine wives that don't listen
Bitchin their biological clocks is tickin
Wu limited edition - hot off the presses
I guess it's, curtains for competition
Method, runnin 'em out, gun in my mouth
The kid your momma warned you about, tear down the house
After midnight, eatin MC's, change to a gremlin
You're tremblin, behind the Kremlin wall, surrenderin
That's what you get for Russian/rushin, in the direction I was bustin
Polish your sword, your shit is rustin

 (x2)
I heard you ladies got them thangs thangs, do you really?
I heard y'all niggas like to bang bang, do you really?


One-two, testin, testin, mic check wreckin
Steps into the session
Automatic weapon off safety, don't play me
But brings all them things with silencers
My clan is liver than your average '85er
Strive to stay alive
I play for keeps in the streets
Cause it's real on the battlefield
Shells hit the ground from the steel
Bullets travel, sun set fire to your mind
Words combine when I rhyme to free the blind
Prepare my queen for battle and walk down
I drink from the wine of violence, no tolerance
Gave word bond, sword silence
Me in military fatigues, bulletproof underneath
Buy enough ammunition to round and sweep the streets
Of Brooklyn, central, sugar-whipped the rental
While I'm lickin out the window at y'all, fuck y'all

 (x2)
I heard you ladies got them thangs thangs, do you really?
I heard y'all niggas like to bang bang, do you really?


Yo, we thrive on street life, we strive to eat right
They blind and need sight, we tried to be nice
They talk the small talk, we walk the long walk
We lost, they all thought, they forced to fall short
We rock for hard rocks, rocked the hot blocks
Shop and cop rocks, watch the top notch in action
Begin to make your head spin
Wu-Tang my brethren, we bang like veterans
They paid for record spins, taste the medicine
Or face the double M, we came to trouble them
Hustle them for they 20 mill' then buckle them
'Nuff to spin out the blue, bitches lovin them
Dozen men with force of a hundred-ten
Stumblin thug passions, it must've been

 (x4)
I heard you ladies got them thangs thangs, do you really?
I heard y'all niggas like to bang bang, do you really?




Ohh mad one, we see your trap
You can never escape your fate
Submit with honor to a duel with my son
I agree

I see you're using an old style
I wondered where you'd learned it from
You know very well, it's yours too
Heh, I had forgotten, will you show me?
And what have you come for?
You come here, since you're so interested - fight me


Yo, Picture bloodbaths and elevator shafts
Like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft
Check the print, it's where veterans spark the letterings
Slow moving MC's is waiting for the editing
The liquid soluble that made up the chemistry
A gaseous element, that burned down your ministry
Herbal vapors and biblical papers
Smoking Exodus, every square yard is plush
Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions facial expression
Leaves impressions, try to keep a shark nigga guessing
Give crazy shouts Son here's the outcome
Cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss
Shit is outdated, just like neckloads of Sterlings
Suede-fronts, bell-bottoms, and tri-colored Shearlings
I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular homicides
On July 4th in Bed-Stuy
Where money don't grown on trees and there's thieving MC's
Who cut-throat to rake leaves
They can't breathe, blood splash, rushing fast
Like running rivers, I be that whiskey in your liver


Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!


This is not a '85 affair made clear
When the Gods get on to perform storms blew up
Wu's up, causing the crowd to self-destruct
Killer Beez are stinging while I reveal
Science that's heavily guarded by the culprit
Bombing your barracks with aerodynamic
Swordplay, poison darts by the doorway
Minds that's laced with explosive doses
Damaging lyrical launcher
Lunge at the youthful offender then injure
Any contender, testing the murderous Master
Could lead to disaster, dynamite thoughts
Explode through your barrier, rips the retina
Who can withstand the astonishing punishing
Stings to the sternum, shocked in the Hip Hop livestock
Seeking for a serum to cure em


Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Ducking handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move like real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six-oh
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Building lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, Ki's in they vaginas
No peace, yo the police mad corrupt
You get bagged up, depending if you're passing the cut
Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's living heartless
Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest
Individual, critical thoughts, criminal minded
Blinded by illusion, finding it confusing




Huh, Master, he must be dreaming, heh
Well, if he is dreaming then he must be asleep
And if he's asleep, then I will wake him up!

At the height of their fame and glory, they turned on one another
Each struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy
In the passion and depth of their struggle
The very art that had raised them to such Olympian heights was lost
Their techniques vanished





Yo its major when my pen touches the paper
Im the fall guy lee majors
You minor, we major
Im stunning I got these fans fainting in the front row
I keep the blunt rolled, the true stories untold
But keep in mind, Im the greatest of all time
The flows on beat, and my verse is on time
From Killa Queens I got that potent shit that killing fiends
I never snitch, even in handcuffs I wont spill the beans
Player this is real shit, I move the crowd with real spit
This is my turf, youre just here visiting on a field trip
Im a pimp allergic to shrimp so I dont need it
I might eat the coochie out before I beat it
The mission to get a million dollar commission without selling out
And keeping the tradition
I dont like to fuss, you dont want to fight with us
If you wanna take it there youre gonna bite the dust



Throw in the towel this is a murder most foul
When the verses go blaow
Heavy lies the cowl, of the king; the ruler;
Overlord; the jeweler
But this aint a rope chain its cooler
Yo this lands my Dominion
Ya man is a minion, listen
This aint for your girl to see this between the world and me
My style is, coast the page with the malice
Im an ink slinger you a drink bringer get my chalice
I stand and fight, my stance is panther-like
Cold world   the same shade of anthracite
Look and see bars are candy coated maybe sugar free
My acapella a novella I should be on Book TV
I go to war but I radiate peace
I got faith in your release like an atheist priest
You cant baby a beast
The laboratorys dark, the sword is sharp
Longer than a 40 part story arc



Yours truly ruley Step through em, do em fools
Quick, opening credits still in the movie
My persona you can feel in the next room
Deeper than most, this was ghost-written by Neptune
Step on the scene make them lean on promethazine
My glow bright I flow tighter than Vanessa jeans
Ear surgery when they heard mines
And Im stuck to the city like Wayward Pines
So I spit that real cause it get that real
Overtime on the grind to get that meal
Fam holla when you cut some bread
Cause other than the money I aint heard nothing you said
I zone like an NBA team in the 2-3
Laid up at your bae crib steaming a QP
Say go when I take control
No they cant escape my bars like a con who aint make parole



Level Electric 1




(There...there?)
One more game
Yo, uh huh uh huh
Staar
Surround sounder, blunt smokin, remy downer
Hip-hop sizzar slingin my raw in your flounder
You get skidawed, undertakin' undergrounders
This lyricist, lounge with low, that be lounger
Aliens is out of townish, fuck applause
Niggas clap now with forty pounders, and fourty-fours
Is it all, fair in love with war
Young 'uns with guns, acting like they taking yours, uh
Live by the sword, they gonna die by the sword, uh
My vocal cords break the laws that apply to nature
Low and these niggas love to hate ya
Request the henney straight no chaser
Twin towerin' I skyscrape ya
Now gimme yours


Trifled disciple, arch rival reppin with weapons that homicidal
Star leaves you marked from the start like tribal scars
(Allah punk) I'm hazardous as a bomb and arms spinnin' like Christ
Recitin' psalms in the streets of Babylon
(Verbs I gather well) ??? data shells
My squad camoflauge your wealth
Like the bible with parabels
With the navigator, spittin razor sharp, breath laser data
That'll tickle you now, but sway you later


On this one call me Lee Major
Million dollar man, bionic or proffesor chronic
Still not a player, I just fuck alot the panty raider
Get shortys mad, they curse you wild on your sky pager
Stankin' ass


Yo Mr. Big Mouth, better duck down or bite the bullet
You niggas got guns but you scared to death to pull it
Bet if I pull my gun I'm gon' squeeze
I'm startin at your head, son, and stoppin' at your knees
I hate your screwmugs, rumble counterfeit thugs
Niggas want mine, bet they come and get it in blood
Fat potential, gave birth to a corrupt mental
Foul thoughts paralyzin temples, it's just that simple

Chorus

You better come with your best gun
Niggas be holdin', it's all war no fun
Niggas be bowlin', you niggas under pressure now
My squads down for whatever with whoever now
Let's get it on
Best to come with your best gun
Niggas be rollin', it's all war no fun
Niggas be holdin', you niggas under pressure now
My squads down for whatever with whoever now
Let's get it on


Arm leg shots to hit the spot like a four fifth Glock
We got this hip-hop shilock and all you clique got
Was lip lock, heavy heat, steady street sweepin your peeps
Hawks, machete chops puttin' cease to your petty fleets
This raw rebel got more metal than pop
And rock groups, when my Glock shoots the scores settled
A ground attack, I'm bound to clap rounds of rap
Clowns are found flat, face down around the map
Simple minds, cripple smiles, my rhymes are four five
The size oh two nines combine, can't even tickle mine


I told you once, I told your ass a thousand times, chump
Body in the trunk, stay in line punk
Fuck wit me and mine


Yo
You be the actual, sixteen bars, comin' after you
Never go against my team, they might embarrass you
Slit-slang terrorist talk, fully armed
Put your hands up, I'mma put a hole in your paws
Ruin your side show, eyes low, brains fried from hydro
Two choices, bass off or either die slow
We all scholars when it's time to clean a dirty dollar
Attack the boards, it's like a rotweiler


Niggas comin out they shoes like they Usher
These motherfuckers on the run, and they socks from
The bounty hunter, Iron Lungster, rain and thunder
Here come the lightning now I'm strikin' back at niggas bitin'
Pushin' buttons just to step away from self-destruction
Inch and a half away from touchin' somethin'
Suckin' away from bustin'
Yall brothers laugh now and cry later
I rap from Alpha to Omega, sixty four to Sega
Whoopin' that ass, walk you dogs through the lookin' glass
Been burnin' MC's since cookin' class
Makin' it hot like the summer in the crackspot
With blacktops, my nickle slot, triple bar, hit the jackpot
On each block, I'm the remedy, send them back to me
After detock, shorty got knuckles in the Reebok
Plus we got a problem with the Benz
(What's the problem with the Benz)
She want the six-hundred, but she ain't got the ends

Chorus

You better come with your best gun
Niggas be holdin', it's all war no fun
Niggas be bowlin', you niggas under pressure now
My squads down for whatever with whoever now
Let's get it on




Elevation (x15)


Tired of trials and tribulations
It seems like life is Hell, dreams the only way of escapin
To worlds that's beyond imagination
I know a place, I could take you there through elevation


Where I come from young ones pump jums for lump sums
Bustin guns, trust none, become son
Truth spells broke loose shells that propel
Where I'm dwellin, niggas bail, tellin what you sellin
My nigga Tone just came home but improvised
The system tried to give him 5 more for gettin high
Fly Stacy, daddy's little lady fucks crazily
Baby after baby, lost her shape as of lately
Used to spend the quiet nights home, now she likes to roam
Feelin quite grown, caught in like cyclones
I was taught be the wise of glide and I'll impass
To advance, learn the science of life and earn the masters
Trapped in the havoc, I'm forced to go the whole
Although, it might spell a jail cell and no parole
I fight with the force of Steve Austin
Until my arms can no longer hold off the coffin
In this ghetto Heaven, God bless the children
Whose shattered dreams are offered and hard to mend
We don't believe in Heaven, we livin in Hell
Tryin to escaped, but fate's sealed in the bomb shell
Feelin like U'ey, he knew they would pnat the plot
When high-tech surveillance got my moves on watch
So, I drop jewels, use the music to educate
Can't celebrate 'til we elevate








And Imma tell you something again


You done made it again
Back again
Back again
Back again
Back again
Back again

Yeah... yeah... Allah Math...
Yeah... yo... yo...


Y'all ain't never stopping the kid, why y'all knocking the king?
Would ya like a shot of liquor or like a shot to the rib?
Plus you stay on top of they grills, stay on top of they biz
Thinking niggas plotting on hairs, think they not when they is
This is Staten Island gully, you dig? It's getting ugly
And I ain't found a court that can judge me, the block love me
Like nines to the side of the skully, popping they top
I'd rather pop bubbly, one for B.I.G. and one for Pac
Nigga, trust me, I'm hot as they get, like Al Green
Getting hit by a pot of them grits, yo, nahmeen?
Y'all don't really want no parts of this, soon as a nigga
Start shining, niggas start some shit, my guard lit
Like a boss, head nigga in charge, get in these drawers
Fitted, nine inches bigger than yours
This Meth dude got that food, and he serving it raw
Told you before, I bring the pain, and now I'm hurting them, pa
Hurting them, pa...


Up from the 36, back on that bullshit
Okay, I'm reloaded, strapped with a full clip
Staten Island's the borough, Park Hill, we still click
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, that's the Clan, we run shit


Aiyo, you fucking with some capital G's, Allah Math
Streetlife, Meth Man, plus the Masta and me
Soldier I, make it happen, indeed, my sick gift
Had the highest paid ho, get it cracking for free
Worldwide, still trapped in the P's, Pioneers
Like the twenty inch woofers, that's in back of the V
Leave ya brain, like you spazzing on E
It don't matter who you happen to be, nothing swagger like he
Keep a dirty cop close, never talk with no feds
Tear the roof off the mother, right along with ya head
And I ain't talk unless she talking bout bread
You would swear that I'm rocking New Balance, how I'm walking the ledge
Son, I'm just a little off of the edge, as I stalk
The mean streets, for paused types, callers are read
Killa Hill where the warriors bred, I'm a Resident
Patient, it's gonna take more than the meds




Special invited guest, I came to put the rumors to rest
Rip the rest of the slugs through your chest
Put the chest to the back of your vest
Trap your packet, take the money and jet
Niggas posted, but you posing no threat
Punk, you pussy like the opposite sex
Front, see how many shots you will get
I'm not asking, I'm demanding respect
I'm just a man to respect
Watch your step, son, your funeral's next
Streetlife is the man in the flesh, I got one hand on your neck
The other hand is attached to the tech
Your next move could mean life or death
Make move, take baby steps
Hold that thought, nigga, save your breath
We hold courts, in the streets, we rep
For Cash Rule, and we came to collect, cock sucker





"Execute them" 


"Slang bang to wax, torture pack, pump it to max
Till your heart collapse, fully auto rap
Might lose your eye sight, blood type, a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype"


Yeah, y'all mothafuckers know, turn my shit up mothafucker
Wild the fuck out, word up fuck the radio
1998 word up, whippin illegal on y'all beagle-lookin mothafuckers
Yo, James spin off, slang dames wanna hit off
Czechoslovak' lock it down, lames get off
Jury match, range rack, fists of fury-act
Don po, six hundred glow, Wally mack poly like that
It's real ("Execute Them"), diabolical
Logical, strange chokehold, kill is possible
Flip a wig blindfold, rewind the scroll
Clip full-mo, flip on the glow, blow
Rock a arm-fold, tourist a bull report
Sit back, calmful, Timberland cold war
Hailin from my next down, rounds clip clowns
Buyin a loyal bitch gowns, go down, fuck them clowns
While we healin, minds, wheelin labs wit cathedral ceilings
Dryer, hitman for hire, alien flyer
"Slang bang to wax, slang bang to wax, slang slang bang to wax
Torture pack"
What what, step up, throw your sword up


Aiyyo witness the abduction, villa destruction
Blood rushin, from a universal standpoint
A lotta shorties bustin, but they gotta cum some
Before they can test my steel
I send a grandson to let em feel one, bodies not worth my gun
PC don, w-w-MastaKill.com, heavily armed
We roam, through the dark damp litter of the forest
Exploerer lives gold, bless em wit a c-note, throw em overboat
Slit his stomach so the body won't float
The vigilant, infinite patient I stand as commanding chief
Mad thorough, competition's intense from every inch of the borough

"Slang bang to wax, torture pack, pump it to the max
Till your heart collapse, fully auto rap" 
"Might lose your eyesight, bloodtype, a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype
(Execute them) I live to write the hype"


Murder verser, twenty beam rap fiend server
Rhymes nurture minds, bustin like twin burners
Certified live, five million eyes left wide
Inside we split the grand prize
Won it by a landslide, dance by the rest
They fit in contest but they pose no threat
Street corner warrior, cause crowd disorder
And glide like rollerblades 'cross your recorders
Soldier of fortune lost in the madness
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Po' bandit hold the belt single-handed
Most Demanded Assassin is what I'm branded
Far from your standard, universally
Planted jewels in the minds of fools left stranded
One man hit force, my shirt ripped off
Squeeze a full clip to kill the bullshit then I dip off

"Slang bang, slang bang to wax (Execute Them)
Torture pack, pump it to the max till your heart collapse
Fully auto rap, might lose your eyesight, bloodtype a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype"
"Execute them" 
"Slang bang to wax, torture pack pump it to max till your heart collapse"
"Sla-slang bang to wax (Execute them)
Torture pack, pump it to the max till your heart collapse (Execute them)
Fully auto rap, might lose your eyesight, bloodtype a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype
I live to write the hype






You stepped in the pit of the flame
You're lost on Beat Street, I'mma throw spit on your name
Hear the roar when they mention the name
It's like Mike when he score with like two seconds left in the game
Small change don't step in my lane
I rock too hardbody, I click-bang, give 'em the pain
Nah man, can't get with them games
Your boy born with it, so how you gon' get him to change
You a lame putting shit in the game
Piranha wanna see me in the state greens and prisoner chains
But I'm smooth like the groove to the listener brain
And you only understand it if you been through my pain
Icy white spitters in frames
Hustle in my blood, bet my seeds gon' get it the same
Yes indeed I'm destined to reign, so ahead of the game
All aboard y'all get on the train


Banana clip Mac-aholic, I slap your cap then join
Go in the freezer, got a skeezer tits out the toilet
Niggas is Norbits, running up on a dice game, call it
Preacher suit on, holding a raw fifth
Put that call in, his dough in the wall, stall him
Plastic bags laying in the floorway, yep
It's just dog's day, reservoir out in Utah, yo
Where my dope and marijuanas got bought in
Real Nikes, afford 'em, we pay to have a roast
Assassins is strapped, this the only way the yay grows
More leverage, more sevens, riding around with legends
Paying judges off, we be up in New York repping


Miramax movie magic, cold beer on tap, rumor has it
Words put ideas on track
Footprints, I walk on Earth and appear on maps
Strive for at least 2.5 mill a year on cap
Wu Wear on my cap, dime piece on the lap
Three hundred push-ups a day put the crease on your back
Be the cap-fitting lieutenant black man
Who invented chopping samples up, to make the beats that's ascended to
Every genre of music, the whole sphere of music
I produced, arranged, engineered the music


My ear candy been dope, my pen stroke like Zorro
Hit the heavy bag like Foreman in the Congo
Mini transmitter, night vision in the stronghold
Rock long robes, smell snakes with a strong nose
Every time the horn blow the Wu signal's back on
Transform, pack form, a whole 'nother platform
We coming back for 'em to smash the spot, kid
I'm on your team too, pass me the rock
Til the casket drop I'mma flip your wig
Rip clothes, honey didn't know my dick this big
You get kicked in the ribs with two chrome gauge
Deadly venom, I send 'em back to stone age



* iTunes bonus track


What doesn't kill you will only make you get even, aiyo


Everybody talking now, everybody eyes on me
You know how it's going down, you know how I ride, my G


I'm bout to air it out, I don't care about
On lookers in the way, son, clear 'em out
And watch your mouth, or get pounded out
That's without a doubt, the hard way, you found it out
So walk it out, trynna chalk it out
Find yourself with your top row falling out
It's the fallout, and I'm all out
Want it bad with the kid, then call it out
It's on now, it's going down
I'm headchecking like jail niggas on the count
You wanna shout, you balling out
Codename: Paperboy, I stay on the route
Large amounts, I lost the count
Don't be hating, don't be jealous, that's how the baller bounce
I blow 'em out, I show 'em how
What you talking bout, clown, what's it all about?




What you know about, how I throw it down
It's one tenth of my strength, son, I'm holding out
Big blowers out, big hoes about
G Code it out, hazed up, blow an ounce
Then I comb the town, got my toters now
Forever focused, never knowing when a foe's around
I stand overground, my soldiers down
You don't like it, it's the truth, how it suppose to sound
You broken down, I hold my ground
You never thought it like next, but it's over now
I'm posing proud, I'm open now
In the unisex bathroom smoking pounds
Scoping down, a golden brown
Brooklyn queen looking like she down to roll up out
I blow 'em out, I show 'em how
What you talking bout, clown, what's it's all about?






Turn the track up a little bit
We need to rock in here

I wanna make you happy


I'm not at all happy or elated, this category ain't my favorite
It's my story, I'mma state it, you could love it or hate it
I'm just a misfit blessed with good dick and intelligence
Hood nigga holding no grudges on petty shit
I started, why are we cold-hearted, so guarded
Scared to get hurt, trying not to love the hardest
That's garbage, remember when we loved each other
Bathtub scrubbed each other, chillin', champagne spillin'
Uh, feelin' like the shit gon' last forever
Time went so fast, we had a blast together
Laughs we had, friends we spent time with
Now I be seeing your friends out, then I'm reminded
How we all used to gather up for the holidays
Now your friends all nervous to speak, they act afraid
I was your bestie, how it get to this
As I reminisce, takin' off my MJs in my empty crib
Mary...


I wanna make you happy
But you just don't see it
I wanna be around, babe
But I'm so tired of competing
We say all the wrong things
Till we make each other cry
What are we doing?
Will it ever get better?
My heart, my soul
I gave, it's yours
I can't get back
All the things that I lost
Boy, I love you
But you're pushing me away


I gave you everything that I got
Watched my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside


Now I was hoping
We'd get through this together
You said you'd love me
Through all types of stormy weather
Wasn't it you who said
We'd be together for all time
But it keeps messing with my mind
My heart, my soul
I gave, it's yours
I can't get back
All the things that I lost
I need you here near me
But I can't make you stay




I never thought that I would have this feeling
Do you think for once that you can truly mean it
Wasting so much time disagreeing
See, I'm to the point where I don't know what I believe in




If you don't want this, I don't want this, I do my morning crunches
Play my jazz, pray to the east, and watch the sunset
Uh, but yet I was blowin' you up the other night
Could tell your girl was telling you what to write back
Tell me why it's like that


So make up your mind, boy decide
We can't go on like this, this ain't right (it ain't right)
Feeling really bad, feeling kinda low
Think it's time to go






Yo, yo, late night, her click deserted
Time is perfect, she worth it
Femme fetale, pussy cat growl like Eartha Kitt
The first kiss, took my heart and nursed it
Looked her deep into the eyes, she realized beneath the surface
Infatuated lip servant, black aphrodisiac
Cat walked across the floor, her bedroom eyes glanced back
She posed with the Playboy pose, centerfold body rose through her clothes
My love jones rose, the stereo blow, scenario
The lights slow, the hydros rose, 2 totes without the nympho
We went slow, romantic interlude in the nude
Soul Food, dinner for 2, private interview
Silent moans whisper, the bed's bound to break
Pretty brown face, I thought I felt the ground shake
The sound of the rain against the window pane
Drove her insane, her wild heart has now been tamed
Got half a blunt flipped in the train, waitin to inhale
Female packed the banger like she been in jail
As we lay, reflectin on the sweet seduction
A brief interuption occured, her man busted in

*beat switches to a slow '70's soul beat*


You said you was mine, all mine (x4)

*beat switches back*


Femme fetale, pussy cat growl like Eartha Kitt
I'm takin chances, but can't resist how she worked it
She loved it too, left a stamp with my 'W' (What?)
Your other dude got you vexed, call, I'm comin through
Your spot is hot, I did not, reconsider
It's not the nigga she had, but it's the way she had niggas
Now, I'm tangled, caught up in her love triangle
Love it on the sideline, remind when I came through
I blame you, the reason that the flame grew
She threw the pussy like Steve Young from all angles
Carats on her ankle, made niggas break fool
The Power U will trank you, but I remain cool
Yo, I'm showin her love, but it's the fellings I'm avoidin
She was pretty as a wild flower, sweet as poison
Poison will the skull and cross bone, spoke in soft tones
Red bone, both hands wore stones
Plus she home alone, temptin for me to eat the tension
No need to mention, I know, your man's got you tremblin
You feelin threatened, jettin when she needed attention
So, now she give your highness most honorable mention
Femme fetale, pussy cat growl like Eartha Kitt
Femme fetale, pussy cat growl like Eartha Kitt
Femme fetale, pussy cat growl like Eartha Kitt
Femme fetale, pussy cat growl like Eartha Kitt
I'm takin chance, but can't resist how she worked it




(Baby...) Bitch! You know what I want!
(Sweet love.) I wanna talk to Sampson
(Girl... sweet love.. feel.)
I want yo' sweet ?
(Yeah, baby. Sweet love.)
Yeah, BBC status. (Girl.)
Mockin' birds like Zorro
(Feel... baby.. sweet love.)
(Girl... sweet thing... feel what I feel?)


Ghetto princess told me she settled out in Flushin' Meadow
Fly chick rockin' size six stilettos
Drapped-out in tailor made leather and suede
A serenade for the moment, then we part ways
Was a church girl, quiet at home, huggin' the pilow and phone
Now you're grown, rollin' bones, holdin' your own
I admire, attire be bold just like her attitude
Jewels from head to toe, glowin' natural
I'm after you, your style's what I'm attracted to
Really seem to keep it movin' when you do pass thru
Knowin' when we bump heads, we will soon bump hips
To be swimmin' in an ocean of love that sunk ships
Homin' with the tight grip, come thunderous
To wake up reminicisin' and spark the blunt clip
Have you lovin' it, wonderin' if I shall return
Forget me not, enternally the flame burns


Forget me not (Baby, sweet love.)
Forget me not (Girl, feel what I feel?)
(Baby, sweet love. Girl, feel what I feel?)


Last August, I met this hard chick, caught a carbon pick
'bout to visit her, man, in month six
Just comin' home from a two year trip
Now we 'bout to do two cause her man turned snitch
She under pressure, want me to come rescue her
But Inspectah is no haven for the rester
I feel you breakin' out but it's the path you chose
Fuckin' your foes will have sons breakin' your nose
Seen her once or twice now as weeks went by
Slidin by tryin' to hide the black eyes
Lookin' right though, I might go for her seduction
Dangerous curves, I must avoid bein' sucked in
Lustin', I caught her at the function
Slid out the side, saw the ride and jumped in
Later on, the fox unlatched the black box
Got her rocks then collapsed from the backshots


Forget me not (Baby, sweet love.)
Forget me not (Girl, feel what I feel?)
(Baby, sweet love. Girl, feel what I feel?)


(Last night...) changed it all, I had a ball
First of all, I got an obscene phonecall
All I heard was heavy breathin', laugh sounds and moans
An intimate kiss followed by the dial tone
Repeatedly, this person kept callin' my home
Givin' graphic details of her sexual jones
No clue of who, must've been a total stranger
Annoyin' me, yeah, but talkin' me out my anger
State your name and stop playin' games
If you wanna spark flames, it can be arranged
On your side of town, right around now
What you workin' with, let me know how it's goin' down
Then the phone clicked, then once again, it rang
With directions to the lab, where she's doin' her thang
To my surprise, when I arrived, she had her legs cocked
I got her red hot and blessed the wet spot

 (*til fade*)
Forget me not (Baby, sweet love.)
Forget me not (Girl, feel what I feel?)
(Baby, sweet love. Girl, feel what I feel?)


Yeah, BBC status
Mockin' birds like Zorro
Give me a phonecall tomorrow






Yo, (Wu) one two (Tang) one two (Wu-Tang)
It's the Wu (Wu-Tang) creepin in the shadows (Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
Sir I, Excalibur  (Wu-Tang...)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
Yeah

My rap style swing like Willie Mays
My eyes Purple Haze, my solar razor burn through shades
Rhyme grenades raid the airwaves, catch this rap page
I glide like, hovercrafts on the Everglades
Born master, with the faster blade, track slasher
Manufacture poems to microphones, bones fracture
Limited edition composition spark friction
Non-fiction, the calm bomb, keep your arms distance
Zero tolerance, dominant intelligence
Wu original, true colors step from the melanin
The most high, most try, to get close by
And overthrow I, but choke, with they hopes up high
I circulate the tri-state and vibrate beyond the Richter
Fly sistas flock when they spot this live nigga
The crowd seducer black your third eye before I lose ya
Verbal high, leave styes in the eyes of Medusa
Top ten, poly like Cochran, and Sharpton
Narrow margin, of your odds to dodge the marksman
Murder rap, kill you soft like Roberta Flack
Words attack like a British Bulldog, observe the stacks

(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)

(Oh baby, for heavens sake)

(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)


Now all pay tribute to this entity
A spark that surges through the undergrowth
Overwhelming the populace from the entry
The Wu-Tang Dynasty, has emerged
From this elite fleet I was appointed to strike the vital nerve
Mouths tend to utter and speak empty words
Observe the magnetic attraction as we breathe
Seeds of MC's at these fake ass industry niggas
Feed off, the chrome mic tend to squeeze off
And spray, an array of shots
That travel downwind, just respect my prolific pen
As I send, the minds of the weak
To rise and take power I blew tower-ing over the land
As we stand, expanding our cream
A dollar to every grain of sand
Let the mind use the physical as planned

(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)



Yo, yo, this is Beirut
Try to comprehend check out my new suit
Gods blend aim take fire pure destruction
Disappear from here, my year, drop the stupid LP's everywhere
Fallin out the sky tall sniper
Raps by Cappadonna hit the countryside
Poetry whirlpool, RZA and True collide
We produce article exception to the rule
We the black men that struck oil, the hardboiled
Cats that made that Watergate thing go spoiled
The heavy-handed, locked down stranded with Cyrus
Wu Pirates, sneak inside the club, low eyes
Low down dirty, twelve thirty, night time crawlers
Off-the-wallers, basketball gun brawlers
Smoked out throw both fists for nine-seven
Slang reverend, put the best work in

(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)

(Oh baby, for heavens sake)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
(Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
Yo
(Oh baby, for heavens sake)




Yo, uh huh
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang


You think I'm kinda crazy, but I gotta few regrets
Livin like a king, with a pocket full of grits
We come from different worlds, don't you ever forget
I'm just a poor little white boy, showin my respect


Like Willie Mays
My eyes Purple Haze, my solar razor burn through shades
My grenades raid the airwaves, catch this rap page
I glide like, hovercrafts on the Everglades
Boom master, with the faster blade, track slasher
Manufacture poems to microphones, bones fracture
Limited edition composition spark friction
Non-fiction, the calm bomb keep your arm distant
Zero tolerance, dominant intelligence
Wu original, true colors step from the melanin
The most high, most try, to get close by
And overthrow I, but choke, with they hopes up high
I circulate the tri-state and vibrate beyond the Richter
Flies sense to flock when they spot this live nigga
The crowd seducer black your third eye before I lose ya
Verbal high I leave stars in the eyes of Medusa
Top ten, parley like Cochran, it's often
Narrow margin, of your odds to dodge the marksman
Murder rap, kill you soft like Roberta Flack
Words attack like a british bulldog, observe the stacks




Now all pay tribute to this entity
A spark that surges through the undergrowth
Overwhelmin the populace from the entry
The Wu-Tang Dynasty, has emerged
From this elite fleet
I was appointed to strike the vital nerve
Mouths tend to utter and speak empty words
Observe the magnetic attraction as we breathe
Seeds of MC's at these fake ass industry niggas
Feed off, the chrome mic tend to squeeze off and spray
An array of shots that travel downwind
Just respect pyrhiffic pen
As I send, the minds of the weak
To rise and take power I blew tower-ing over the land
As we stand, expanding our CREAM
A dollar to every grain of sand
Let the mind use the physical as planned




Beirut
Try to comprehend check out my new suit
Gods blend aim take fire pure destruction
Dissapear from here, my year, drop the stupid LP's everywhere
Fallin out the sky tall sniper
Raps by Cappadonna hit the countryside
Poetry whirlpool, RZA and True collide
We produce article exception to the rule
We the black men that struck oil, the hardboiled

"Oh, baby" "Oh, baby"

Wu, yo
"Oh, baby"




I'm your highness, your highest title, numero uno
Putos, they clone  like Naruto
Your man super, grand groover on that Sambuca
Mass mover, automatic rap Ruger
Clap back, I bleed for my brother
You know, the wolves stay fed cause they feed on each other
I got a G for a mother
Cynthia's son, take the game like three at the buzzer
Harder than the prison wall, hitting y'all all
Up in critical condition it's official when my clique involved
Listen y'all, Sir I certified
Anything other than the facts are falsified
They idolize I, well i know wise guys, leave em eyes wide
Inside the gravel pit, spitting cyanide
Darts flash, hot enough to warp glass
When the shark pass, piranhas park 


I'm kinda swole, cause everything I want I got made
I never feared, got everything from choppers to blades
They gave me rags and all of them they knew I want haze
When I was spliffing that night, me and the  with K's
Some kids across town thought I was amazed
Knew I was fronting, I had the army in range
It's most of us popping pains, selling drugs in the rain
Trynna make money, maintain and build me a train
Deal with facts only, no slang, that's only for dames
We will run up in the building tags and niggas with chains
Rocking range, lock and aim, take your sneakers and chain
Leave em snubbed, outta luck, you shoulda bought you your flames
But you didn't, this could happen to a king or a queen
Be on point next time and don't be bringing no lames
Cause if you fuck up the next time it might make you famous
Might bump into a gunman who only want brains and shit


I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
I get the cash, see money over tricks and
But keep a snow bunny in the kitchen
The hood still love cause I'm different, see that's the difference
I talk greasy, my hands greasy, that's the chicken
It's that easy, my flow phat cause I'm that greedy
You got to feed me in stacks, what up to Crakk Peedi
State property, racially profiled
State trooper stopping me, I'm low down
Dirty it's a shame, I should slow down
Kick off my shoes, put my coat down
Separate the oil from the coke now
Pennies I got plenty and I still want more
Kinda like a Beamer '35 I still want four
85% still don't know
That is a hundred percent and y'all rappers tryna steal my flow


I got a name from everything from con to Sway
I got my row stitched up by a Colombian name
I got a crack spot, a G5 I never flown
I got a shark, a dog with a solid gold bone
I even copped me a piece of mind up in the Buddhist mountains
I don't sweat money, I got ten accountants
With fly bitches butt naked in Bermuda
And buddha, ice cooler, Grey Goose and big Ruger
The fact is, I pose for low in Gazelle glasses
The booth Ted Dibiase just tripled the carats
And you can tell by the style I choose
I'm creatively superior, I rhyme over the blues
Never lose, never lost,  of the frost
I got a whole clan and Tonetana's the boss
I get paid when my record is played
To put it short: I got it made




I represent myself and my own defense
Innocent by reason of no evidence
Plus they're tryin' pick the punishment the judge insists
My fingerprints were traced back to six gun clips
Cop witness, who try and testify on my click
He on the payroll that's why I got my prior dismissed
This is framework, somehow they got ahold of my flick
The night in question, I was restin' home with my chick
Then the spot was blown, cops rushed in, shots were blown
I jetted out the lab with socks and boxers on
Undercover chased me down for three weeks
He ceased to interrogate like I might speak
But no, I won't tell ya who I work for
And no, I won't tell ya who the work's for
You can hit me with the book, brick, hammer and all
I dig a tunnel or just scale the jailhouse wall
Your honor..


True me ???
Dem a see me push weight and dem claim dem see me, dem try frame me
But me nah snitch, they try and test me me bust my clip
Me on de blunts all de time and de gyal dem a wine
True dem Rebel I and I, we bust down de sign
Try frame me but nah me nah snitch
They try test me me bust my clip


They got me framed, locked and chained
Cuz some lame on the block was slain
Cops came but I ain't pop a flame
Hear me ya honor? I ain't dropped a thing
I was cuffed, they told me that somebody dropped my name
And the time they tryin' to match me with is not the same
I was knocked from 8:00 to the time the shot went rang
When I woke up, I smoked up and watched the game
Then I laid up with my bitch and got rocked with brain
Release me from this Elymer Fudd shit, the glove don't fit
Too tall for the cop description and slugs don't fit
He was hit with a nine right? I bust slugs with a fifth
You got any of my D.N.A. or blood up in this bitch?
I'm not the guy aligned to fall, this not my crime at all
You lock me up, I'm climbin' the wall
You want me scapegoat, so stay close, alliance will call
With some grimy niggas schemin' on the shines in the hall
Fuck that, you and the D.A. spit-shine our balls
You can catch up with me some other time, from mines to yours




Come on a plea bargain for what, your honor?
Nah yo I ain't do shit, the only thing I'm coppin' is a new whip
The night it happened I was lampin' at a deuce flick with two chicks
Kim and Chris, we guzzle Cris' on some Rush Hour 2 shit
I knew the kid, yeah we had problems, yeah I robbed him
Now it's '98 though and the handgun was a revolver
You tryin' to play me on an old case but I hold no weight
Turned myself in, I skated on them keystone jakes
Right description, right Killa, wrong case, I didn't hit him
Here's the verdict, not guilty, not tryin' to see a prison
Got my life on the line, you wanna grind me through ya system
And have my family and my wiz cryin', I miss 'em
You buggin', you the same judge that framed K with the drugs
Somebody came up dead and now you wanna blame us?
This shit is too much, aiyo before you screw us
I'll grab the bailiff's gun and light this whole room up 




Is you ready?
Back by popular demand...
Murderous specialist tactics
Wu-Tang Clan, no rehearsal or practice
Niggas ain't ready for this...
Niggas ain't ready for this...
Niggas ain't ready for this...


Chrome dips beaming off July sun rays
Caesar fade, blending with the side burn shades
Cotton club status, clientele, SL, heavy jewel
Niggas jail, young niggas screw well
Swinging like Smokey on the slow beat
Johnny walker hold me, closely as I mosey on the low key
If you don't know by now, you'll never know me
You know me, I swing it to the young-ins and the OG's
Witnessed by notary public, certified rough shit
Does it feel good, how was it? Gritty like the subway tracks
My protocol permanent like graffiti on the project walls
On the AWOL, alias Jamal Duval
Roam through the universe, plans of owning it all
In the meantime, in between time, we shine
Dangerous minds travel on this uphill climb


If you want some, get some
This is it, son, this one
Make 'em feel the friction
Guaranteed hit, son, miss none
Flip one, you better bring your big gun


Some niggas I'd rather not spar minds with
They can't stimulate my thoughts or fuck with
Creative testosterone, mic-phone
Calms the menopausable hormone quakage
Trapped like estrogen, we making
All of the above, supremely I hold my shit, when I run
I hesitate to stomp the come
Bring water from the brain, nigga
They tried to send me back, but still I came
Terraform mind frame contains
Elements of iron which began steel, healing men life
Allah Just brought me forth to bust mine
This time I spare no one
Poison sword seed technique, breathe the Earth
Take the head of those and feed 'em to the universe
Blessed with volts of electric, life threatning segments, it's hectic


If you want some, get some
This is it, son, this one
Make 'em feel the friction
Guaranteed hit, son, miss none
Flip one, you better bring your big gun


Poetry in motion, east to west coasting
Overseas blowing with lines tightly woven
Still going full speed, pulling g's
Trying to eat 'til my mouth gets too full to feed
I excel, cast spells similar to Merlin
Mic surgeon, hang like Dr. J. Erving
Splurge inner city like uncensored version
Merging with the fast lane, stained with the urban
Word in the street, his work was dirt cheap
Synthetically weak, make the fans start beef
Any comeback attempts would only be in repeats
They soon fall off, be mentally lost beyond reach
My technique's heat leaves a permanent crease
Plant my 2 feet, shooting with the quick release
Never cease fire from a Street called Desire
The sire, disturbing the peace with c-ciphers


Who dare comes amongst and tries to peep it
The secret of the deadly art, then leak it
Snakes, leeches surround the righteous
I lick a diversion shot
Then slip with the swiftness to weave a raindrop
Leaving the eye confused understanding blurred
Cloudy electrical storms occur
From the Masta, classical head bang slang
The deaf tone rises like the blind and dumb
Licking shots at the microphone, Iron Lung
We the first to set off shit, last to run
Who want some, come and get some, motherfucker!


If you want some, get some
This is it, son, this one
Make 'em feel the friction
Guaranteed hit, son, miss none
Flip one, you better bring your big gun




Yo! Get away from the door
Everybody get the fuck back
Staten Island, stand up


I live a street life, nothin' but hard times and strife
I be stuck on the block try'nna make things right
Sold crack for a living, now I could write
Not just for the paper, for the sacrifice
Vibe with me, the cops come ride with me
I'm all in the hood, yeah nigga, slide with me
If the feds start lookin' for Don, survive with me
Experience my ill pain, the broke windows in the rain
Crackheads goin' insane
Marlo stuck dope in his vein, lift him up
Bodies in the back of the hood, stiffen up
It get ugly and shit, why it gotta be this?
We came a long way, fuck cheaters
We don't wanna bust the Heaterz
No speakin' on the phone, we don't trust receivers (yeah)
Park Hill be the real niggas and Don' Divas (it ain't over, it just begun)


Enough of your bullshit, my niggas'll pull quick
Berettas and full quicks, guerillas and convicts
Armed and dangerous, bombs and bangers, kid
Stormin' the game with it, calm but anxious and
I'll whip yo ass for this, come with the cash or it's
On with the blast and it's, gonna get hazardous
Niggas should know by now, niggas should know my style
Shaolin, hold me down, frontin', there goes the pow!


Why it gotta be like this
Police fightin' us with night sticks, niggas carryin' ice picks
Sometimes, niggas we do crimes, I ain't gotta tell you
Niggas throwin' up signs, niggas shipped to Bellview
Son, don't let coke dog smell you
Run if you packin' something, do what I tell you
Skate, nigga, never let jake nail you
I got caught up in the grind but I fell through
Now I'm back on the spot, keep my eye on you
Make a phone call, kid, or put a spy on you..
And this is dedicated to all my niggas in the ghetto
Big dimes and C Rule, jugs of Palmetto
I'm in too deep and I just can't let go
Catchin' my pain, real niggas that respect dough




It's my world!
Fucked up... stick 'em! Ugh..
2-4, Graveyard Shift
(The names and the faces have changed
But the game, is still the same...)




Get your girl, get your glass, get body, body
Grab your man, it's your jam, get body, body
Get body, body, get raunchy, raunchy
When I say, get body, just party, party


Toss shots like a shotty vay, hot over poppy doc
Hot offa bottle top, ma, I make your bottom drop
I can make the top rise, rise keep it king size
Packing cuz the heat rise, jacket and the jeans fly
Louis with the 1-3, son G, stun thee
Crack another Stoly, I can hold me, I'm my own G
I'm just trying to get my party party
Niggas hating, niggas watching like paparazzi
He try something stupid, get body body
Cuz that mob with me probably get raunchy raunchy
So, DJ play that song again, back to the floor again
Four in the morning and the doors still pouring in
Shorty with the forty inch, star struck, adoring him
Love it for the night, love, you never have all of him
Things be calling him, dope man, cross your ten
Fitted with the flaps, black and grey, three quarter Timbs
Everything they offer him, on the house, balling out
Walking out, with that redbone in the halter blouse




Loose off the Goose and juice, louder, give the tune a boost
Ladies do the hula hoop, fellas show 'em who's the truth
Bounce, take it through the roof, jumping out your zoot suit
Ice cream flavors, misbehaving, I'mma scoop a few
Grown man, turn 'em out, fuck, what you heard about
Lean back, work it out, haters be the first to doubt
I'm just trying to get my party party
You can spot me at the bar with that Dark Bacardi
Yeah, ain't nobody gotta bodyguard me
My dudes got me if I leave the party wildly, now
Move if you feeling G, lean like you steer the V
Blaze it up, where's the P? Right here's where it be
Talk to me, what's the deal, fuck with me, cuz it's real
Let me get something clear, ya'll with me, up in here
Show me what you got then, homey, what you popping
Mami, getting body, just show me why you hopped in
DJ bring that record back, whole crowd sweating that
Throw it on, bet it crack, get involved, get your mack






Aiyo, what the fuck is this shit
That ya'll are listening to nowadays on the radio, man?

(Yeah... do not attempt to adjust your radio
Your system is now under the control of House Gang FM
Featuring your host for the night
The leader of the The Rebellion, the Rebel INS
Yeah, yeah, yeah)


Ain't no doubt big homey is sick, heads know me to flip
Before it goes down, show me the chip
It's going down, La, throw me the fifth
Hold it so quick, get ya word out to Donnie and Fisk
It's the sicker guy, he be hogging the rock
And don't split the pie, big bomb in his sock
Now watch him dip the five, plus he spit sick jive
Rest in peace to that million dollar kid with the Why
On a city high, wide tires and rims
Rocking custom made suade suits and mobster brims
On fedoras, start with three quarters, before rap
You saw us handcuffed, jumping out the Ford Taurus
Spitting like a calico, soprano or alto
No doubt, though, I gets down to my outro
That's how it go, in the club or the hood
We the wolves in this rap, like off to no, good, man


Ya'll don't wanna fuck with me
The Rebel INS, W-T-C
The crew H-D from the U-D-Z
You wanna get down, get down with me


Aiyo, Streetlife, what up, nigga? (yeah)
Size/7 (hit me up), Johnny Blaze (Wu-Tang)
The RZA (Golden Arms), The GZA, all my fam roll deep
(ODB rest in peace, baby!)


They wanna get with the kid, I give 'em the biz
That's what this is, splitting ya wig, living it big
Ain't try'nna see prison or bids, I'm got to get this
I'm in your crib, son, I did it to live
Been sick since the crib, now I'm this big, flip wigs
The main reason money lost his wiz
Put some money on the wood, I need atleast six figs
For some money in the hood, watch the hoods get biz
It's the good shit, kid, not the twenty or gram
Them fishscale, tip the scale, kill a gram
I'm choppin' on the plate, bag it up, like weight
Had you fiending like Dave Chappelle in Half Baked
The last of the great, I crash and cause quakes
Got the cash it takes, I might flash my face
Slash breaks with the fader, watch 'em fascinate
Straight, pull off a caper, snatch cake and break, nigga




Get money, get fly, get busy, get live
Get over, get by, get women, get high
Get right!


Think you can stop us, really? Ya'll niggas got to feel me
Peel out Suzuki's, make those Kawasaki's pop a wheelie
Cuz only I could hold me, V.S.O.P. control me
Better watch those rollies, yo, we crash spots, warn the police
You think you know me, cool as Coolie High, co-chief
Roamin' the streets, black like no justice and no peace
Keepin' the pace, not gon' lose my place, in this paper chase
Smell this pie we bake, make your plate, take a taste
Make no mistakes, though, some toes gettin' stepped on
My name is tephlon, hook 'em like it's methadone
Whenever the record's on, set the bomb, test my arm
I'm never alarmed, the best are harmed when the pressure's on
Back on the block, pull up on the spot, drunk's pop
Once a drop, echoin' through ghettoes like gun shots
Pull out that twenty spot, what we got's above hot
Killa Beez, we run shop, runnin' from the top, it goes




Listen, baby, work your dance, to this verse I chant
Victim of my circumstance, get at me, first chance
Bet it's a short deal, good, how ya'll feel
Ditech, it's all wheel, gonna make 'em all kneel
Givin' the play, million shipped today, who got shit to say?
Poured it in Broadway, check me out in the big display
That's overlookin', Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn
Staten, Manhattan, wherever there's a hood in
I dig my foot in, men of honor like I'm Cuba Gooding
You was bookin' when they jumped off, but who was lookin'
Via satellite, I broadcast the fast light
That's right, pass the mic, load me up, I'll crash it tight
When in the zone, I lose it, I'll put them blown in fuses
There's no explainin', no escapin' and no excuses
Move if you true, the kid is due, let my niggas through
Gettin' physical and the streets continue to




Yeah, yeah
Ya'll, and that's right ya'll
And we goin' no where, it's all night ya'll
I love my ladies with jeans that fit tight ya'll
For all my fellas on bikes with chrome pipes, ya'll
Ya'll from the north, west, south to the east side
We really don't mind, we rep each side
Haters get mad, they left outside
You feel what I feel, then come inside


The eyes like David Caress, so check my following
Move with The Movement, that's your only option
My coalition, all in position on this mission
No quittin', slowly inchin' closer to this vision
Won't you listen, couldn't inflict your system with conviction
Stop your bitchin', hard times is all you're gettin'
See the fire in my eyes, desire in my vibes
Liar in disguise, never measure eye and eye
On any of us, what, bounce, before you get touched
The town's not big enough, give it up, get it shut
Down like Studio 54, you know that this be raw, you know that this be war
I'm ahead of the game, why lose, it's better to gain, no darts
Are ever the same, Deck's my name, I never changed
On the road to riches, out to foe the snitches
I roll wit chicks who pose for pictures, they rich and hold the figures






You know what it is... H.G., U.D.Z's
S.I.N.Y., 10304, get big
Yeah.. Wu-Tang for life


It's like World War IV in the field, daily ordeal
Wolfpack diggin' claws in your mill
Ducking blue coats tossin' the steel, it's all real
My lifetime of crime, I never talk or squeal
And I move with the coldest around, I be holding my ground
And I'mma hold it til I'm thrown in the ground
So I'm blowing rounds and I'm known to carry six
New Jacks in the City, get "Burned" like "Larry Fish"
Daddy rich, bitch magnet, I hand you a fix
Spit bricks on the mix and make the avenues flip
Cali grips on the regular, beretta's a fifth
Jumping out, nappy whips, watch ya neck & your wrist
No question I'm reppin' my click, specialist
From the young'ns to O.G., checkin' for this
Play hard on the graveyard shift, cigar split
Far quick, when the shit jump off, you heartless
This is S.I.N.Y., Killah Killah Hill
10304, home to gorillas in the field
Yeah, what up all my niggas out there
10304, home to gorillas in the field


Ya'll wanna ride with us, get ya weight up
You want it live & direct, get the pay up
From the projects, blocks, we on our way up
Animal Ways of Life, you get ate up
To all my ballers & broad, y'all stay up
Try'nna make a mil' a day before I lay up
Hot like the pot you got, you cook yay' up
I'm with the foulest in town, so play straight up


I hold it with the bolo grip, solo controller strip
Behold, P.L.O. the click, man, it's over with
So quick, notice how we bang with the knuckles bare
House Gang, keep it fresh lik supper ware
The Jungle, Animal House, gat in your mouth
Gamble with the wild life, cannibal out
Give this full course meal in effect, reel to reel or cassette
Or with the mask on peelin' the tech
Killah Hill, man, you feelin' my set, feelin' my rep
Annamette with the top down, wheelin' the 'Vette
Scoop me downtown, cop the bread and back to the 'victs
Twist a blunt in front of Jake and still mash on the strip
Face swift with the rap shit, stacking them chips
In the pits, stick shit, cats packing them grips
Bad bitch with the black six after my dips
She like, this your pussy, and she splash my click
See my name on the wall, not a fake or a fraud
Niggas straight, like an inmate, try'nna make the board
Make way and dues pay for sure, I lay law, stay raw
Cause a 'massacre' with no 'chainsaw'
Have y'all talk about it, but you don't want war
See my wolves eat the bones and they still want more
We be foaming at the mouth, even, I doubt we leave without eating
So without reason, pounds are squeezing
The lifestyle of fiends and beans, big dreams and CREAM
Bitches ride like the Scream Machine
Caught a taste of it, the chick strip, clean out the jeans
Next thing she was smuggling coke between the scene






I'm a victim of the very song I sing
These mean streets of N.Y.C
Got a hold of me, just when I thought I was out
They pull me back in... Aiyo..


I've been, thrown in the bullpens over again
And I've been, sent up a river not built to swim
I had, diamonds and furs all at a young age
And I had, fame and fortune, name on the front page
I got, shot at and sliced twice over some dice
And I got, set up by broads one night while gettin' nice
I've seen, the livest thug cat die over drugs
And I've seen, the little nigga that fire the slugs
The hood, gave me free lunch, dumps and Johnny pumps
The hood, gave me free base, gates and shotty pumps
They found, Sonya son, face down in the trash
And they found, the loaded gun and eight rounds in the grass
It's real, some images'll make your wide eyes closed
It's real, I don't regret it, it's the life I chose
I made, money and love, move bundles in loads
And I made, plenty of foes, that's the way it goes


When you livin' in the G-H-E-T-T-O
Daily the gun shuts blow
Since we chose this life, I suppose
That's just the way it goes
Livin' in the G-H-E-T-T-O
Daily the gun shuts blow
Since we chose this life, I suppose
That's just the way it goes


I feel, that it's a set back, death in a trap
And I feel, the foul presence, so a weapon is strapped
You live? You be talking the town for short time
You live? They be hawkin' you down with long knives
And still, these are the good times, I wouldn't contest
But still, I don't believe this is good as it gets
We tried, to beat the game, playin' possum, we die
And we tried, to ease the pain, stayin' constantly high
It's like, you gotta fight for your life to break bread
It's like, there's more cops on the block then baseheads
That's why, I drop a jewel, spit rude on tape
And that's why, it's possible to keep food on the plate
I strive, to persevere, though my dunns ain't here
And I strive, surprised I made it thirty somewhat years
For now, I get the Presidents, ya hustle low-key
For life, I represent the H-Double O-D





* iTunes bonus track


Come out your clothes, legs in the air
Give it to me raw, bout face in the chair
Looking so good, I swear
I might not make it to the room, I'mma take it right here
Can't focus, hand on your tits
Backyard clap, handcuffs on your wrist
Nothing that can handle the diss
Girl, you take it like a pro, with your hands on your lips
Butt out your weave when I please ya
We gon' bring down the house like Steve & Latifah
Act like you want it honey
Just one stroke from the rod, you be walking funny
And you don't really want to love me
Tap that ass so right, that you offer money
Take it like a champ, it's more than lovely
Take 'em to the bed when it's call me lovely


She like that ghetto love, hardcore, hair pull from the back
(That rated X love, keep it up, while I ride your lap)
I make you sweat, love (dont stop) how you like it that
Give it to me, girl, don't make a scene (give it to me, boy, I make you scream)


Uh, ride rough, whips and the handcuffs, you don't really want H to
Tell you what
In a birthday suit, all amped up, seen me, now smile for the cameras
Say cheese on your knees, don't you know a woman I need
This world we live in now, suck it up
Want a world watch, player tear it up
Scared of what I added up, chick from nine to ten
Better than the sex, is who gon' win, we at it again, yeah
From the bed to the floor, til the camera touch
Show me what you got, now you on top
Go deep like I just got shot
Bout to turn in my mouth, boy
Work-work-work that bad bone and let it all out cuz mami ain't home
Who's that bitch calling your phone, I'm grown, I'll slice a chick
Matter fact, who's pipe is it, it's tight as shit
Sexy chick, you found the right now, got two holes, you got to like one




Grind on my lap, spinap tap
Baby gon' wind it behind it that
Squat like Tae Bo, side to back
Bring it to the front, now ride it back
Never mind the sack, get inside the track
From the bed to the floor I'mma ride the cat
Throw it back like you don't know how to act
Wanna hit from the side til it's time to nap


Uh, last night I had a ball, should of been on the alcohol
Have you ever had a chick this tall, made 'em beg for he dropped his drawers
Sucked so much it gave him lockjaw, me play shit, he play straw
Take away like a U Haul, yeah, cause shots like a pool hall, rack 'em up
Uh, why you acting up, hit your breaks, I'm backing up
Make shit cut, cut the malt liquor, off the page of all I'm made
To the miles house thugs get made, can't play a chick like an arcade
They said, keep the news on the mission
Hot box, and got it detention








Yo, Inspectah Deck track
Break your back Yo

A message of a wreckage
50 shell hot track leaking out the Lexus
Eyes hot, Cyclops, cyborg boulders
Call shop of horrors, Lyric just smoking in my holster
Whip and boil, ?lugotan? hurricane the holler
Daily operation, bullet train tingle farther
8 seconds a scar your style wild buccaneer
Round table revolve around ten musketeer
Thank you, got all the riches
Think you poli with bitches
You could run the fuck opponent, gotten with the glitches
The swiftness, hit the spots that are vital
Shake the ground decent, like 3 sticks of dyno


My administration deceive the population
Start the next generation by artificial insemination
Contaminate stations, for music in the making
Concentration camps, Assassinate for industry domination
Abomination, The Competition and confrontation you mistaken
I'm a nuclear warhead bomb evasion
Extermination of the next man, when the Germans blazing
We burn this for occasions, regardless I see your expiration
Preparation your sweatin
I cassette deck and eject your selection for air time
Blow a hole through your brain so you can think with a clear mind
A redesign? of hard rhyme, and slang cracking in spare time


Crime Time
We rollin with the undisputed, routin toutin
21 gun solutin, new recruiting
Wu-Tang, slang bang your unit
Put us in your cassette deck, yo, improvement
Smash and blast the shit, I'm doper than math
That makes you level through the devil
And never surpass
The stakes is hot, like bullet snatch pots
And hot twats
Fully operational gats mmhmm
The uncanny, vilagialaty panty man
Crock, took by the hook of the candy man
Look, now you caught up in the suction
Rap Tight and my appetite destruction


Today's day, The bomb gets dropped on America
Human civilization in concert treble concentration camps
Replacement amps blown, Speaker abduction
The Mad weed seduction corruption
From The brain cells decreasing
Its sucker duck season. fuck treason
Blast as you trespass, bullet enters your mouth and exits your ass
Impregnate the math, then give birth to a newborn
Figure of speech drew form, with 8 arms
Napalms, collapses stages you perform on dominate
Drama face, abominate, sling crack behind the black high gate
The nine fades the hearts of men
Slip the cartridge in
Off the hook like telemarketing sales condone over the phone


Danger zone
Bozzy Capone alone, in a terradome Stalon
With a great cannon, bones cerebral swollen
Straight both ways scanning
All you roaches lay down I spray the brain damage
Bring the banners, the green gamma ray
Gain up the same data, Scatter
Then a dark part where D and you used to play all day
The ray sound stung you, You kung fu check the cleaner
From fire line I gun you for fun
Dial 9-1-1
Someone tore down the tunnel son
1-2 Check your fronts
Captain Crunch, munch on you for lunch
You punchbag drunk, bald headed monk
Top bunk, chunk your trunk full of junk
Buffer and bump stop humping me
Ruff a scum sucking muthafuckas
Ducking my shit just luckily


Other emcees made a big mistake
Fronting on the mic that's truly great
What? how you want it fried or baked
I place in right through the heart of a snake
Sceam at mapps, take what we can take
Til the day we die, meet the pearly gates
Golden Arms going strong, I'm holding weight
Cause
(Repeat)




Yeah, know what I'm saying?
Wise Intelligent, broadcasting live from the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro
Know what I'm saying?
Hip hop go wherever I go
For real, Poor Righteous Teachers represent
'96 off the hook we're dropping this hit kid
Watch


Lord, how you be, madam G, peace God
Fuck frauds, get yours, kick ass, leave scars
On Mars I built a school to study life on Earth
Thoughts burst, a million rappers murdered in the first verse
Now what's worse than eating dirt, being buried alive
Put to death by surprise in the name of black gods
Ain't I most fly? Young pie don't cry
Dry the tears from your eye and your lover might live
Life to give, life to take, never making mistakes
All wise enjoying everything right and exact
Poor facts, pro-black, Donnelly Homes projects
Learn that time is the same on Casio or Rolex
Knowledge James, chapter two, verse one through six
But try not to judge a man by the price of his kicks
Come off this talk shit  convert words to actions
Cause you know Jersey runs things every time boy
Build destroy, Trenton must make noise
Enjoy the fruits of life, need the wife and my boys
My seed won't need for anything, trust me
Black man, 'nuff land, eight hundred acres of trees
Please the seven seas travel regularly
Degrees consciously study everywhere we be
Family daring he who talks enough shit
And come and get the stitch to fix the split upper lip
The shit providers
Will call us great civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers black


Whatever happened to the Gods and the Earths
They thirst for a pot of gold God's worth is birth
Knowledge is worth more than diamonds
When the mind is shining, surprise us
Gods Earths and 85ers


Dedicated to the Gods and the Earths
Dip dip dive-a, civilize an 85er


Intelligent, twenty-three, now nineteen five
Hold the mic I'll rise right in front of your eyes
In here six years see what I felt every year
Oh yeah it's ninety-six I'm born and understanding, understood
Get the goods, build a school down south
In some remote location that nobody knows about
Teach, add on to the life that we live
God degree, twelve jewels, eat the foot that I give
No pig, strictly kosher mathematics and fact
Poor blacks on track mission to take the Earth back
Cause Whitey got it locked, that's why the whole world's lost
We wearing crowns made of thorns and being put to the cross
Lost souls futures told in the Dead Sea Scrolls
God reduced to a savage lacking soul control
Talking lots of shit about his drugs and guns
Several daughters, 'nuff sons, ain't trying to raise none, yo
Whoa-ho-ho, let me slow up with the flow
Can't move too quick because niggas got to know
The duty of the civilized is to civilize the uncivilized
And make the world recognize
That God is Wise, and Wise is God to the death
And back to life, you Lazarus and I'm the Christ
The forthcoming, like a thief in the night
The wave of light, the key to everlasting life
That shit provide us, to call us straight civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers y'all


Whatever happened to the Gods and the Earths
They thirst for a pot of gold God worth his birth
Knowledge is worth more than diamonds
When the mind is shining, surprise us
Gods Earths and 85ers

 (x2)
Dedicated to the Gods and the Earths
Dip dip dive-a, civilize an 85er


Since I've been away I've been thinking about
How gunslingers turned singers and black culture went out
Wake up all you teachers tired of teaching and wait
Grass roots, pass truth into the ears of black youths
Watch me talk the talk and walk the walk right now
As mystic as it seems, I bring for real to your dream seeing
Midnight marauder got it dipped off the block drug
Street niggas bug cause they know we do it for the love
We rose above every limit that they said we had
Who loves your ass enough to strictly educate the mass?
Come get your cash, fill your mind with swine and dash
For longevity, these niggas we will never be
You will remember we from now till forever G
I am infinity, lyrics flowing endlessly
You ain't no friend to me so don't even pretend to be
Like O.J. Simpson be sleeping with the enemy
I call you out and make the world know your ass is lacking
Quoting some lessons but see no parts of understanding
You standing under my rain, snow, sleet, hail and thunder
That's why you wonder what's causing this to exist
I raise the mist, distill the myths of many currents
Don't be determined except to life forget the death
Nevertheless you're being blessed cause I'm who God is
Don't know the time niggas must be wearing Guess watches
Hands on your boxes, turn 'em up like seven notches
Your Magnavoxes amplify my super conscious
Shit providers, we'll call us straight civilizers
And true suppliers for Gods, Earths, and 85ers y'all


Hold it down kid and you don't stop
P.R.T. represent shop
(There's a new set of rules you shall all have to abide by
And the non-lyrical shall be terminated)




I can't yell right now, cause I'll get fired, and my boss ll' hear me, and then I won't be able to pay off my student loans, but you know what? You're an asshole. I fucking hate you. I bought all your records, this whole fucking time I've been trying to get you to come hang out with me. I'm gonna have people fuck with your food the rest of your trip! You fucking dick!

I like him. That's quite moving


To my niggas im considered the best
To those niggas im considered a threat
Cause i dont give it a rest
It's in my nature like Vinny and Treach
That i bless em with the what?
Fuck the world that's that Biggie and Mef
King swing like a master, Bubba Watson
Move with the true nigga, no other option
I see green, like im teeing off golfing
And that's a fact
These cats whack
Call 'em Sharpton
Deck is a colt
Believe how i spit it
The end result is your brain leaking out your fitted
I'm a beast with it
Simply said blink you dead
Since lifes' a bitch my mind always think ahead
Since life's a bitch my mind always think of bread
Got my numbers up
Even the odd's and beat the spread
So king me the crown i need up on my head
Sour by the pound now i'm out to see the dreads


I'm gone!
I say i'm more than sick, and no pillar get me off my shit
(dig it!)i'm gone
Point of no return i m out there with an o to burn, you learn
Im gone
I said im lovin' the hate ,supergrind like i hustle with a cape, wait
Im gone
Not a shadow behind, to see me you got to travel in time
My mind is gone!


Cooley High brother slide
Keep my fam stoned
Stay fuckin' up your head like some bad dome
Deck deal it
Bet you feel it in your backbone
Shorty strip for a king no stacks thrown
Underdog, but my game straight cash rule
Punish y'all like my name is Frank Castle
Toss a broad to my G that's a lateral
The five-0 always on my back like the admiral
Poppin' on the avenue
Bangin' in ya man's crib
The whole world behind my words like an adlib
You average!
I get's dirty like the bastard
Im eight-thirty
Angry birdy's on the man's dick
Who am i? Im the mic Max Julien
The superfly Truck Turner plus the Wu and 'em
Suicide bomber time's up no defusin'g him
Dude's touch a problem they dont know what do with 'em


I'm gone!
I say i'm more than sick, and no pillar get me off my shit
(dig it) i'm gone
Point of no return i m out there with an o to burn, you learn
I'm gone
I said im lovin' the hate , supergrind like i hustle with a cape, wait, I'm gone
Not a shadow behind, to see me you got to travel in time
My mind is gone!




Yeah, yeah, one-two, one-two, Czarface
Ayo Deck, you ready?


You already know man...
My new name Czarfonzerelli, when you see me...
You just call me 'Czarfonzerelli'


Yeah, let's go


Test me, I run upside your head like Jet Li
So raw, so pure call it fresh squeeze
On the town more than Rex Reeve
Deck he's something like the FDA
How I check cheese
I reach quota, black ops elite soldier
Move undercover through NY, Malik Yoba
G coder, beast moder, never cease motor
Machine gun rap clap until the beats over
Czarfonzerelli so cool
He toss a quarter in the juke-box from across the room
And what I spit upon tome, takes over your mind
The rhyme is like Victor Von Doom
From the womb to the tomb
The boom bap ritual
Not the typical, bullshit that you listen to
Its principle, hip hop that's what you call this
For more bars than Mardi Gras and all this


My past is darker than the blackest magic marker in the
Hands of Clive Barker when he's crafting Books of Blood
And I attack it harder, I'm Pat Tanaka
My sparring partner's half of Sparta, my sack is larger
I crack apart an MC like an Iron Man toy with plastic armor
I'm the rap Chewbacca
Get my point across like Hawkeye, the Archer
You ain't runnin shit like half-court games
You out for more fame, that makes me say "Y" like the J in Bjrk's name
Look at you and look at me
You look like a shook emcee
Only time you load the clips is when you put in Pusha T
Kill 'em, drill 'em, grill 'em I'm a villain I'm like Leatherface
You'll never save the lesser race of invaders from space
Come and devastate my Rebel base
But I will sink them in the ocean
With one motion of my hand, and track you down, like a Stan
Smack you down, that's the plan
Beat you till your brains hollow like a moving van
I'm superhuman and I'll prove it again and again
Swinging limbs like it's sink or swim
These rappers set the bar low like Peter Dinklage at the gym
I'm Michelangelo, I'm mutagen, hooligan
You're a terrapin, a shell of yourself, you brag about the metal
In your hands, that's a kettlebell for your health
I'm bout to buckle down, like I pull a belt from the shelf
Ayo, bring that, and we can do a one-on-one even
And let the chips fall where they may like my son eating


Moe Dee black frames, 80s era crack pains
I smack veins, I snatch chains, I lack brains
Hijack planes, under siege like you riding Casey Ryback trains
My rap reigns like G Rap, Kane's
Mind manipulated, brain dead spoon fed public
Might as well rip off your head and put your brain in your stomach
Genghis Khan modern mongol on your block conquering
Get every suburban hot soccer mom cock gobbling
I'm the white living in the cave Protestant, I'm not to win
The opposite of white wooly hair and bronze copper skin
With just one rhyme, I entertain the deaf, dumb, blind
I'm clever with my words like a Lord Finesse punchline
Fight quick, bloody butcher knife and an ice pick
Put a cop's testicles in a vice grip
And sodomize him with his nightstick
Strike quick, beat a white chick with my white dick
Gash her up like the whip that they beat Christ with
No enlightening, stay partisan
Fighting with the gays targeting
Frightening what the brains harboring
Bright with the days darkening
Wings up, Heaven Razah, I'm a thug angel
I've been unstable since banging beats on a lunch table
Rock Adidas or fedora dookie Rev Run cable
I'm louder than Wu-Tang, Mobb Deep and Big Pun label
Czar




You find an MC like me, who's strong
Leavin' motherfuckers aborted, with no verbal support
When I command the microphone
I get deadly as Khan, though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm all those
Who can withstand the more power I gain?
And make it possible, for me
To drop a few to wreck yo' brain
Imagine and keep on wishin' upon a star
Finally realizin' who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin', faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all-time?
When I created rhyme
For the simple fact, when I attack I crush your pride
Our intention to ride, every time, all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced what I'ma ride
Breakin' in gas with the '68 all day
In-and-out with my pay, I'm soon to count the bodies


So mandatory my elevation, my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with the nigga you facin'
We must be patient, nothin' better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable, like gas stations
Sorry, I left that ass waitin', no more procrastination
Give up to fate and get that ass shakin'
I'm bustin' and makin' motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted
Put that ass in the dirt, you swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to "Rhythm Nation", but thugged out
Forgive me, Janet
Who's in control? I'm activatin' your souls
You know the way the games get controlled
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin' rhyme I wrote
Takin' off my coat, clearin' my throat


I got my mind made up, come on
Get in, get into
Let it ride, tonight's the night
I got my mind made up, come on
Get in, get into
Let it ride, tonight's the night


Well, I comes through with two packs
Of the bomb prophylactics
For protection, so my fuckin' sack won't collapse
'Cause nowadays, shit's evadin' the X-rays
Sendin' young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder if my terrifyin' tactics of torturin' MCs
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifyin' like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin' poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's the fuckin' Bombay
You got ten steps before instant death, like Bai Mei
My rhymes'll leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly virus spread through your head, like Sand Palm
There's no escape, nah, I ain't blastin'
I use my mental to assassinate assassins for those askin'
Opposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killin'
Why is that? 'Cause smilin' faces deceive
You best believe: to MCs, I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camp's under siege, and I'm Jason Voorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mics
My verbal snipe your vocabs on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall
You already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the Equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To L.A., on the spot where I rock and bust, like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat


Fuck you losers!
While you fake jacks, I makes manoeuvres
Like Hitler stickin' up 
The mister Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this message, don't touch the dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musketblaow!
Melons get swellings
I paint mental pictures, like Magellan
Half of my clan's repeat felons
Niggas best protect they joints for nine-nickel
Man, I stay on point, like icicles
Now, who wanna test Tical, then touch Tical?
All up in your motherfuckin' mouth
Headbanger boogie, catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man rolled too tight, you can't pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and fallin' fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot, like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast


Ayo, lyrical gat spittin' the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this mad underground basement shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm spliffted
Funk Doctor, who?
Spock, bitch, don't get it twisted
I got connects, like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless the dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust 'til every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out 'til your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift
Now, you claim that your gears locked
Whiff this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous, like John the Bomb Analyst
Flip MCs like kis
My degrees freeze consecutively, like EPMD LPs
Lick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake wanna snake
Bust it, I'm the one pushin' the hearse, in the first place
Confidence for you shaky-ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke off this antidote, got you ope
Get roast by my lyrical Billy Dee .45 Colt
(And I'm out for nine-nickel)


I-N-S the Rebel




You find an MC like me who's strong
Leavin motherfuckers aborted, with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I get deadly as Khan though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm on those
Who can withstand, the more power I gain
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
Imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin, faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced with it, I'm a ride
Breakin in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies


So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facing
We must be based on nothin better than communication
Known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waitin
No more procrastination give up to fate, and get that ass shakin
I'm bustin and makin motherfuckers panic
Don't take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
But thugged out, forgive me Janet
Who's in control I'm acvtivatin yo souls
You know, the way the games get controlled
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin rhyme I wrote
Takin off my coat, clearing my throat


I got my mind made up, come on... (come on)
Get in get in too (get on it)
Let it ride (get wit it) tonight's tha night
I got my mind made up, come on...
Get in get in too
Let it ride... tonight's tha night


Well I comes through with two packs
Of the bomb prophalaks for protection
So my fuckin sac won't collapse
Cause nowaday's, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electryfing like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's tha fuckin bom-bay
Ya got dissed, that's before it's ingest like balmay
My rhymes, I leave a mark on ya mind
As the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pine
There's no escape, nah I ain't blastin
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin
Opposed to laughin, raw maniacal villian
Laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
Why is that?  Cuz smilin faces decieve
You best believe, to MC's I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
Ya whole camp's under seige, and I'm Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mikes
My verbal snipe, your vocab on site
I'm out tha cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall

To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat


Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
Like Hitler, stickin up *Jews* wit German *lugers*
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this mess-age don't touch tha dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket -- blaooow!!
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellen
Half of my Clan's three deep felons
Niggas best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel
Man I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical then touch Tical
All up in your motherfuckin mouth
Head banger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man roll too tight, you can pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and fallin fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast


Aiyyo, lyrical gas spittin tha criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this, mad underground basement, shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on ya whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor who? Spock bitch don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless, tha dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from tha rear block
To bust til every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold ya nose and blow out til ya ears pop
Since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
With, this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst
Then proceeds like keys
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's
Lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
I'm the one pushin the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke, off this anecdote got you ope
Get roast, by my lyrics Billy Dee .45 Colt
And I'm out for nine nickel


I set the mic in flames, my name's INS the Rebel
Murder one style, smash piles straight to pebbles
Mental terrorist, specialist at this
Menacing lyricst, leave crews defenseless
Can't design landmines, lick off like nines
To paralyze everything, ears ring like doorknobs
Heads start to turn like police who pass
Hear the blast, my crew bust through like tear gas
Fuck a mask, we laced in place like the marshall
Sparkle, like live but harder than tarvue
Wreck this rhyme, start relentless, roughest
And fuck up the party for you paying motherfuckers
Once I commence for you ladies and gents
I kick rhymes, sharper than barbwire fence
The live and direct, from Killah Hill Project
Staten Island, New York, you can't help but to hawk
Lay it on your dental, that's if you want it hostile
Sounds so underground I write my rhymes on fossil
Dudes like this, force me to get you open
Lyrically wet you open, until you soaking




Yo man, like you see all of them creeps over there man?
And you know they ain't cool cuz you know they gonna want some static


I just might slap ya bitch and strip her clothes
For fun, and pull out guns like Axle Rose
Undermine me, and see your future dissipate
Right in front of yo eyes, ain't no surprise
Cuz I leave you fucked up, laid out, dilated
Pupils, everybody you with, all pupils
Poodles to pit bulls, quiet as cougars
Maneuvers, silent, violent shooters
Get involved in this tangle, try me mane
And I'mma hit you so many times I'll be damed
If your homies don't feel it, yo mama too
I kno about your block and where we bring the drama to
I'm more than set, I'm set and more
And I said it before with the choppers, I'm war
Thug illegal for a ??? to start poppin them thangs
Before you say another word, tryin to talk and explain


Niggas wanna shout my name, best believe we got to bang
Squeeze off, pop them thangs, yes indeed we bout them thangs
I walk my talk, I'm a boss, I leave you out your frame
Haters wanna block my game, don't twist it, it's not no game


Yo, I'm still on top of the game, nd the thrill's still hotter than flame
What I spill cause drama to brains, and I ?still drop bombs on ya lane?
Killa Hill, still honor the name, the drill's still more of the same
More portion to gain, I'm rock bottom, no problem to bang
Beyond locks, son got em in chains
He knock on them chains, he on the block where they're poppin them thangs
Six figure wide ride, broads be flier than dimes
She like the iron, she be right be my side
Reason why she be liver than guys
Niggas plot your demise
Shake your hand, look you right in your eyes
I only fuck with heads I can trust
The usual suspects, the next up, Deck and Kurupt
Get your neck cut messin with us, the weapons'll bust
Your best bet, just step to the cut




Yo, why would I change my persona, nigga, if it helped me to grow?
Helped me to glow, helped me to help you niggas know
Helped me to show you niggas I'm the same OG
From when the Wu came through like (suuuuu) in the streets
When Tha Dogg Pound drops sounds that you couldn't believe
I'm on the grounds, lead spray painting M.O.P
(What now?) We ghetto mosh pit in this bitch
Nigga I don't gang bang, but I'll bang a gang you you mothafuckas
I'm tryin to tell you why I'm legit
Nigga I will bang bang until I break a spring in the mothafucka
I'm with it all day, I get love from Brownsville
From Stapleton to Crenshaw to Long Way
So nigga ya'll play and you'll get tossed around
Cuz I'm focused now and I'm with the bosses now, put your pocus down
And if a faggot bitch get one in his abdomen, you know I'm back around




And they jumped me, you understand?
I didn't see any niggas, they all crawled up on me
You understand? Fuck it, You're ???
Cuz I don't wanna get stabbed in my back or nothin
All niggas get stabbed or shot in my back
But dig this, I want em got, I want em layin out




Yeah, it's like salutation, greeting
Ladies and gents, good evening
I'm the speaker for the evening
Get up out your chair, throw your hands in the air
Have drinks on me, hit it slow, though
Each dose, well potent
Some particle, compound into one article
The headline read, shall I proceed?
Hell yeah, well let the turntable spin
Like the chrome on the G wag' Benz, let's begin


Aiyo, spit that shit, that make niggas wanna lick they Glock
When I grab the microphone, I can't stop
To drop that shit that make you get "ahh"
Down on your face, with your the gun to your --
Ladies in the club, they frontin' like --
My brothers in the club, we try'nna get "ahh"


Look, another smash hit, my niggas from the boulevard
East New York squad, in the yard gettin' ripped
'Least twenty five a clip, a hundred men stomp in ya face
The wolves barkin', careful, you might get trampled
Caught flashin', wrap him in the masking tape
Jimmy Basking, murder was the case when the crowd break fool
Iron Mic Duel held down by the poolside
Along came a spider, spun spools in a cypher
Screamin' on your mic, leads spray from the sawed off pipe
Stenographer type, the ghetto hype slang, flow roll
Like water off the brim when it rain
Iron Maiden, checkmating, no escaping, we takin' it


Aiyo, spit that shit, that make niggas wanna lick they Glock
When I grab the microphone, I can't stop
To drop that shit that make you get "ahh"
Down on your face, with your the gun to your --
Ladies in the club, they frontin' like --
My brothers in the club, we try'nna get "ahh"


So terrifyin', so electrifyin'
Ya'll niggas can't deny, it's so death defyin'
Also, unique, it's so much heat
On the turntable wax, when I speak on the beat
One-two, throw it up, like you came to give it up
Drop something in the collection cup, for the cause
Of the sixteen bars, fast cars and jewelry
Fine silk, Cantonese wine make the rhyme shine
Bright on the seven continent
Take it to the fullest extent
Go anywhere, and live


Aiyo, spit that shit, that make niggas wanna lick they Glock
When I grab the microphone, I can't stop
To drop that shit that make you get "ahh"
Down on your face, with your the gun to your --


Yeah, P. Diddy, I know you dancin'
Crowd still movin', ladies groovin'
When the God show and provin'


Shit went something like that, I can't remember how that go..
Knawhatimean?




Gotta hang out there
Niggas keep counting us out (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Niggas ain't acting nice (back again)
Raider Ruckus (y'all muthafuckers thought I was dead)
Plans into this shit... (the Urban Icon, HG's, UDZ's)
Nigga, I got a... (the Unda Dogz, Live Son, the shit is crazy, yo)


I be House Gang, from the pits we blew
On your ass, like the Ravens, number 52
Nickel plates on the "get-u's", my chicks be true
Chain hang from my nuts, and the whips be new
On the block like the mailbox, airing for block
Neighborhoods watch, so we gotta share for the cops
Watch you glaring at pops? I don't sleep, stay aware from the plots
Bump 'em off right there in the spot
This is harder than a prison wall, shut up and listen y'all
HG's, UDZ's, physically fit to brawl
S.I.N.Y., certified, keep, out of town pussy on the passenger side
And crews, east side, splashing the five, mashing the drive
Big face nigga, fashion is live
Like son, check the bodies 'fore you buy that gun
Fuck with HG's, nah, don't try that son
Here's a jewel for you kid, you can eye that one
Or you can get it fucked up and just die that young
I'm from the home where the buffalo roam
And niggas don't give a flying fuck, talk with signs up
Walk with the nine tucked, leave your eyes wide shut
Size you up for a cut, of a single buck


Yeah, we from the grits, y'all
S.I.N.Y., 10304, my nigga Live Son on the track
Yeah.. "The Fugitive" Carlton Fisk, what's good?
La Banga... Donnie Cash, strong arming this shit
Raider Ruckus...




Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
The special technique of shadowboxing


Poisonous, poisonous (word word word)
I should slap all y'all niggas for coming in my fucking face with that shit
Alright cool yeah, go ahead man...
Poisonous


Poisonous paragraphs smash your phonograph in half
It be the Inspectah Deck on the warpath
First class leaving mics with a cast
Causing ruckus like the aftermath when guns blast
Run fast, here comes the verbal assaulter
Rhymes running wild like a child in a walker
I scored from the inner slums abroad
And my thoughts are razor sharp, I sliced the mic from the cord
First to criticize, but now they have become
Mentally paralyzed with hits that I devise
Now I testify, the rest is I
Rebel INS Your Highness, blessed to electrify
With voltage of a eel, truth that I reveal
Will crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real
Caesar black down, hoodied up in fatigues
Part time minor leagues receive third degrees
Attack like a wolf pack once I pull back
The God-U and bust through like a fullback


Yo, you fourteen carat gold slum computer wizard
Tapping inside my rap vein causes blizzards
The wildlife that kills for ice trife like by the digits
Gorillas injected with strength of eighty midgets
The Earth spins, whirlwinds, rap exotic blends
Let my peeps in, niggas gasping, swallowing aspirins
With a dosage, you overdosed in rap
High explosives, my posters hypnotize with hypnosis
I sell goods, my whole Clan is on the run like Natural Born Killers
Record-breaking the album Thriller
Got access to tear gas, bombs and rocket launchers
Flow like dough, Killa Beez is what I sponsor
Your entrepreneur, pens in gear like Shakespeare
When I fuck I grab hair, collect drawers as souvenirs
Fuck yeah, my crew down German beers
My career's based on guns, throwing cats in wheelchairs
Etcetera, damage any lame ass competitor
Who try to front, get broken in fast like leathers
Whatever hot hardheads get shattered like mirrors
Beretta shots splatter your goose, scatter your feathers
Say never poetry chumps crumbs deal with graphic
Flew my family overseas, I'm maxing
If rap was crack, fully packed I be tall cats
Taxing kingpin of the rap drug trafficking
Village niggas get slapped in Manhattan
For rapping, Big Ghost steps off laughing
Ha!


Were you just using the Wu-Tang school method against me?
I've learned so many styles, forgive me


Sit back relax, fake niggas don't get turns
Watch me massage your brain with slang that's king
Projects filled with young men cause threats
Who has that? Thousand dollar chains and Tecs
Focus, the brokest niggas of life shit
These mics is like cocaine son, check the suicidal hype shit
Exchange mad blunts taste the sweepstakes
Keeping up on fakes outta state for cakes
No doubt, plus nobody amount, we making dough off
Putting fifty on the Land and Allah, it's like that
Pull ya shoes up black, matter of fact just adapt
Tie up, your black Nikes and tight hats
Corners stay surrounded with foreigners
What up, dread? Feds caught your bredren for his bread
But regardless, peace to jail niggas with charges
Unify laying in the yard with La
My Clan done ran from Japan to Atlanta with stamina
Slingers and gamblers and gram handlers
Tical light the Owl cigar, let's get steamed
Infra-red guard your beam, so seek 'nough respect
Rude bwoy you bet, keep it moving Mashallah
Pro black like tar
Designing the fly shit and stay shining
The RZA pour more beats than Cristal's fine wine
Concrete raps go to bat
With 50 other niggas on the other side of the map
Knew it's all good and all done what, we want son
Mike Tyson of this rap shit, pulling out Macs for fun


The nigga don't get mad, I got mad styles of my own
And it's shown when my hands grip the chrome microphone
Verbally I catch bodies with cordless shotties
Intriguing MCs, I keep em trained like potties
I bomb facts, my sword is an axe
To split backs invisible, like dope fiend tracks
Sky's the limit, niggas are timid and nobody knows
How we move like wolves in sheep clothes
Producing data, microchips of software
Underground and off air
The Land of the Lost, notorious henchman from the North
Striking niggas where the Mason-Dixon line cross




Another day, another dollar
I got mines, ain't got nothing to father
Fuck a role model, never had one to follow
Lot of cotton mouth rappers, I'm a hard one to swallow
Here's another hard one to goggle
Fuck your life, that's the motto
I'm nice with mics, Cus D'Amato
Drug related, blunt guts all up in your condo
Hate a noisy woman, why you all up in my convo


Let me hold something
Look at you killas, like you owe something
Stole something, give me my paper, 'fore I blow something
Right now, give me my fucking shit, chicka-blaow
I want it right now, give me my fucking shit, chicka-blaow
Shady niggas hiding the loot, you see my baby needs shoes
And the record label trynna recoupe
I want it right now, give me my fucking shit, chicka-blaow
And I mean right now, give me my fucking shit, chicka-blaow


Gun battles, so many chains on the neck
Hands and feet, niggas say I'm Shaq
Sky blue, terry cloth, low pullover
Hit ten like a 2010 new Hova
Movies on, never ran it, call me a don
Been shitting everywhere, cuz niggas can't stand it
Terminate faggots who violate us a square
Goon therapy, S.I., we don't fight fair
Beef? We can get it on, right here
And that includes y'all low niggas wearing tight gear


Sun God, and that's your target, aim right there
My money long and green like Buzz Lightyear
I'm all right here, the way I move the blow
Fuck a show, you would think it was an all white affair
Been fuego, more fire here, then you seen me
Getting money off the water like a pall bearer there
No Newports, Marlboro's here, go smoke that
The smoke in your face, bitch, I ain't never cared
Get shot down when the Ghost smell fear, let me hold something
Look in your face like you owe something




I'm playing for the 'bucks' like Hakim Warrick
Nickel bag in the park, my team on it
They want it like that and the street, is dry as a well
Hell, that's why I sell crack on the beat
I ain't trynna just happen to eat, I'mma make a nigga dance
Even if I got to clap in the street
This is something like lock up, murder behind bars
A warrior, my story defined by my scars
Seven thirty verbal, my word work circle
You a jerk, fool, I burn you like your birdds do






Shootouts, suicide car chases
Pulling loot out, bulletproof Scarfaces
Sharp fades, black Clark Gabe
Welcome to dark ages, hanging in dark places
With dark faces, escaped on bail
My souls in the street, police on the coat tails
Oh well, got a bitch named Gail
She look so good, her tail is for sale
Before L's fell, she scrambled the reefer
My foot so far in her ass, she can taste my sneaker
I pop champagne, like every day was Easter
Better, check that bitch, before I beast her
Tally the dough, slice the pizza
Despite the features, I hold a player's crown
I step in your town, snake skin down
Let off a round, check it how it sounds


Statepens ain't part of the plan
Need weed, guns & grams? (I can handle that, fam)
The pops life, but it's only for fam
A quick six figure scam (I can handle that, man)
It's real life, I got blood on my hands
And make the product expand (I can handle that, fam)
Yo, fuck scrams, try'nna front on my Clan
It'll only take a grand (just to handle that, man)


Yo, bottles pop, llamas and Glocks, kamikaze cops
Pop shots off of dollars and blocks, it's the
Regular regular, honor my spot
Whether flips, rubber gribs, top shotter stay hot
Swallowin' shots of Henn' rock, got the shit locked
Whether, gators and crocs, widebodies'll drop
Model bitch got vicked, never promised the rock
I'm a live one, that's why honey holla for pop
Hustle man, I ain't try'nna make a collar for cops
Like the, sun in your eye, with the knowledge I drop
Or like the, gun on your side, when the drama get hot
Chameleon through the streets, cuz they watchin' my ops
Full sign with the grind, get it started off top
Well known, still home, and your out of the box
Record day, with the thirty eight, dodgin' the NARC's
Hood to hood with the gangstas, I'm watchin' the plots




You ain't never been a hustler, why you try'nna act like one now
You front clown, you can get twisted like uptown's
Heard about your record, you're butt, clown
On the Island, deaded on your bogey, how you can't get a bus down?
Never heard of you, like a pump pound
Call me "Buckshot", believe me, everybody gon' "Duck Down"
Catch you while you postin' your pedestool, family so broke
When I clap, your mom can't even bet with you
Show you motherfuckas what heavy do, hold a lot of weight
And you running with "knicks" like Marbury do
I ain't try'nna cop the Chevy, shit, I'd rather
Leave this pussy nigga bleeding like I popped his cherry
When I come through the block, they leary
Shit, I got this nigga standing with dogs like the cops at the Ferry
Pray to God that my hammer don't jam, Wu-Tang be the Clan
Understand, I can handle it man, yeah






Yo, hold on, this is the way that I'm cut, right?
Or why I sing, how I dipped under red lights
Martini's is Ghost Deini's, stretched out
On stage with the gauge, flash the TEC like Clint East'
Polo drawers, valour headband, Genova convertible couch
In the back, with the two nightstands
I'm the man, nigga, when I come through dressing rooms
Had the goose ready, renting cream and a bag of shrooms
And a nice suite, room service every five minutes, I need a foot massage
Tell the massause, she can't do it for me, do it for God
I got the mix CD on pause with all DeBarge
Oil me up, please, my nuts, read me a story
Tuck me in, something like the seeds'll say
Pass me the cold fresh squeezed OJ, I got five hundred
Under my pillow, after I'm done, do my DJ


Cause of that, I'ma rock the show tonight
The Twat Team, gon' get those hoes tonight
That's Theodore shit, if you in your whip
Two step, you slipped, get your whole crew wet


Stand like the Eiffel, move spiteful
Sport the Nike shoe, nice with the mic since high school
Fuck who like who, fend to not, niggas, trifeful
Plot cycles, to get dough, it's so delightful
Criminal IQ's, spiral convo's with the sky view
This is what I do, pioneer, my peeps Power Rule
Fuck Yacub, I'm factual, true and living
Polo polobos with the true religion, no superstition
This beat is sort of proof to listen, and hear the real
So you New Jack niggas kneel, sit it still
Lick a fifth, get your piff and chill, fix your grill
It's ill, seen the game vanish in air
From DeLores to the glamourest gear, show and prove
How I move, you know hammers is near, never fool
Appear rude, though my manners is there, get it straight
Say my grace, before stuffing my face


Cause of that, I'ma rock this show tonight
Hustle hard, I'ma get that dough tonight
Crime Money, all we do is just two step
Slip up, and get your whole fucking crew wet


Fuck the radio, the corners respect, Soldier I
I'ma about to get fly like I'm boarding a jet
Watch your mouth little homey, I demolish your rep
I'm like Mohamed Atta, when I'm bombing the set
Bottom line, you got a problem with Deck
I'm like the police gun, son, a nigga name pop in the 'jects
Hate in your blood, green eyes, watching my step
I'm all money like the Pres, no stopping the rest
This is Stones and grown man poking his chest
Play hero watch the K blow a hole in your vest
Why I flow like I know I'm the best, cause I'm spitting the piff
Half of y'all dudes rolling with stress
Come and see me, son, you know the address
10304 block work, first homey, show me the checks
Hood crooks living over the edge, Ghost saying nah
That's a good look, focus, respect, yup


Cause of that, I'ma rock this show tonight
Light your weed, pop ya ects', let's go tonight
House Gang on the dance floor, two step
You out of line, get your lame ass crew wet




"Just talk about..."


Put your hardhats on we going to work
Get a little dirty


This is Hazmat rap, scratch that
When this is rocking see niggas droppin' like the NASDAQ stats
Black popping like a ass that's fat
Trapping that cash, on top of that I'm getting ASCAP stacks
I-N-S, I never sleep
Meaning I'mma all-nighter liver than the Tribeca streets
Untouchable, is never in your reach
Straight to the bone they call me bonafide homes, then capice


Y'all be on that other shit this is that gutter shit
Your team be junk mail just a waste of a click
Telling me to axe somebody so I had to hack somebody
Pop a stupid question and I leave 'em with my hatchet bloody
Rappers study and they tried to gather data from me
I earned my stripes so my wets match my rugby
Raps is ugly and all the hoodrats love me
All thugs go to heaven but no cats above me
Nah...


Time for this realness


Fly like I'm gone in a cape
Rebel I, try blocking my pace
Get rocked in your face
Y'all old, there's homage to pay
Or catch a vist from my young G's, I don't need problem with Jake
Just shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Give me the mic and watch a nigga display
Born penitentiary hard, oh my god
Yeah I'm from the home of the mobsters, crooks, and cons


Fuck Patrn, you need shots of Cortisone
You ain't Corleone or N.O.R.E. 'n' Capone
More like Norah Jones with your boring poems
Save that Rambo act for Stallone
That styles got a thousand dads, mine's at an orphan's home
Smoking on the porch alone, killing it with a gorgeous tone
Flow bellissimo like I record in Rome
Im in the water, Orca clone whaling on y'all
Rouge status, no Palin on y'all
I be back in the game, attacking lames, assailant on y'all
Im Spidey scaling on walls
This is pharaoh biz, why your man bailin' on y'all
I be shredding like I got Eddie Van Halen on call
Hell Cycle transmission, never failing on y'all




Hang glide for my nigga Tical
Yo, word to God we run this whole shit Son (no doubt)
Right that's my word, guaranteed you're dealing with the invincible (no doubt)
(I'm specialized in swordsmanship)
That's my word, Persian Legacy one time, one time
That's the science of the black man
Stationary niggas, have fun on this right here
Yo Shorty cross your arms
Gonna rock niggas to sleep this year (throw your leather up)


Blade thrower, sword swinga, killa bee ringer
Rocky road roll dark greener
Cream fademas, name your God-U Kareema
Shout out Medina, federaloes Noxzema
Me, jewelery cleaner Million Man March screamers
Ray Catena, cut your joint Wolverine
The Longines, wrapped around the wrist, law seen her
How I got that yo, threw out the macker named Gina
Bust a shot, seen her, it richocheted, tapped Tina
Now I'm out, lampin in Korea with Talima
We moseyin, sweatsuit Adidas, best believe
I got the black heater little joint, probably Moschino
Yo Bobby Robby whattup, Max tried to follow me
Sadaam loungin, clean up collect, like the laundry
It's time yo swerve like the Nike line
Windbreaker Laker throw a jump shot scrape her
Statuary yo floatin that snatch-uary
Aiyyo, blow a hole in your limo, weed pass the dutch


Yo this is MC wizardry, killa bee invasion
Men of respect, blessed with wisdom of the ancients
My words are blatant, lacerate necks for statements
I launch like lead projectiles, straight out the basement
I suplex your rep, left ruined like the Aztecs
Parasites, double edge dice your larynx
My hip-hop, is quarantined locked inside the detox
Under key lock, it's like b-block and E-Glocks
You're ill, your trail ends, thoughts are frail
I strike the cypher, and let one survive to tell the tale
Of my state of grace, I raise the stakes on snakes
Knock em off like the big eights for takin up space
Never did fear em, stick em with the truth serum
Who sent em, arrest em before my charge is ended
Designated hitter flows split the transistor
Kinetic globes light when it shine, burns your retina
Urban journal, plus eternal broadcaster
Before and after, I be Self Lord And Master


I be the Ironside, get touched, with the chloride
Take walk with the Nine-Finger bandits worldwide
Shaolin hillside, full of homicides
FUCK you dissatisfied the double dyed black brown iodine


Yo, box talk sequence, powerhouse kickout
Eyes dusty, wet, butt-naked with my dick out
I'm direct, golden best, golden chest is blessed
Scarce chapter, snatch a batch of Winterfresh
It sound farfetched, mountain men that be rich
You get buckshot, dummy-clapped, mummy-wrapped and stitched
The Jeffrey Dahmer Notre Dame-r sing the song the strongest
Brute force bullethole straight through your chorus
Shank you with the think tank, harmony cake cut
A can of ass-whoopin', Flurry shake break, you fucks
Struck, love crooks, why for lyin hooks
Chef cocaine cook, a marvelous book
This deathbed doctrine, paper for the youth
What remains, a saber-toothed tiger in the booth


Last night, I took a trip down to Crown Heights
Fast life, females are trife, stay tight
I detect that parasite, satellite
RZA beat makes me wanna fight get hyped, come to do shows
My slang sound write secretary type
Backflip on the mic, I'm the poor black man
Workin hard for the grand, I understand clear
Don't fear, peep my new gear it's different from yours
My style drop like drawers, you see me on tours
Don't you wait to say peace, the kid from the street
Put my technology on the track, just then the core attack
Wu article, Cappa, five, CD attack
But my talk stage live killa beehive
Bermuda my life angle, rectangle gold fronts
Bring the gold bangle, never make me throw darts
Check out my arts, when I release my smarts
Hot like Pop Tarts, aim me at the charts




The Wu-Tang Clan will rise again
There are many of us, all working for the good of the Wu-Tang
Die


So get your egg crashed by my Hellz Wind Staff
While the pictures broadcast and splash to tell the news
Like Katie Chung, how the bullet collapsed his lung
His father watched in horror as he swallowed his tongue
Another youth dead before the age of 21
Left his son to grow in the ghettos of the slums
Where the shots echo for twisted metal for cash flow
React slow nigga and get P.L.O
By the lone gunner who took revenge for his brother
Who got slain last summer by a cocaine runner
A new year is dawning, new crews is forming
Rival gangs warring, blood steadily pouring
The streets are deep son, every day is like a rerun
So I reach out and try to teach one
But 85% uncivilized content
No tolerance so a lifetime is spent
Behind a cage bent smoked out and on a park bench
Killer instinct, slave rap niggas get lynched


So yo break that nigga arm fast as a fuck
Tell Ra, Goldie left my beige jacket in his truck
To all you slew-footed penguins, ducking from these
Hot rocks that's flaming, chocolate for all you rap Damians
Spraying cards espionage, dodgeball square hard
Strip bars, no bras, wet leotards
In the making, next album 'Blood on Chef Apron'
Keep a Gambino PlayStation in your playpen
Discovery Channel, cats the Book of Daniel
Coke blunts hot as a fuck swatted bamboo
High school dropouts, baseheads get knocked the fuck out
On the regular for robbing a good nigga house
Rough cut raw doses, the unexplainable
Hot rock lava, gringo throw the Frusen Gladj


What you know about this specialist armed dangerous?
Hit you close range with this madness
Unique design shine like a deep dish
The beat kick technique split up your weak shit
Yes, the rhythm, the Rebel
Alone in my level heat it up past the boiling point of metal
Living legend, veteran known to set trend
Lethal weapon, step through your section
With the force like Luke Skywalker
Rhyme author, orchestrate mind torture
Live performer, bid the mic saynara
Borderline to insane, I rain firewater
Tape recorder, can't be saved by a court order
I got my sword across your throat, you choke


We on the run with the golden guns, get you none
When it reach out and teach someone, blaze their buns
Now I'm guilty by association
Times of blackness eclipsing the Sun, target practice
Commence when I throw these darts at these rappers
Ricochet, hit the charts, bloody your mattress
Hold me down, Wu bloodkin, I'm going in
Shooting bullets at the top ten, rhyme concoction
Blend like chameleon
All these niggas want cheese, is we mice or men, word up
We can go platinum but then still can't get no satisfaction
Once again back on the block crumb snatching
Blowing backs in cold blooded 9 assassins, time for action
Johnny Unitas, handle that like arthritis
Still, hold a golden touch like King Midas


Drowning problems in Heinekens imported from Holland
Getting boosted off of Killa Bee pollen
Stone columns get stacked by drum tracks, smack loud like gun claps
Pin a crab to death with a thousand thumbtacks
The Wu centerfold, it be's the Wind Ninja scroll
Soul edged blade controls your Interpol
The Fig Newt', fruit from the forbidden tree root
I stay secluded in the Chamber training new recruits
With Fatal Guillotine, the black hooded team what it means
When bullet screams from the hot Glock like rock from a sling
Pushed through like George Bush Operation Whoops
Shots get popped on the block causing blood to gush
From digital to analogue, the Wu-Wear camouflage
My entourage squad be stomping through Zanzibar
Like herds of cattle, RZA plays the wall like a shadow
Connecting Brooklyn/Shaol like the Verrazanno-Narrows


Stash the cream though, Iceatollah ice style gleamo
Lex graffiti name Ramo, hold em we rolling asking me though
Raps is hotter than hot tamales in Toledo
Pussy that shit she passing off to me though
We wax Ajax niggas with an axe, Maxamill
You could crash a mil got your back still
Scold em and fold em like the thousand dollar bills
Sit back eyeing y'all niggas out
Fakes that delegate we spitting fire out
Verb burglar, design the Wally shoe store reserve a jet status
Guyanese bird up on my mattress
Watch me mack this, Ralph Lauren goose incite a fashion
Yo, these hands is flooded and they mad quick
Strong approach like magnets, custom wood crane name
Styling rich, rsum the waves and one chain
Feeling mics like, wheeling a bike, slide like
Step on his Klondike, get your dart right, we moving on it like
Wind breaker niggas get they face broke, jewelery get snatched
Magazine right on the low, fuck y'all cats




Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
The special technique of Shadowboxing


Poisonous, poisonous (word word word)
I should slap all y'all niggas for coming in my fucking face with that shit
Alright cool yeah, go ahead man...
Poisonous


This game is mine fool get back
Read these lyrics and get cataracts
I'm coming at you swinging with a battle axe
If you wanna battle ask bitch I'm not your average I'll stick to you like a cactus you're not a rapper you're a bad actress
Motherfucker I'm savage eat you alive like cabbage leave you covered in bandages
Spitting so fast you didn't know if it was spanish
I'll take more advantage of you like any man on the planet
Damn it motherfucker you are a faggot you talk more shit than your ass say one more thing and I'll cram it with a rodent
Reload my pen like heroin and start spitting, killing, frenzies at all you emcee's then come back for more like you was Monica Lewinsky whore
I stuff you with lyrical bullets like adjectives in my margins so tell your sarge I'm in charge
I barge in with a mouth like a .38 Magnum, Shootin', Splatterin', your brains like Flapjacks and Bacon
I'm a product of M.E.T.H.O.D Man and Rakim rock your whole team
I reign supreme, Will Rehm, ain't nothing to fuck with so bring the ruckus Suckas' get beat purplish, I'm serving you so bring your dish
Spitting menacing until I'm finished
If I ever meet my match I'm a strike that bitch first
Bitch this is spitboxing I'll leave you hollering, "Nurse nurse my hearts about to burst"
Cardiovascular
I'm sucking the life out of you like a vacuum cleaner
You get swept up like an old man's broom
I'm taking you to your tomb
Reached in pulled you out of your mom's womb
Replaced your dome with Shrooms
The doom surrounds the gloom then all of a sudden I throw you for a loop like "what up son" I'm the rebirth of Raekwon
Nice to know you're done with my verbal Punishment
All the shit you spit you bit but you're scared to admit it
I'm about to put an end to it
I bust rhymes infinite
We different your shit is excrement just accept it
Tracks I wreck it like Inspectah Deck kid
I'm busting lids like hit man bids
Reload my pen with more Heroin
Don't take my name in Vain
You get hooked like a line of blow to your brain, Cocaine and you wonder what the hell I need more vicodin for
I grip the Microphone like a Chrome aiming at your smug dome on Garden Home
Busting like cordless Shottie's I'm stacking piles of Bodie's like I shot up a lobby full of paparazzi waiting for Eric B. and his Compadre
Don't sweat my technique
Yo, Dead Presidents is what I'm resurrecting


Step on to Gleneden this Sadist William will spill your cranium like Salad dressin'
When I'm pressing my pen on this pad it's sweltering
When I'm spitting in the lab your face is melting like I'm tripping of an Acid Tab
Beat you Raw with my Southpaw Style you won't last sixteen rounds in this Bar fight hooks flying and Punchlines
Rhymes rattle your mind like Crooks with land mines, bombs, and Rocket Launchers
Crush your mind like a pill crusher snort it like Duster the rest of you swept up by a street sweeper
I'm a beat eater full of lighter Fluid
Everything I spit is Fire like a flame thrower
Cut you like a D-J mixer motherfucker
Step in this cypher it's over
I'm an atomic Bomb dropper Machine Gunner Rhymes is always clever
Sending you to the Rehab center for lyrical seizures
Destroying every Emcee in the 5-oh-3 vicinity
Weaponry is Heavily
Bust rhymes till your head empty
R-I-P O-D-B I'll see you one day homie
This is lyrical M-M-A
You think you strong?
Step in this octagon you're dead wrong
I'm bigger than LeBron on the jumbotron
Armed with a Lyrical firearm
Did I stutter motherfucker?
Sending Clouts in and out no doubt
Spitting more bars than Alcatraz, tougher than Prison Guards
I'm Al Capon on this Microphone
I got it going on
You're dead wrong
Reload more Heroin
I step off, laughing



"He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and"


He don't really dance in the club, sip passion for thugs
Head bobbin', one hand on the slug
Wit a centerfold, head to toe, dress to kill
Wit his shit spillin' out the S6 pills
But he don't trick or spend presidents, basic
He's so sick, he's a resident patient

"He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and"


He move wit a too live crew, white Nike shoe
Slidin' through, eyein' them boys through the rear view
He shine like chrome 25's
On the street, like a low ride, he don't hide
Seen wit the finest of queens, in designer jeans
Treat 'em like Midas the King, though he treat 'em mean

"He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and"


No, he don't care how you feel
No, he don't care what's your name
No, he don't care who you wit
No, he don't care what you say
(Ain't this bullshit, try your luck
Cuz he don't give a flyin' fuck!)

"He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and"


He's only got about four friends
You know him, probably got drugs in both Timbs
Boppin' on hard blocks, at large wit the cops
His song rock in nail saloons and barbershops
He talks of life and commands the set
He walks up right and demands respect

"He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and"


He don't care what they (fuck is they?)
He hot like a summer day up in the Bay
A child of the ghetto, he fought through everything
And still "undisputed" like Wesley and Ving
Baggy jeans, two tone boots and big leathers
Certified live and his name is Inspectah

"He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and"



"He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and"


He stand out the packs, son spit the iller bars
And smoke chocolate weed and vanilla cigars
He a sexist, only need birds for one thing
Got a fetish, for shorty to work the tongue ring
The cool one, he live like a web cam
Not a follower, gopher or yes man

"He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and"


He got missiles, to turn your block to dust
He got issues, he'd rather not discuss
And he posts up, low in the cut with his drink on
Linked on, mami in pink, wit the mink on
He a two time felon and parolee
Made man mobbin' like Vinny and Tony

"He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and"



"He's a rebel, he's a rebel and, he's a rebel, he's a rebel and" (3X)




I'm an Animal, Animal, and House Gang is my life
And I'm gon' ride til I die, ride til I die, til the day I lose my life
I'm an Animal, oh, and House Gang is my life
And I'm gon' ride til I die, ride til I die, til the day I lose my life


Fuck you know about this Animal life, I'm from Homicide Housing
By the thousand, niggas handling pipes
And we wilding in the cameras and lights, don't give a fuck
Who we touch, we demanding these rights
It's like we stuck to our hammers for life, so let the cannons ignite
From our fam, raid the cannon for life
Hold your steel, when you hope a nigga fronting, feel like jumping
Got to still waiting, so it's nothing to slump, I'm still taking
And if I'm lying I'm dying, and if I'm dying
It's somebody coming with me, so somebody come and get me
Donnie, you can find me in the lobby, where ya kids be
Shotty to the body, and your wisdom
Ain't no problems, I ain't hiding, come and get me
I'm riding, and my squad is coming with me
That's Donnie, nigga...


Don't under estimate me, because
I rough with upstate and blow torch
But oh, oh, oh, you don't know
You can't take one blow, no, no, no, no




It ain't nothing to knife you down, box you up
Knock you out, use cold water to wake you up
Since something horrific await to shake you up
To get me aggy, it really don't take too much
The weed, the haze, that had me, calm, but I'm ready to jump
Not off ecstasy, but when my team thump
It's a family feud, homage should only be paid by dues
I know killas, who pump John Coltrane for mellow moods
Or Al Green when they riding on beef
Heat, under the lap, on top of the seat
Easy to back out, for unexpected New York streets
And the magnet to the problems it bring, that come with it
We run with it, survival of the fittest, and you can't fuck with it
Go the bus ticket, straight out of dodge
Or hit the I-9-5, do a ninety in the car
Get up out of here, as fast you can, we know who you are




Don't you know when that Animal, end of your sight
Either feed him or run for you life
It's a concrete jungle, and I'm all right
Yankee fitted, white Nike's, and I know apply pressure, bust pipes
And my HG's, UD'z, we just the type
To do you in, that's my Annamette, checking the ruger
And my Animalz, stay strapped, packing maneuver
Clappin' is usual, Homicide Housing is crutial
Smoke purple when the shadow cops circle the hassle
Oh, it's natural, that's the way Animalz play
I'mma ride til I die, that's how what Animal live
Stay grizzly, Carlton Fisk, that swift, four fizzy
With the Lex key, and a thorough inspectery
Same shit, different day, know me, the Fugitive's back
And off parole, cause them faggots couldn't hold me
Donnnie Cash, my little homey, La Banga, House Gang Co-D




House Gang... Urban Icons...
UD'z... UndaDogz... and we Animalz
Gat y'all niggas, watch out...
Yeah... Ruckus...




Aiyyo fuck these technicolor dreamcoat lookin ass niggas
Suckin 5 Pee-pees like articuno blizzard
Trilluminati want my grind gold and my shotty
Shouts out to wheelchair jimmy dont make me catch a body
Greatest eva like ocarina of time
Bitches always sucking on my cockarina of grime
Making dick jokes like a 2001 nasty track
Inpsectah deck? dayyum thats a nasty track
Rap niggas, yeah im the best of em
Yall homosexual niggas -- too much estrogen
In the basement puffin on some purple headband
Yo girl in the back givin urkel head, damn
I rep hawaii dick tall as hauleakala
Car full of ratchet bitches sucking cock a lot
Blue dreaming bout a sobriety holocaust
Not killing it game, yeah I just lost




Ayo, ayo, ayo, high potency Thai, smoke a bag of black
And feel the vibe, born to be wise, we form on a rise
The corner mean five, horns in disguise, throw on your slides
Young niggas racist, smokers is basing
We seen the eyes laying up, playing the cut, what?
Stay in the truck, something told me duck, folded me up
My shoulders struck out of luck, fucked the Pradas up
Fell in a daze like a Golotta snuff, niggas tried to body me up
I'm in the lobby bleeding, niggas in the waiting office probably eating
And sprinting and beefing when they heard the shots called the precinct
And seen barber nieces beast, some niggas shot Shallah features
And shot through his Ellesses, bent the spinal cordless creatures
I'm gagging and flagging a cab down
Guess who in the Benz wagon, dragging my sound down macking
It was Dale Breedy the greedy, conniving-ass snake genie
Cop with a bikini who murdered charge and benini
I'm feeling wheezy and I'm drained from the cheeba grieving
Ain't even looking decent, seeing police niggas reaching


That splash against my hollow bones
That rocks my...


Fleeing the crime scene speeding
Beefing leaving behind cream, not even peeping that I was leaking
Won't see the precinct just got a recent case beaten
Still jakes are creeping, don't blow your spot, stay the weekend
Keep the Ruger peeling who's squealing few knew the dealings
Keep the steel concealed in cause we got no time for feelings
Eyes on the building guards are on the corners illing
Million dollar block villain plotting on a killing
Feel like, a superhero talking like a true Deniro
They boost his ego found him broke down, reduced to zero
Cops fill reports hoping I'll reveal my source, source


That splash against my hollow bones
That rocks my soul


Outside the check cashing, flashing, dipped in fashion
Five cherry-faced faggots tried to cash in
They keep laughing  Ghost, you'll get your face bashed in
Who gave you these privileges son? Why you maxing?
And we... fiending to take those
Move slow, I'm hearing how you broke Rob's nose
And I heard you keep a banging hammer, golden brass
Diamonds embroideries that was stolen that you haven't reported, G
Make very little noise, my shit hiccup
Don't make this big stick up big up me and the boys
I thought for a second then chose rather than froze
Had the Gem Star in my hand... yo, what the fuck?
Yo, that's when I ripped Timothy, snatched and dipped
Jumped right in back of him, had the mini axe tool, faxed him
Shots rang off, bing-boggle-de-dum





The sword it's the best weapon of all
Two sharp edges, and a long spine
The blade is very thin and it's easily damaged
You remember that: the vital thing is the point
Pay special attention to it, your life could depend on it



Verse 1: Rebel INS

Berettas and Glocks, consecutive shots
Forever it pops, catching double life just for reppin the block
Brotheren or not, the cream cause metal to pop
When the smoke clears fake niggas setting up shop
I knew murderaz who blew trial and came home king
Some of ya'll catch a weed charge and start to sing
Criminal life, sinister trife, few are built for
The section of land young blood was spilled for
Not to mention the twenty beans he killed for
His fifty cal shells left in the building door
Animal rights, both sides hands on them pipes
Kenny rogers with the dice how we gamble with life
Cameras and lights a blind fold damage ya sights
Its real, another brother got hammered tonight
Its cold black, co-jacks tappin ya phone jack
Livin by the code I was shown by the old cats
Little nigga grown now totin a mack
Shorties sixteen telling me she blow my back
A day in the life the neighborhood hype
Johhny got blaze and blaze getting money and money got age
He a 86 O.G. who sniff now
Sugar hill romeoo cat who bring ya clique down
Not only was he sniffing the work
They found the wire tap when they ripped open the shirt
Its no hurt, the burners ah burst, the murders occur
Momma on the strip, daughter learning from her
Fish nets with the big breasts working the curb
Quick sex for a big check thirsting to splurge
Drama at night, the ??? start sparkin the light
Its part of the life the high is like bacardi on ice
Party all night and pray that ya make it till morn
In the cursed earth all things sacred are gone
In the hall by the gate door wavin the 4
Keep ya ears to the street or ya face to the floor
Either or heat flame for the cause beat jake and the law
Keep takin keep bangin for yours
Son you'd rather be loved than feared
Theres a price on ya head and you can catch slugs from here
The drugs the beer had a nigga bugged for years
Liviing a lie the mask can't cover the tears
Gotta rise up from under the stairs
It never rains in souther cal but its thunderin here
Just look, the killers the crooks the villians the jooks
The flowers by the grave of the witness who looked
Mob style in the broad day business is took
Dirty cop on the tape gettin hit off the book
Heaven for some they squeeze off weapons for fun
Tattoo on his back states second to none
Hard body who died for his section of slum
If its hood than its like that wherever you from




First of all, you a blog thug, YouTube goon
HOUSE NIGGA! Your food get chewed up rude
I see you like to put your world online
Ain't nobody checking for you, they checking for your girl's behind
While your homey in the bedroom, lust in his eyes
While you filming dumb shit, they probably fucked a few times
Wow, how you Slaughterhouse? You barely get a nod
I'm convict benching, daily in the yard
So I'm built like Optimus Prime
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I'm, way ahead of you, obviously I'm better too
Deck show him how to properly rhyme
He on mine, like he didn't see the property sign
Lyrically blunt, I'm broad day, physically dump
This nigga's life's a publicity stunt
But, he think he fever, I ain't a believer
Def Jam chucked him, they ain't feel him neither
Why are you talking like the Morpheus of rhymes?
When my first shit, sold more than all your shit combined
Worshiping Tahiry's doing something to your mind
I should get your tummy tucked, just for jumping out of line
Man, really? Name me three Joe Budden songs
Don't worry, I got time, I cut the song


Oh, oh man, umm, three Joe Budden songs, umm...
Damn, uh, the -- Pump It Up!
Uh, agh -- ahh, shit... this for a hundred thousand, too?
Ahh, I'm bout to blow the shit!
Ahh... did I say Pump It Up?
Oh, oh ---


Still waiting, Resident Patient, stay sick
Basic, the truth's on, face it, taste it
Hunt it to the head, make him retract statements
My next move, probably increase your hatred
Take it how you take it, HBO Bodie
State wide ain't nobody rocking no Joey
I'm a legend, Meth let you live, I'mma set it
And I ain't on the phone but you get the 'text message'
I'mma rep til the death, with my life put on it
If it's dollars, then it's cents, then I'm likely on it
I'm deep in the pits, where the trife be on it
Only hood you be in, got Nike on it
HOUSE NIGGA! You don't see the strips
Your fuzzy house shoes underneath your bitch
And I ain't got to talk bout Gloria Velez
Stalker ass nigga, you was calling her, obsessed
Computer love scrub, think you safe behind a desk
Like we won't call Redman and get your address
Yeah, yeah, we got a problem, Houston
Eyes all swoll when the God repute them




Like we need ghostwriting, mothafucka, we the titans
You catch your head cracked with no dice, man
Hood like the dollar van, Taliban carrying bombs
Verbal onslaught, warhawk, blowing your flag
Throw in your towel, there's no chance, load up the mag
Hold down the Shao, return home, holding your dome
Glorious king, I wish you would
HOUSE NIGGA! Couch gangsta, think you Suge?
Nah, you the fiend out, halfway house cat
Missing tooth rap, touch Deck, I doubt that
"Pump It Up" was wack, you swagger jacked "Scenario"
All that other trash, couldn't last in my stereo
Couldn't beat Lloyd Banks, couldn't beat Meth
Couldn't beat Jay-Z, what you got left?
I show you what substance is (uncontrolled, nigga), ruggedness
Like fifty ATV's, label me G
You a HOUSE NIGGA! Take your slippers off, Microsoft crook
Never seen a juks, never seen your wifey cook
Never seen you sitting with your seeds reading books
Wanna show the mass, that ain't work, so you sold your ass
Showed the world you lame and no control you have
You Google MC, your feet the only 'sole' you have
Act like you strong in the pits, up north
Get your manhood took, right along with your kicks
Like you got it going on in The Bricks, nigga please
Only ones know the words to your song is your kids
And this here, won't even boost my career
This is kid's stuff, plus your name ain't big enough
I said 'fuck it, I'd do it for fun'
Have 'em like 'Damn, Deck, why you do it to, son?'
Cause he, stupid or drunk, loose wit the tongue
Plus fronting like he want it, should of knew what become
Ask around, who dispatching the raw?
Throw our name on the scale, my side probably crash to the floor
Cause I'm heavy like the classic Ford, before I fall
I will shoot, stab, kick, bite, scratch and claw
I mean fistfight, grab and all, I'mma get like that's for sure
I'mma give right after the brawl
Small timers, too late for you to come up
You won't get a name off me, you get done up
HOUSE NIGGA! You don't get your hands dirty
They don't respect you outside of Jersey


They don't respect you outside of Jersey, man
Nobody fucking knows you
You trying to disrespect the legend
We king size in this shit, man
Understand that, I go to mothafucking Germany
Japan, Honolulu, France, Ethiopia, Croatia
Niggas know my mothafucking name
Who's you? Who's you?
They don't respect you outside of Jersey
Bow down to the face of greatness, mothafucka
Yeah, you better recruit everybody
The war is on, nigga, the war is on, nigga
Johnny Blaze, you know I got you, man
This nigga is fish food, straight up fish food
You wanna swim with the sharks?
I'm waiting for your response, nigga
Five minutes long, next time I'mma give you eight
A dirty eight, straight to the face
Holla back, nigga




Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump
Troops on the left, fight to the death
Fam on the right, infrared lights
Wolves in the back, ready to attack, for what
Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump


I pop off like a mobster boss
Angel hair with the lobster sauce
Summertime can't top the scorch
Check my hot broad, I dropped the Porsche
FBI wanna watch the force, trying to lock my source
Where I'm from, hear the macs, techs, Glocks and fours
Hide the safe, nigga, lock the doors
No respect for the cops and laws
In the land where your own blood brother still plot for yours
Seen things that'll drop your jaw
My soldiers got dropped in war, see the mural on the project wall?
Won't stop til I copped them all
Wanna block me? You gots to brawl, trade shots and all
Cuz I ain't on the clock for talk
The Spot Rusher, blow down the spot for sure
Still break off the block with raw, my stock is more
The General, watch your board


Deep pockets with the eight on me, sleep with the safe in the wall
The camo's on with the make-up and all
Swap six 45's, twist reefer in the flicks, papi whoadie ride
Bolt his gun off, from know your horse, she lied
Fly criteria, bury me in Africa
With whips and spears, and rough diamonds out of Syria
A true don, only I could do wrong
Rock fitted hats, get crack money and drive a sick blue joint
Retard-less, I'mma blow regardless
Resume is straight up live, I shank niggas up for larger E's
And speak with the youth in the spot, eat the fresh fruit in the crop
All these hip hoppers eat cock
You could see me in the street or the yacht
I'd rather be promoting your block or buying fresh sneakers with gwops
Yo, I'm an ill dude, always been a real dude
Don't fuck around, I will spill on you and kill you in the field, boo


Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump
Troops on the left, fight to the death
Fam on the right, infrared lights
Wolves in the back, ready to attack, for what
Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump


Leather jackets on, rocked up rock stars
Treacherous bank robbers, the plan go dub, we pop guards
The team gotta eat, seeds is hungry, that's why we ain't scared
To dump on niggas, our guns is chunky
Usually we bust niggas down with bats, swell up they joints
Elbow, wrists, they shins get cracked
We still humiliate, brutalize, Ruger pop, pulverize
Still got gear in the closet, that's stupid live
From Benetton rugby skullies, Oshkosh conductor jumpers
The train hats fit me lovely
Rae job is to make sure the coke is fluffy
While I politic his birthday bash with Puffy
Bagged Nia soon as I linked up, the kid ain't inked up
I'm an old mummy, my gold weigh as much as King Tut (yeah, yeah)
Slippers, robes is minked up, under the doorag, bro (uh, yo, yo)
My three dimensional fade is clean cut


Man, ya'll niggas ain't shit to us, still a pistol bust
Split your melon like I split the Dutch
Got a lot of piff to puff, and I ain't come for fisticuffs
Or for the cop that wanna clip the cuffs
Man, is Staten in this bitch or what?
Don't get it twisted, we, twist it up and even mixed with dust
See these fans can't resist the rush, they Wu-Tang for life
Scarred for life, they can't forget the cuts
Got a whole line of classic joints, and while you at it
Pass the joint, let's push this music past the point
Of no return, til it crash and burn, down the ashes
Then placed inside Ol' Dirty Bastard's urn
When it's my time to go, for sure, ya nigga goes to war
What you think I brought these soldiers for?
To send shot, like forget me not, at any nigga
Respect, bitch, that figure they gon' get me got


Heheh, your basic kung fu's no good
You can't move fast enough!
And you don't have enough strength!
And your body movements are like a street fighter!
It's too easy for me to trip you up!
(Fighting sounds)
Heheh, how's it feel, eh?
Ah, it's no good I feel my back's broken!
Heheh, you've still got a lot to learn!




Yo, the bare facts make 'em take Flight like Air Max
Hyperdermix raps, share it and you'll both have tracks
Dope man supply fire to wax, push your wigs back
Hit ya like a tall cat, make ya relapse
Never before have ya ever heard this level of raw
My metaphors touch down like the hammer of Thor
Knee deep into the war, sirens and gats roar
Livin life, ragin bull, life's the matador
I soar, above the law, branded illegal
They still rush my door cuz I'm power to the people
Sharp as an eagle's claw, certified lethal
Keanu Reaves can't match the Speed I exceed to
Crash the party, make 'em jump like KenEvil
I take cash in advance and blast off on retrieval

"Check the bangin sounds that I invent, marvelous...

Yo, yo
I can't, won't, don't stop rockin to the rhythm
Droppin wisdom, for my niggas locked in prison
For those on the streets, rock ir in your system
One's restin in piece, in my heart ya livin
Representin all those who ain't got a pot to piss in
Went from small timer to a top position
I'm not kiddin, so what? Radio's not mixin
While shots whistlin, niggas on my block listen
To the Uncontrolled, mentally hold you P.O.W
Comin through, ain't no good, ain't no love for you
Cameleons play the wrong side of the fence
Switchin like Clark Kent when the drama commence
Ladies and gent's, my poetry's beyond intense
Find me in the trench, while you hold your spot on the bench
Best invest in me, favored heavenly
I.N.S., address me, as your excellency
Successfully defendin my belt with first rounders
Where close friends get treated the same as out-of-towners

Jurrasic insides, I rise above the norm'
Urban icon, ridin on the eye of the storm
Veteran form, spaz like memories of 'nam
Duckin bombs on the rendezvous with Miss Saigon
Calm assassin, showin my face so they can know
When on Beatstreet, I paint a picture like Raymo
On the lay-low, makin dough, aimin to blow
Got away to go, so I'm just takin it slow
]From the Shao' borough, throwin the thoroughbred flow
Echoin in the ghetto, throughout the metro
'Bout to let it go, give me some room to elbow
Watch bitches stick to a nigga like velcro
Yo, the plan is to grap what I can within my reach
Expand like the crystal white sands that fill the beach
With my hand on the piece, one eye is on the beast
Through the rhyme I teach history class and move the mass

..

I can't, won't, don't stop rockin to the rhythm
Droppin wisdom, for my niggas locked in prison
For those on the streets, rock ir in your system
One's restin in piece, in my heart ya livin *echo*

I can't, won't, don't stop rockin to the rhythm
Droppin wisdom, for my niggas locked in prison
For those on the streets, rock ir in your system
One's restin in piece, in my heart ya livin *echo*




Nowadays everybody try'na get on
They don't wanna put in work, they just ridin' along
Pretty ho in the videos, thighs and a thong
A few views on YouTube, but who's buyin' the song?
WorldStar don't give a fuck how your body the verse
They'll desecrate your mixtape, so Connie can twerk
With your three-sixty deal, boy, you're probably a jerk
On Molly, while he profit off your body at work
Public Enemy told me, "Don't believe the hype"
I strive to be the type to fight to lead them right
From the brainwash, same songs daily that they playin'
And if you disagree with the mass, then you're hatin'
When did conscious rap become corny?
Why should I let the corporates defy me?
Radio suckers never play me
But that's the HI 5@9, that shit is crazy


I feel alone in a room full of people
My body of work is food for these leeches
The Devil's a lie, illusions deceive you
We'll never find truth 'til you seek it
When you're real, they look for your weakness
When you're fake, money won't change this
They blacklisted my name in the majors
Now I'm independent, reachin' new heights, thank you
Success is in the eye of the beholder
And never worth the price your soul cost
How did something so right go so wrong?
The rules were more clear when I sold raw
Taught not to sleep, but I dozed off
And woke up with dough gone, it's my own fault
I should have known better, he showed flaws
He had something up his sleeve and his nose, uh


Came up in the game as a young buck
Put the crack down, put the guns up
Uh, funny I ain't even want much
When your money funny, then the fun's up
Sign a deal with your funds up
In the lab 'til the sun's up
'Til the label give you thumbs up
Put the ones up, dumb it down, turn the drums up
But that ain't where you come from
Our role-model sold bottles
Fuck (?), nigga livin' like it's no tomorrow
These rappers don't own shit, they Borrow
Frontin' with a mortgage and car note
Promote lust over substance
Grown man in a dress lookin' suspect
Uh, shawty used to want a rough neck
Thug nigga like baby, where the love at?


Now, this industry'll smash you
Go right past you
What's good today, my nigga?
How you gon' live when it's only gettin' bigger?
And the rage it bring out that nigga
But you tame that
Fall back if you got two-syndrome
Cause there is a way to get income
You work well with people, you're social
You're up on technology, the change in ecology
You can't lose quality cause then you're gone
Now, it's fuck the industry and all that misery
Don't bring that to me, my situation growin'
I'm  still here, I found a way to keep it goin'
When you hit the continents enough
You know where bread  at
And you know where you're dead at
Understand that, you can paint the picture
But you've got to have something with you
And an image that finish you


They got you livin' like a fuckin' trick
Suckin' on the devil's dick
Stuck at the level of a bitch
While those pimps get rich
Kept in tight situations like tight clothes
The cold night froze all assets
LPs and cassettes, CDs and MP3s
Three bank accounts seized
All because them pimps wasn't pleased
Hit you with small amounts, no more than 5 G's
Knowing damn well you can't survive without cheese
Coming live and direct from the den of thieves
Where niggas die for respect like the Genovese crime families
It's time we start studying degrees
Take apart all the fallacies
Pimp slapped by reality
Solicitation of my Nation for a salary
Conversation travels through the galaxies
Like shooting stars, introducing Lord Jamar
The Black Man is Allah, understand who you are!




"The story you're about to see, occured along the main
Trading route, on the border between the North and South..
At a small outpost called Red Clay Village."


What the fuck y'all niggas thought, huh? What you thinkin bitch?
Are you stupid son, must be stupid kid
What the fuck is wrong? It's the Wu bitch
Ain't got a clue bitch, tie ya shoe bitch

Just a chance to live, so you can see ya kids
Yo son nah, before I split ya wig
I'd rather feed you this, but you ain't wanna eat it
So now you got to FEEL IT!!

Beat changes
Yo what the, yo
Let me fuck it one more time then y'all can fuck
Y'know how we do it in the hood
Yo.. yeah.. turn the mic up, yeah, yo
Y'all niggas better rock y'all hoodies
Take money snatch jewelry, in the hood
You find the best woman lookin good
Diamond she need polishin
In my hood, all the gunshot legal
At the same time we gotta stop killin our people
Keep it in the hood, niggas walk with they gun
Keep it in the hood that's where we come from
I rep Brooklyn, home of the gangsta
I know a few murderer, drug dealer
In the hood, we speak mathematics and build
What's the total weight of the brain, Allah real
Slang jacks and hold gats, in the hood; 80 proof
Get my dick sucked on the roof of the projects
Dice game in the park, blunt sessions after dark
Movin with the Wesson
Welcome to the God we build and drop a lesson
Pussyhole testin, in the hood
Got the word from the hoodrat, shorty on the wood


Murder, bad boy ya block off ah
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah
Murder, nine millimeter me say
Murder, no time fi talk, one fi
Murder, men an' dem ah talk 'bout di
Murder, Masta Killa come calm wit nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying, me say murder


Ay yo, we boys in the hood, big bad wolves in the woods
It ain't all good, pass the goods
Deep in the project halls waitin to shine
Walk with a nine and talk with gang signs
In the hood, niggas put twenty on Hoopties
Four heads, one forty ounce and a loosie
And keep dough on the flip, a ho on the strip
And roll dick throw on the flip
Weed clouds thick enough to block the sun
Cops come, but thugs never drop the gun, understood?
Far from ya Hollywood
From day one, I vowed I would keep it in the hood
From project chicks with hips and slim waists
From five dollar plates apartment six-eighths
O.G, I spit G to the young ones
I keep it in the hood that's where I come from


Murder, bad boy ya block off ah
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah
Murder, nine millimeter me say
Murder, no time fi talk, one fi
Murder, men an' dem ah talk 'bout di
Murder, Masta Killa come calm wit nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying, me say murder


This is the place where thugs is born
In the hood - Blink to long ya life is gone
In the hood - Convicts still live with they mom
And they whole family tree is tattooed on they arm
In the hood - Crack fiends'll furnish a 'Llac
In the hood - African's be drivin cabs
In the hood - In the streets the ghetto is hot
And the illest gangsters, on the block with cops
In the hood - The ones you love'll fill you with slugs
In the hood - Babies born addicted to drugs
In the hood - We make life or death decisions
And the school system is like a minimal prison
So you can't knock the hustle or the life that I'm livin
In the hood - it ain't all good, repent or you sinnin

 (x2)
Murder, bad boy ya block off ah
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah

(Moss)
Moss, lets go


Yow, yow
I tell the Gs to pay respect unto disabled vets
When in the place of rest
Pray in tech, pray death
Praise the chef
Main event, lobster tails, crab cones
Master hotels with glass floors
Push them out yo face and pay your net
For cocaine and step
Gold chains is wet
Slow pace for pet
Go place your bets
Lowkey finesse
Broke bandages
Translate to full magnum clips
Niga dollars worth the pain or no canvases
Im Mount Rushmore
Im where the stone faced gangstas live
Thats who I run for
Where we hold them big stacks of bricks
Stacks to  flip
Bags to stiff
Im the American dream
Speed and bags a piff
With my hand on my dick
To even the ghost
Master likes to eat till she cold
Where them early guns to make sure
The beretta was pure
Pure but client fell
And I felt you cant yet define hell
So be very particular to whom you try to sell
Aye yo my Johnny Blast fast full of Johnny Cash
Stacks fat as Mamis ass
Im stretching niggas like Pilates class
Cornerstones main ringers sorta like Im Corleone
Positive you my son just like the Maury show
Off you go real identifier
On my streets pull me some petrifier
You call a dealer justified
Im a triple 3, have a G, half a B
Naturally me
So in it, No Limit, Master P
Fax killer, tax biller
My whole back guerillas
We mash up the base, we crack dealers
Them bow wows and fine bitches
Living the life where I shine
Haters on the side no eye witness
As they should though
Whats good yo
Get a nigga Moe, some of the milk yo
I am not a rapper
I am greatness personified
My words are murder
My statements a homicide



"Maybe I owe you something"


I'm not the champagne dinner time, spend the night, dim the lights
More like the boots on, sex you right, bet ya bike
She said, don't stop, daddy, make my boat rock
Whoa ma, you so hot, let me that row drop
Ahh yeah, get it girl, ready, switch position, girl
Doggystyle, rip ya curls, make that body, twist and twirl
Work it out, it's your world, know that I don't lick the pearl "Maybe I owe you something"
And I can too collect it, I don't except no credit
Here's how you clear ya debit, slide out the skirt and set it
Mami already naked, ready and fish netted
I'm bout to work you breathless, I try not to hurt you precious
First let me roll the purple, then I return to serve you
For you, like you deserve to, the fire burn eternal
Later she hook the plate up, hoping that I would stay but "Maybe I owe you something"
She be doing it, doing it, doing it well
And she was doing just fine, til she blew up my cell
I ain't fronting, I'm still checking, she a beautiful belle
She like, roleplaying, got a jungle room at the 'tel
She the type that have you creep nights, and fucked up your home
When it comes to that man shit, you stuck on your own
I know you game me all your love and got nothing to show
But yo "Maybe I owe you something"
She gleam with the latest on, jeans look painting on
I pushed up crazy strong, grinding to a reggae song
We broke at the break of dawn, blazed on the neighbor's lawn
I gave 'em all, later on, and skated cuz my paper called
Stagged off the peach Snap', damn son, I beast that
Shorty she a free stack, where do they teach at?
Plus she got the deep cat, know I had to creep back "Maybe I owe you something"
Just name a spot or place, make sure you rock your lace
Whatever, stockings, hey, it don't matter, you're hot as plain
Her nigga's locked away, that's why she out to play
I tell her "not today", and she ready to cock and spray
She do what poppa say, and I ain't got to say
And all she say is "let me ride" like she Dr. Dre
One day she flip the script, told me I got to pay "Maybe I owe you something"


We don't shred no paper, we don't even get down like that
You looking hot and all that mami, but you know
We just blow the back, get it smacked, and that's that
And it's a wrap.. you dig? I'm still checking for you though
Hahaha, I.O.U. "Maybe I owe you something"




Murder one of y'all niggas..
Get to hurtin one of y'all niggas..
Bitches, snatch the shirt off one of y'all niggas
Kick dirt


Color Glocks splitters just listen there's UFO visitors
Fly paintings remainin, reclinin pro-comissioner
One boot off he Rudolph, know he hyped flew off
Hibernatin, dead in the makin, ear-rake him, gear-rake him
Technician murderer, Wu hit the universe
Our words is crush, fingers icy slush, ringers wants Mercedes bust
Tip bottles, Movado, sailin in some Wu goggles you follow
Mail and jail letters, sendin niggas lottos
What made you murder my flow, what made you rival my clothes
What made you  fuck it, yo son these niggas gotta owe
I think a lot of flows, I flip exotic hoes
We paintin pictures if it's was drizzies, seen a lot of those
Gettin fly with Ghost, Power just buy the boats
RZA your vision is exquisite, daddy hide your scrolls
Platonic chronic shows, tonic prose
Off the meter Panasonic know, son line me a ho


Devestatin shockwaves strikin the nation
Newsflash, warn the people, assassination
The hour of detonation, pure untampered or mixed in any form
In any form mixed untampered it's pure
Dissect each line of the rhyme
Find my ingredients and nutrients
Teach patience and obediance before movement
Killer bee student enrollment
I'm out your control and expose if it's synthetic
Quote these plush degrees as I inject, there's many at risk
Slang therapist Shallah Rae
Bless the people, with magnificent wordplay




Aiyyo you know the half, some get respect, most we show the path
They quoted tracks while we spoke math, blowin fast
Expose the craft, first picks chosen in the draft
I don't flash, hoes love me cause I hold a stash
Known to blast, paramedics couldn't close the gash
Floatin past in a 'Nail with the oak dash
Show the cash, watch it blow in half, it's no fair
They goin mad, check their tape recorders and their notepads
Crabs wanna play me close and grab
Can't believe you on the canvas, I'm just throwin jabs
Where the powers you supposed to have, hand in your soldier rag
You posin bad, show your ass son, you won't last
With heavy weights that elevate the whole mass
Compose a smash, rollin grass at Ghost lab






Yeah, this that brand new Rebel I.N.S., back on the set
This shit is off the dial, Shaolin Style, better hold on to something


Yo, S.I.N.Y. and what
Hit 'em high, hit 'em low, head or gut
Yes, us, Lexus and next trucks
Flesh plush, land plus, extras
Cess, dust, whatever get you messed up
Test us, get crushed, next up
Better luck, we takin' off with jet thrust
Under pressure, they can't take the head rush
Talk to me, go and take the walk through me
Or yours truly, will screw you like a tour groupie
War duty, after I'mma call Suzy
Tall cutie, she'll do me like a porn movie
I burn thousand degrees, nothin' match me
You think you out of my league, now how can that be?
Son, you follow my lead, playin' the back seat
Ya'll ride dicks like a taxi, it's like that
Here we go..


I roll fat, holdin' a stash (it's like that)
Home girl, blowin' my jack (like that)
We boys in the mist of the noise (it's like that)
We big boys whippin' them toys (like that)
We up late, runnin' from jake (like that)
And still got money to make (it's like that)
From now until we finish the game (like that)
The world gonna cherish the name (it's like that)


Downtown blowin' my sound, blew out your Alpines
Feel me, I did it for dough, this ain't about rhymes
Cash on delivery, not leavin' without mines
Face tried to powder my shine, it's about time
To politic, poppin' the clip, bust off the hot shit
Holler this, monstrous hit, and stop ya gossip
I rep, what you expect, I took a set back
Crept back, nursin' my wounds, lookin' for get back
Forced to bring the pain, make 'em say my name
Rings have changed, shinin' like I'm Ving Rhames
Or King James, hustlin', I sling game
Sting lames, this money makin' things change
I bless heads, push past the full macs
Left for dead, raised by the wolf packs
Black hoods, leathers with the wool hats
Draw blood, don't even pull gats, it's like that


Aiyo, ya'll better kick your shoes off
And come on in!




Aiyo, this is all for my Metro card, one dollar cab niggas
Niggas who walk here, and all the ladies who stood on line in the rain
With the bouncers who let the thugs slide, come on, come on..


The streets watch, ya'll gon get ya teeth knocked
The heats hot, bustin' til the beef stop
Preach not, our goal is to reach the top
Knees drop, I light it up and clean shop
Built with better design, clever mind
Verbal tech 9, light years, ahead of my time
And I, walk with, criminals who talk shit
We talk business, the blocks is our office
Many have come, few that could walk this
Roam too far, catch static like a cordless
I'm off this, pimpin' a broad, beyond gorgeous
Gettin' lost, dippin' in twin Porsches, it's like that




House Gang... get right or get left
Yeah... yo, yo


Yo, they never catch Cash flippin' or catch Cash diggin'
In his stash, for his last, while these fag hags listen
I, cash that cooking, I fast like, put it in the bag
Flip the crack til that fag ass listen, if
Cash need cash fast, listen, it's so bad
It's no mag, when I let the mack blast hit him
Then I'mma make a black bag fit him
And casket every cat I catch with it, like I bag fast with 'em
And you can feel a back draft with him
I empty the clip, but don't trip, but you can catch tags with him
I'm glad that they mad, cats flipped them
The black make that ass dash with 'em, or that ass grasp for them
I pass like, gas in a Jag', flap drippin'
And with stash in the dash, leave his fag ass limpin'
Stagged cause he bagged that shitting
I'd rather have the last laugh rather then ever to laugh with him


You think it's a game, until I'm back again
I said we hittin' you up, and now you lay it down
Say, it's not a game, when I come around
Niggas in them black trucks, rolling with the mack tucked


I go harder when the pressure's on, think of the mess I cause
Will go from beefing and arguing til a weapon's drawn
I'mma be the one who set it off, you who I'mma set it on
Drippin' on that thang with a steady arm
I'm never scared, stay very calm, move
And I shoot through the roof, of your coupe til ya head is gone
You know I always got that magnum I with
I'll have you 'one-two steppin' like Ciara and Missy
I blackout off a stack of that stiffy
And spit line after line after line, ain't no baggin' when with me
I'm bout by business, big chips, warn these niggas
Or I'mma have to wreck something like a car collision




I kick the raw shit, get chips from grippin' the cordless
My broads flip, wicked like Halle in Swordfish
With long fifths, long dicks smacking the back side
Willie Dynamite style, mashing the black five
Attract fly dimes, do I, come and see me like
I got something two-for-five, dude is live
Dick rider move aside, do or die
C.S.I. on the scene when them rugers fly
Pusher-pusher man stay with the work, still playing the dirt
With two guns up, spraying the verse
Been flames since the day of my birth
Still flame til I lay in the earth, on my way in the hearse
I'mma a modern day Langston Hughes, my slang rules
In the land, where the vets get banged and bruised
Bottom line I'mma say and'a do, throw the dice off the wall
Get right, snatch the bank and move
My time now, I paid my dues, I represent
My environment, House Gang, waive ya tools
My time now, I paid my dues, I reprsent
My environment, House Gang, waive ya tools






"And we're back with the Legion of Doom, The Road Warrior"
"Tony Shivani, I just happened to notice, as we come on the set:
There's been a lot of talk about the Road Warriors
Losing their heart or their taste for violence
Well, we never had no hearts to lose to begin with!"


Yo
Game is overzealous, frontline
That's why his name is "soldier"
Fatal flow will do your brain like
Cocaine and baking soda
"Mi Vida Loca," banging inside of the navy Rover
Feet on your lady sofa, love it
Now she play me closer
Cream of the crop
Stock rising like the murder rate
7, Es and Deck, drop it
It was worth the wait
Verbal greats
Spoken Word, World circulate
You stacking cheddar cause you working at the burger place
Cold like the winters of Cabrini Green
See me lean, getting C.R.E.A.M. since the breakdance, graffiti scene
Heed the dreams, score on the floor
Like he Kareem
All-Star, feeling my G
You should see the team
Rebel spit effortless, rise like the deficit
Execute with prejudice
The necessary requisite
Nemesis, Netflix couldn't show you The Specialist
Heavy neck shit, genesis, to my exit


Yeah, we bang on em, CZARFACE style, slang on 'em (Its Raw!)
Fuck around, buck 'em down, switch lanes on 'em (C'mon!)
Checking my style, return to zero (It's Raw!)
Superhero with the muthafucking fangs on 'em (Yeah!)
Getting money, getting paper, bitches hang on 'em
Another victim, haters love to put the blame on 'em (C'mon!)
Flip it around and put the shame on 'em


I'm like the Bobby Flay of rap the way I flavor shit
Straight away, false moves will make you lay with fish
Take a piss, my shorty hold it cause I sprained the wrist
You know my style is Boulevard of Death- I'm dangerous
Foreign flow, they tried to detain me at customs
Let me go, I had to cheek that Iranian mustard
That's the hash, only fucking with the upper class
Cause I'm done with all the suffering like succotash
Quick with the handle, stick shift and I scramble
Pick 6 like Im Revis, kick shit like a sandal
I'm down at any time to do it
Was designed to do it
Til the money getting dusty like embalming fluid
But never zeeked out
See me 3D Z3'd out
Hundred sixty five redline'll read
I never put the weed out
Pick up your shoes and let your feet out
Just remember, honey
No getting pregnant, i'll pull the seed out
With my teeth
Yeah, 7L, Esoteric, Rebel INS, Bam Bam




Son ain't nervous, I prey on the weak
Fuck a Sunday service
Guns they buy, they for Show only
Like A.G. verses
State your purpose
You in deeper shit than 
Eighty bars equal eighty hearses
They deserved this
They used to give me flyers for this shit
So relentless
See the show? I rather see the dentist
ES reinvent this
Come fly with a pterodactyl
But fighting is sacrilegious like a Tim Tebow tackle
Cover me, I'm going in
Flowing like the blowing wind
Holier than Noah
No C.O., but I control the pen
Barbarians, we tearing them
Then we bury 'em
And if we don't, we granulate the bones
And then we wear the skin
We're here to win
You peeped the flow and tried to jack it
So I turned you to a jacket
Buffalo Bill chick magnet
So, you a cash getter, yeah you stack cheddar
In Jordan 4's, make you jump higher and rap better, yeah
I'm back, I'm at my apex for all you rap fans
I'm a hero to everybody, I'm Batman's Batman
I'm something vicious, gun in pictures
I'm under suspicion
For leaving some of these sons of bitches out
And some in ditches
And some in front of their misses
They never got a shot off
Cause my mans a lazy landscaper
Never drops the sawed off
The Godawful's 'Lo'd out
With no doubt
Don't make me break the robe out
They want tickets but the shit is sold out


"How did you know it was an ambush?"
"Whenever there is any doubt, there is no doubt. That's the first thing they teach you."
"Who taught you?"
"I don't remember. That's the second thing they teach you."




Machine gun Rap for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, linebacker nigga flash stacks
See through yellow lines, rock a fly jersey in the summertime
God, magic marker rap, bleed betadine relaxed
Wrote this, coming at you crab ass culprits
Snatch ya ice off, chilling in the back, throw the lights off
Waves, water blend, rhyme flow in slow motion
Thick snare, I'm feeling like a snail in the ocean
What's your wish? Wanna Kringle like Kris? Melodic single darts
Snap a nigga just like fish, you fucked up
Some rich niggas you done test, yo
Select the wrong apartment and niggas pulled up your dress
Style, molest that, Canal chain, nigga where ya vest at?
Flex'll make me wanna bless that, yo
Saddam Hussain niggas, light the torch, we flaming niggas
Autograph that, flatten all the main niggas


(It's Yours!)
The world in the palm of your hand
(It's Yours!)
Twenty-three million of useful land
(It's Yours!)
The seed and the black woman
(It's Yours!)
Double LP from Wu-Tang Clan
(It's Yours!)


Yo, super freak physique like Raphael Saadiq
Baby love the ganja leaf everyday of the week
Super friends wake up, deluxe gourmet beats
The night is right, I might find me a suite
It's a quarter full moon, I arrive, women swoon
Well groomed, dance hall packed, full room
Lady move, peep my glide, peep my zoom
Keep in stride, smoke the lye smoke the boom
Feel the fumes, consume toxic tunes
Hell bound, species forty ounce typhoon
The ultra-violet scream machine move your body touch
The totem pole wobble, Ark builders, God's thrust
Beams of light, stop ya breathing, it's hunting season
Honey eye-balling down for no reason
Grab her close, play post, wind and wax floors
Never mind the laws cause tonight It's yours


Stop the fader of the RAM, blast more watts through my pre-amp
Them can't stress the beat vamp the shit'll get blamp
At full throttle, hot lead propels throughout my nozzle
Crack your soul like bottles, leave you stiff as models
You fag, you couldn't pull one drag off my blunt
You couldn't punch your way out of a wet paper bag
With scissors in your hands bitch the RZA
I stand close to walls, like Number 4 The Lizard
And channel through solar panels, blast off like Roman Candles
Rap vandals, stomp your ass like Wahoo McDaniel
You cocker spaniel dogs, can't fuck with our catalog
Put your lights out and leave your brain inside a fog


It's only natural, actual facts are thrown at you
The impact will blow trees back and crack statues
Million dollar rap crews fold, check the sick shit
Explicit, I crystallize ya rhyme till you can sniff it
We live this, fitted hats low conceal the crooked eye
No surprise, verbal stick up, put 'em high
Rebel I outlaw, split second on the draw
Blow the door off this shit like bricks of C-4




Check out my beaver, baby blue Glock in the safe
Seen Dorothy in the garden getting ski row eight
We hold a belt Son, that's my word
Spot a rapper run him down, throw him out in the third, yo check it
I think like the man behind a register
Evergreen smoking estates, Divine and Power made me treasurer
With third down, six to go flash his strobe lights
I'm open, RZA hit me off lovely and I love him
With root beer thoughts, here's a tennis court for your birthday
The babyface of Rap politic with Sade
Avenging eagle crooks, rock the "W" and "Spiegel" books
Anheuser-Busch kings came through and stopped your whole Juks
Spitfire Kangols, watch Tony train a gang of hoes
Painful like hearing the news, like when your man go
Ends blow, windy at times watch the room
Sexy girl love the shit out the song, now watch her water break




Warning, niggas got no identity
I'm God though, I already know my enemy
Concentrate properly, control my energy
Look at you, you can't even hold that Hennessy
Never gon' like you, we don't have chemistry
Old number 7, only dope act Tennessee
Ain't tryna feel you and I don't have empathy
You friendly to a fault and got (hello) tendecies
Stay around masters, with Jews and recipes
Taught me it's important not to taunt my legacy
Spin on all the jinns who distract and menace me
And if you scared to death, nigga, don't be friends with me
You can catch feelings and act offensively
But you ain't tryna kill nothin' with that intensity
I know your reaction's just an act of jealousy
But you talkin' to God so retract that heresy


I realized the guy strapped over the mailbox looked kinda familiar. So I asked him, "hey, do I know you?" He said, "oh well, indeed you might."


When I pull out the pen I'm a wolf out again
Time to son motherfuckers, school's out again
The flow's distinguished
But Rap Genius makes it look like I don't speak English
Must I space out the words like Silver Surfer?
To prove that I got the skill to murder, kill a verse or
Sell out arenas like I'm backstabbing Gilbert
Nurture beasts like Buffalo Bill
He puts the lotion on the tracks
Seven continents and notions on his back
I attack the block as if I'm John Boy, Edward
You tryna get your grown man on like a tomboy
Rush your convoy, yeah, crush your convoy
I laugh at them like I'm smashed of a glass of Gin
Or 10, drunk watchin' Jim Gaffigan with the fattest win
And when they go and grab the pen I laugh again
And it feels like somebody stabbed in my abdomen
So pass the aspirin, half of these rappers are practicin'
They get detached limbs and thrown in scratch bins
Cause they has-beens
I shatter legions in arenas, blood splattered, screeches
So many lines you think I'm traffickin' African zebras
When the track bangs put us in the fast lane
Y'all are sounding like athletics founded Bobby Knight's last name
I smack lames to snack on brain, I'm that strange
I pull dimes like I'm tryna make exact change


What gives you the right to... My entire life gives me the right, mister, look at my record. Now I know why you wear a mask. It's to hide your swelled head. Who's that guy? Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know you were going back to that


Loud in person, I'ma shoot first like Kyrie Irving
These silly raps getting no claps like Miley twerkin'
Tight verses getting your blood, no hypodermic
I'm highly worshipped, puttin' clowns back inside the circus
Rap god, rocking Jordans in a wife beater
Might turn the beat, the beat down for sounding like Tina
They soundin' like divas with dyke features
I'm bed-rest ill, they barely a slight fever
Wordplay wizard, my mic is Harry Potter's wand
Czarface nominated at the Comicon, drop bombs
Deliver it hot like it's Papa John's poppin' dons
Burnin' blue flowers with Dr.Octagon
Phenomenon, John Travolta with the smoker
I'm straight like five sequence cards in poker
No sir, I am not a poser
My motto is bread over beef, you can call it Simosa


Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know you were going back to that. The reaper is saying the Devil gon' come after me. Well, I'm gonna kick his butt




Freddie, hey whats wrong with ya?
Oh no, gas!
Behold, the Armored One!


A grown ass man, mind from a trash can
And he kept his rhymes as aligned as a Tascam
Whoosh! Like a flash bang crash the Shazam Van
Made it with the stashed cash, and his black ash hand
Bring on the last man standing, he can hang
Did the Shang-A-Lang then caught him, Ka-Bang!
Drone flown pass, blam, ping on the dash cam
Known as a king who do rings on a mass scam
Overthrow a vast plan, shown a unmask fam'
Rock it like a sun's splash jam
She had the color, came first place on the can-can band stand
Face like Ann Landers, ask my man man-man
Bitter than a batch of tan bran from Pakistan
Don't get smacked with the practice hand
Not one to grand stand, get it on a low-low gram
Ampersand handstand gas can


For every super menace there seems to be, a super hero!
To rise in fearless challenge


I'm in the mosh pit, wilding with goth chicks
Fire, and desire, call it water for chocolate
The spark in the darkness, marvelous hard shit
Bump you off like a small part in a mob flick
Arson artist, tough customer to bargain with
No discussion, nor argument
No trust, no partnership
Respect, get me 'spect but the rest get hardship
My bars get funky like a playoff armpit
You living in your mom's crib, driving your broad's whip
I'm on it, strong grip holding my fork with
I'm on it, strong piff, floating my thoughts with
Nah I ain't feeling what y'all spit
All of 'em talk shit, call a coroner for this corpses
Warriors I walk with, all in the conflict
Live from the battlefield swords, and horses


Seconds later the villain was in the cockpit


Break out the fine china, tired of dining on a garbage rhymer
Quick on the draw like an art designer
Filthy like a carpet miner, masked men not from comic con
I'm hungry like Olajuwon, playing through Ramadan
Phenomenon, one stun gun for the unsung
Run run, 'fore I come undone and eat her lung lung
Um um, stuck in '95 like Rust Cohle, bust souls
Punch sneaker heads through their gum soles
Holding 'em, and folding 'em a tough soul controlling them
Emo rappers cry along like there's no Rust-Oleum
The flow is fire dog, no dalmatian, no salvation
Shall take place, this Czar with the Metal Face
Rebel based, mayday mayday
I'm out for that JJ Abram style pay day
I catch deer on foot, snatch eagles mid flight
Crashing through your skylight with Scott Summers eyesight


Easy Scott baby, don't lose control
Gotta' focus all my power, into one tiny beam
Hold steady, steady
If I can't blast through, I'll burn through!




I ain't trying to be no D-boy, I love music, I'm a b-boy
Are you the undercover or the decoy
I'm heavy with the D, Trouble T Roy
A pit with no muzzle about to bust your bubble like a keloid
Too much marijuana got me p-noid
I'm killing instrumentals with that All So Simple Can It Be, boy
Shout to Lil Cease, B.I.G., boy
And Funk Doctor Spock, I mean Redman that's not Leonard Nimoy
88 keys on the keyboard
I'm down to catch wreck, take them first three letters out of record
It's Meth, you heard it through the wire I could be more
Or washed up like Sonny Black's body on the seashore
That's a problem, I could be yours
A monster without the mad scientist and Igor
I've heard it before, a third of these boys
Got murder raps and never even murdered before


Keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
Keeping the streets locked
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
Keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
Run these streets out here don't need cops
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block


Codename Sensei, I live what my pen say
Game hall of fame, flow is MJ, Muy caliente
Je m'appelle Rebel, capisce, comprende?
Son I'm touching 'em up, trust I'm like
Justin Tuck how they ducking the rush
Tryna Break Bad, you catch a bad break
Like I own a bake shop how I stack cakes
Greatness was nothing, Deck the next Nike ad
Wifey bad and my life got 'em slightly mad
Cause I shine like chrome in July
Soldier I opened your eyes, notice the lies
DEA say I'm drugging 'em
I get you leaning hard, I get the fiends to nod, I mean they loving 'em
All hail your highness, terrific win
Put a so-called beast in his place, Pacific Rim


Keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
Keeping the streets locked
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
Keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
Run these streets out here don't need cops
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block


Foul ass police, crooked ass friends
I don't give a fuck yo, the drama never ends
I'm a project nigga, I don't care about the Benz
Plus I had a lot of chicks, you can have those bitches
But I murder your bloodclot if you touch my riches
Yeah crazy ass skipper, I be in the slums, nigga
Fuck where I come from I'm a quiet gangster nigga
First I get you comfortable, then I start shanking niggas
Park Hill code is don't violate the family
Brother to brother it's no snakes in the amnesty
I come through wilding on some Wu-Tang 'Can It Be'
Googly-eyed nigga, chop his face in the ministry
Never scared to do the time, fuck the penitentiary
Leave a bunch of dead niggas, don't forget to mention me
The angel of rap, the un-ordinary light
Already did what I was gonna do before you even got the mic


We left a large solar cloud distinguished by size
Interaction with the wise and civilized
The mind caused matter to fall into a center
A great deal of heat that'll radiate within ya
From out of this collision
The central cord became thick enough to trap its own light and bring vision
Each drop full of Hip Hop energy
Balanced on all sides such great symmetry
The bars unlocked the power of the stars
The mirror in the telescope pinpoint the Gods
From a distance, acting as a guiding coach
Analyze the board, universal approach
Retune the soul to a certain pitch
Changing the frequency frequently, hitting a certain switch
The love is paramount, the connect is brotherly
Respect for the intellect and broad discovery


Keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
Keeping the streets locked
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
Keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
Run these streets out here don't need cops
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block



Mommy... Daddy...
It's the Killa Beez....


You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious


Yo yo
I was born with this magnet, warned by the dragnet
About my dirty habits, I got to have it, the super-glow
Deuce Bigelow - Male Gigolo
Gold hands crush Coke cans and Michelobs
Style is Nino, black Benzito, Valentino
Nine needles - voice; evil steelo
Hit, like the bull, more pull than Magneto
Crush kilos with my bare hand, reload the Eagle
Nine dirty strikes, leaped up off all you people
Burn therapy, chemo, seap hoes
See you through the peephole - in the crime lab
Countin Ginos, cut-tin dime slabs
Then he bagged up Chino, rushed through the crowd with a hee-ho
Slapshots, jackpots, and pe-nnals
Throw graffiti on the wall, throwin up Reemo
Gambino three dice, headcrack Cee-Lo
In ya earhole, let the snare roll go low
Lower than low, lower than zero
Who's your rhymin heroes? *heavy breathing*
("Killa beeeeeeeeeeees?")


You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious


Bzzzz.. you hear the hornet, you ducks don't want it
I dogs blast turbo, supersonic
Hats off, welcome back, whipe the sweat off
Bobby Digital, half-man and half-cyborg
NY City, home of the fly bitties
With high-heel shoes and tattoos on side titties
Shorties swallow up the apple cider
Ra' doin a buck forty in the yellow Spyder
With the black interior, my mack superior
To your theory of gats, up in the cafeteria
I used to cut class and bang lunch tables
With four finger weaves and long chunky gold cables
Now I'm known to smack drum machines, carry +Guillotines+
Watch my bullets scream ("Pheeewwwwww!") and hit the target
You can't trace the path of air from which it started


You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious


It's the return of the bad boy, the mic Sean Penn
Floss gems across the globe with my nine Swordsmen
At a speed that excedes your convertible Benz
From a distance you glimpse, supernocular lens
Stay hotter than a ex-con dodgin the pens
Killa Squadron, known to start a popular trend
And the emblem, symbolize the wisdom
Certifies the platinum, magnifies the stardom
Shots bust at random, wake you out your boredom
Kings of our kingdom, reppin from our hoodlums
Gotta whip them problems, cuz yo we step on toes
Bangin heads knockin teeth loose, welcome to the pros
Flash quiz, do that nigga handle his biz?
I spin a song like Michael and Diana in the Wiz
The rough shit, I bust it for the republic
Government, you ain't lovin it, whatchu fuckin wit?
Manifesto, light it like a techno club
Outsiders don't expect no love
Man this grip, make the fans flip, don't chance it
Cop the goods, while my hundred hoods run rampid


You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious











*beat change*


I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when the pen hits tremendous
Ultra-violet shine blind forensics
I inspect view through the future see millennium
Killer Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets, Queen Bees ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block




They told me, what happened, alright
You're still young, and things like that always happen
When you'll learn, then you'll know not to make those mistakes


Really? These dudes don't want it with Deck, no, my set glow
Hate it or you love it, but you gonna respect though
You ain't got to know my name, check the blood, sweat & tears
For years, niggas know I bang
I'm a made nigga, caking what you call a boss
On my own two, never taking orders from ya'll
What I spit, get the corners involved, it's wreck on the yard
It's House Gang, son, it's more than hard
The life that'll glamour and glitz, best believe
On the flip side, nigga, it's them hammers and clips
Wanna live in high fashion and rich, so we scramble the strip
Camouflage, with they hand on the grip
Ain't nothing gon' stop kid from getting his due
No, your feets not big enough to fit in his shoe
I don't rock what you rap, niggas, they be pole
On 'The Wire,' just not HBO
They under fire, edge around the way we know
They know they time up, guess that's why they hate me so
But yo, they will never take me though, I had to go like
Montana, licking, sniffing crazy blow
Still I be Hard to Kill like Seagal
Warrior built, big shield and long sword
One Six Ooh'ing it, doing it, king size
Salutations, that's respecting the king eyes
For those that follow my lead, attract to the light
At the same time, marvel the speed
I'm so dope, I can bottle it free
The most influential, modern day murderous he


Yo, deep in the bungalo, chopping the motherload
Carving my own path, taking another road
I need a son to soul, he brought the troops with him
It sounds presidential, I got the truth serum
Don't want the booth near him, respect in the sabotage
I'm on the patio, stretched in my camouflage
And my grammar's hard, the Wolverine skeleton
I be the yellow man, snatching on the other brand
But on the other hand, light up the darkness
I'm stir fried, nigga, yeah, I'm heartless
My apartment is a hole in the wall, nigga
Pass me the rock, stop holding the ball
I told you before, under worser conditions
Chessboxing, nigga, mic's a dead body position


Aiyo, it's time to make cash dinero
I'm going to the Summer Jam concert to bash your hero
Lie up in your bedroom, smash your bureu
We looking for the money, man, pass the Euro
Apartment to pesos, pass the yen
And, we don't want to have to ask again
Cuz we ain't gon' be laughing then
These three men, take on your whole staff and win
Look, labels stay messing with a cat's future
And that weighs on me heavy like Rasputia
But I still keep spitting like a shortshop
I'mma be sitting at the table when the cork pop
You gon' be sitting at the table with a porkchop
Lacking on the beat like a short cop
It's your boy Ace, BK's own
All you ringtone rap dudes, please stay home, come on




Let me tell y'all all something motherfuckers
(Oh you complaining about that man?)
Yeah them motherfuckers belong to us
Straight up, tell all ya'll motherfucking hoes
Ya'll motherfuckers know what's the fucking time
You think we don't love you motherfuckers?
Run in to the motherfucking courts with all that bullshit motherfuka
I'm letting all ya'll motherfuckers know
I'm getting tired a that shit
You motherfucking triple breed motherfuckers
Bitches we love you motherfucka


Bobby Digi, Bob Digital shit is critical
Laid the fuck up inside the hospital
It's a riddle of a sphinx bitch had me jinx wid hijinx
Cuban linx snatched from my neck
It was the sex
This 12 ounce bottle of Beck's had me drunk
One night laid up wit the Ol' Dirt and ten bags of skunk
Just met this ho last month
Lookin' like a Benz with a woofer in the trunk
I pushed up like a push-up stick
One hand up near my cheek the other hand was holdin' my dick
I said "Power equal.. Boo!"
Where's your people? I be Bobby D-I-G-I-tal
(Is that right?) Word, and exact
Girl you got a smile that a make a nigga heart crack
(For real?) Word, ya grill like a thousand dollar bill
Close your eyes count to three and click you heels
And we could end up at my place face to face
Butt-naked I'll invade your inner space
*Sniff* Straight up boo
Damn I can taste it!
One drop of sperm the God wouldn't waste it
Over the quilt
I rather put it inside you so your breast be filled with milk
And we could lay up
And I could squeeze until it tilts
My house built on stilts is bangin' like the Hilton
Look, now how you feelin' gimme some feeback boo cause I need that
(Look Bobby where's the beer and the weed at?)
What girl? shit I got more than a little
She set me up for the kiss of the black widow


You couldn't get a flick of the hype outfit
Cause the way that I'mma dress this style is mad wild
Enough to make a crowd of women scream Oww!
Whether at a party or just in bed
Or thoughts of Ason bitch keep that in your head
My beats are funky my rhymes is funky
Sometimes I say well motherfucka what's the recipe?
I don't know! I ask my mama, she don't know!
Go ask ya poppa....
It's all about me in the place to be
Nigga you all that uhhh....
Motherfucka that shit is jinxed it's mad
Motherfucking game and it's a God-damn shame
How many motherfuckas wanna know this name, Ason
Yo I LOCK ON pass the break!
Shake and motivate, stimulate


By this wiz that you dying to have in your clutch
Fall in love like a drug
Call out into her love flood
Fuckin' so much, dunn you'll only bust blood
Caught inside the scud-missle grip like tissue
.....Now I'm laid up inside the hospital
Bobby Digital's on critical
Cause the testicles is drained

Huh huh
Nah I ain't doing it right, right?
Huh




Suga, come here, ayo man, tell ya man
He better bring that fucking money here tomorrow, man
You, walk up in the joint with me, man
It's all real, yo, what up son?
Yo, hold the bottle, it's your night, nigga!
It's your night!
Yeah, mad bottles! Playboy! We out of here, man
(Step inside, kiss the ring --- so salute, and toast to the best who done it)



When I step inside, kiss the ring, Wu Familia
La Cosa Nostra, it's our thing
So salute, and toast to the best who done it
Murder rap shit, I spit, for the vets who love it


By the time you read this letter
Your head gon' fly off your shoulder for lying
And I'mma be in bed like holders
Blood from a horse on your spread, you tried to play me now
I'm coughing up, dough on your head, you just a baby
See me in the flick in Zurich, I had to maybe with me
All these niggas stay in the 90's, getting rich
Rick Ruler robe on with rings, walking to the throne
Fronting like I know I'm the king, I live alone though
Buying up, China's Beemers, taking it to Simon's in Medina
Only just to blind you and leave ya
These young boys is crafted with aim, I bought 'em all
Fly ranches, cuz they all stand beside me with flames
Regardless, yo, to making the classic
You gon' witness some of the tactics
Some died, live in the action
A live general when he walk, if he died, then we slide
Ninety thou' in the coffin, and take the child


When I step inside, kiss the ring, Wu Familia
La Cosa Nostra, it's our thing
So salute, and toast to the best who done it
Murder rap shit, I spit, for the vets who love it


Black Jesus, check my walk, check my talk
Legend in the flesh and I rep New York
Crowned king, been down to bang, I'm House Gang
Knockout specialist, in and out the ring
Got dinner tables long as boats with old kitchens
And Wu-Tang logos splashed on all the dishes
You know how I speaks the truth, how I teach the youth
I'm an animal, I beast the booth
Been grinding, banging out for food to eat
Your boy still eating good, check my new physique
Since the world is mine, I'mma write my name on the clouds
So that ol' yee faithful, can praise it and bow


Now he's an old Mafia don, from back when
He managed to survive the game, ducking fame
It's how he maintained, the State of Grace, kept his lab laced
Ladies of a fine taste, kept his place guarded
While the young charted, found acquitted, all charges
And his heart loss and, marksmen take the contract
From the contact, waiting for the right event, it all made sense
He left no prints on the weapon, and he was blasting
Came home from prison stashing, still stacking
His whip still matching his kit, steel flashing
Hands quick, nice with his shit, three holy foods drops jewels
From a street corner level, young brother, I'mma rebel
Here to instruct private soldiers to buck arms
Ya'll rap cats had your last win, toast the kings
It's Wu-Tang, it's our thing, kiss the ring


When I step inside, kiss the ring, Wu Familia
La Cosa Nostra, it's our thing
So salute, and toast to the best who done it
Murder rap shit, I spit, for the vets who love it




Premo
What's good, I got you big homie
INS ya highness
(Now it's time to introduce...)


East side to west side, everybody set, ride
Beantown to S.I., they fiend for the next high
Lean with the red eye, mean with the MI
Rhyme sharper than the lightbeam on a jedi
Supreme, why test I?
Indeed, I rep mine
Agreed, minor leaguers fatigue, try next time
World War 4 whenever Deck rhyme
Physical grind, no subliminal, call me on direct line
Hens fly after next guy
I at best buy, shorty like "Let's ride"
Took me on a sex drive
NY creep, like Boz, Chilli and Left Eye
Don't sweat mine, move from the gate
Brothers respect mine
Cool with the broads (yes I'm)
Movin it hard (yes I'm)
Truest to do it, whoever dispute it, you wreck time
Yes I, leave your head twisted like a red tie
Deck amphetamines, they fiendin for the next line


I let it off, I let it off, I let it off...
Set it off...
I let it off, I let it off, I let it off...
Recognize the king, the livest thing


North side to south side, I'm a stay about my, biz
Fucking outcry, in while you outside
Vader make your brain fry
Greater than a Dane I
Take over your lane, I'm Dock Ellis when I aim high
Shame how ya abandoned a band and a witness stand and
Then randomly reprimand him, Esoteric is insane
I stay rope chain fly, pterodactyl hang glide
Bill O'Reilly, kill a grave, feel like you're the same guy
You like watching paint dry
Switch it up on dumb joints
I run point, I find, I motivate and let my sons voice
N'ahmean?
Are you the youngest on the track of Preme
Tractor beam rap regime, AOTP, that's the team
I Reggie Lewis from the key, solidify the sucker free
Critics pretty much agree this shit is gutter luxury
This is Skywalker fam, Jack Kirby free hand
7 let them cuts ride




Come here, spin it back
I'm in it in a minute flat
Dissed cats love it, and they ain't even into rap
Rhymes on ya mind like a fitted cap
What I spit is crack
Salutations, see him, tip your hat
Man, he been a mac, he ain't gotta ask where the bitches at
Picture that: thick chicks sittin in his lap
He a diplomat, VIP status and he strip em at
Alien flow, gettin visits from the men in black


Anybody want it they can get it
Call the medevac, transporter, manslaughter
You don't want to set it, Jack
Vet'll clack, you won't even leave with your head attached
Back pedal and pedal back, these rap rebels will turn you to scrap
Metal and burn up your back
Revel in the fact, when devils attack
We live with the flack, with the powerful lines
Shit on your hood like a feral cat
I'm out of my mind

YoyoyoyoyoYO! Yo
Is the niggas ready for this son?
Niggas ain't ready for this ock
One two whatcha wanna do (I'm gonna give it to em anyway though man)
Peep the Inspectah Deck (You know they ain't ready for it)
Lyrical threat
Representing Wu-Tang
Slang, ninety-five
Hittin it live
You know what time it is

Blessed with the art rhymes that's sharp like a circular saw
Hit the floor like Dorf, who wants the war
None slide by my, lyrical driveby
Shots bust, making blocks huss
Plus snipe the cops when they rush
Built like construction tools
Crushing fools, in twos
Forced you to blast out your fuckin shoes
A South swap with the bombs I drop
Plan A to terrorize you can't stop the plot
Execution of an amateur, who dares to challenge a
Clansman, holding a sword like Excalibur
Truth is my shield, show and prove I reveal
Reality, the coldness a heart can feel
Livin life where caps peel, and crack deals from nine to five
But I survived through these live times I nearly died
Now I'm wanted by death I did escape
Now it's thrown on a tape for those who can relate
Still I wrap my face take a space in the staircase
Hits takin place, yo God, watch the Jakes
Out of state court dates, chase me with the warrants
For my insurance, switched names to Michael Lawrence
The Rebel, stomps through the slums I'm from
Coming through with nuff niggas, and nuff guns to bust son
So read the article, lyrical assassin with the arsenal
Potential witnesses are incapable
Of testifying, they want me frying in the chair
Plus the case closed, I broke free of the shackles, and safe clothes
I make foes, exasperate them, I make friends
Cause today's friends, show theyselves as snakes in the end
And if you fit the trend then Protect Ya Neck
Shaolin, INS, Killa Hill Projects

No one on this earth, can hold me
No one on this earth, can fool me
No one on this earth, can grip the mic
Like, I, do, nigga

You ever, feel, that you can
Test me, you got to face the Clan and
Never, return to the mic again
There's no one in the world

Let me at them! I blast off lyrics like a Magnum
Forty-four caliber, bustin mad holes in my challenger
Turning your trunk to swiss cheese
The wild freestyler, wild like Gene Wilder
Wu-Tang killa bee aimed at your brain
With my stinger, it stun your mind, when I bring ya
Thirty-six chambers of anger, frustration
For waiting, to let loose on the nation
Far from commercial no need for no rehearsal
Hit you from all angles then form a circle
Go against the grain, get hit close range
When I Slam, like Onyx, comp get stomped, that's a promise
I'll represent, here's the evidence
Science of math on a plate to make sense
My technique of speech is deep, like Leviathan
Hittin up your block with rhymes, weapon firing
Shooting for the platinum, then bring it back to
The same place I got the gat from, let me at them!




Someday I'm gonna be walkin down the streets
Mindin my own business.. and BAM!!
I'm gon' be shot by some pig who's gonna SWEAR
That it was a mistake
I accept that as a part of my destiny!




Whattup kid? That's right..
Yo.. aiyyo.. aiyyo..


Aiyyo let my niggas live
We show and prove get paper, catch me in the caper on shrooms yo
Let my niggas live
We real niggas that's God-body, challenge anything, make major moves
Let my niggas live
We giants, live off the land lions, post with iron, no pryin rules
Let my niggas live; aiyyo let my niggas live
Handle your bid and kill no kids


Millionaire feat, whole family eat; yo, y'all niggas is weak
Got a bird beak, chirp chirp speak
Kids that's rich that'll, run in your bitch and by the third week
Yo mark my word, me and my herb speak
That's that fire move like Schwinns yo
Invisible pens that write light, leave blends
Hit with the JF Kennedy shot
Smash with the Acapulco rifle got got
Bolt off, but got clocked
Legendary here, custom made it, shit bladed, word up
Design your alphabet, reps get graded
We in get-high saloons, big bag of shrooms, arm's length
Home of Allah's ten big rooms
So what we up in here, modelin large with rigorous moves
Exotic Gods bust my hammer at frauds
Call him a live merchant, dressed in all red, that's right y'all
Gucci jumper X-5, gettin more head




I scream at the mirror, curse, askin God, "Why me?"
Run in the black church, gun in my hand, y'all try me
I'm God-son, son of man, son of Marcus Garvey
Rastafari irie, Ha-ile Selassie
Police'll try to break us, but the streets raised us
It takes more than metal bars, we destined for ours
I hear murder plans from dopefiends, with elephant hands
Snots in they nostril, the blocks is hostile
There's no pots to piss in, Glocks is spittin
Rocks cookin underground bodies stiffin, cops look at bird shit
Drop on the window pane, the oxygen is cocaine
It drove lots of men to die with no name
I been on boats, nut down throats, pee on bitches who famous
Pretty dick, puttin stitches in they anus
I'm the animal that Hugh Heffner created
The only nigga Sade dated, the most hated, Nas nigga




Roughneck reppin the set, bang 'em twice in the neck
C.O. flip and jerk the whole yard rec
Block vets, pop barettas Glocks and tecs
You're no threat, gun talk, the language of the project
Checkin shorty with the +Black Tail+ stance, leapord pants
Yellin fuck her man, makin killings off her lap dance
Plus the young guns runnin the slums, funds is major
Drugged out, got you huntin for crumbs stuck to the razor
Semi-autos roar in the building hall
Symptoms of bloodsport, the slugs are still in wall
Call it a New York state of mind, gotta take mine
In the daytime, the Jakes'll hit ya forty-one times
So I live by the sword and obey hood laws
Make my team click like high heels on wood floors





And moments later

Level Electric 1



 + (Raekwon)
(Yeah, yeah) Aiyo, how much more for a fifth of Vodka? (Peace beloved)
(Six bottles of Henny, six bottles of Henn) Word, word, let me get that
Herb, yeah, yeah.. (bring that bucket here)
Yeah (get some ice, man, two more bottles of Cru', man, word up)


I've gone through life pretending
That time will change the ending


Peace to the God (peace God) pour out a little liquor
Shame On A Nigga, I heard the reaper done came to get ya
So I done copped a fifth of, Vodka, and in your honor
I've grown this fetish for loose ladies and baby mommas
Some say it's bad karma, what you do, man, it come back on ya
Music got us up off them crack corners
Now I'mma swallow this whole bottle for Ol' Dirty
Damn, it hurts me, I hate it when brothers go early




Word to my son, he gon' remember you, rubbing on a statue
In his lab, that resemble you, and what it meant to Wu
Us forming like a family, you just blew
You was the chess piece on the board, that made us look true
Watching your pen swish, you love frying kingfish
You the pearl in the ocean, I'm up on the land, pissed
Now you moving more prestigious, me, hitting this reefer
I know it's real, guess I slept with the Black Jesus




I became weak when I heard, that his body expired
It was hard for me to believe my brother retired
Suddenly the clock stopped and the room started spinning
How can he walk off the field during the first inning?
I cried like a baby on the way to his place of death
Hate not being there, the minutes before he left
Now I'm in the booth, ten feet from where he lay dead
I think about him on this song and what he might've said




When I first heard the word, I needed air to clear my head
I know you didn't say what I thought you said, my brother's dead
You crazy, another Dirty prank to get the family cranked
Ya'll niggas shouldn't play like that, I know how you feel
Lord, but it's real, and I still can't believe
And my heart still grieves the loss, there's no pretending
Ason Unique, loved wine and fine women
We singing on tour, "ooh baby, we like it raw"




Can't pretend...
Some day it gotta come to an end
But I'mma keep you right here dog, real close to my heart
Yeah...


I popped a bottle on your born day, God
Tried hard not to cry, I still can't hide the scar
And I still ask, why to God, analyzing your form
As I stood there beside your mom
And I share the blame, cuz you was calling for help, kid
Should've, would've, could've, had the time, I was selfish
I carry on your struggle, each day it really hurts me
I really miss you Russell, hope you forgive me Dirty




Yo, these walls I wanna crash, and put my fists through
Shout out to Dirty, let the whole world miss you
Reach out and kiss you in your coffin, my heart races
I dropped tears and watch my nigga fall from greatness
It's all wasted, flushed down the drain and
Soon as the news hit me, I bust out with pain and
Rivers I cried, my brother just died
I'mma see you, my nigga, on the other side




Ah, man, how do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones that have to die
It's hard to live without you, God, I shouldn't have doubted you
When you said that The Passion of Christ was all about you
From the God Mobile, to Linden Plaza, to Brownsville
Florida to Ohio, to Putnam, to Park Hill
You interrupt the Grammy's said "Wu for the kids"
Took four or five shots when they rushed in the crib
Trey-five-seven cracked ya ribs, cops shot ya whip
You've been chased by the pigs, sold the four year bid
Crashed cars, still came out without a scar
They tried to keep ya free spirit trapped in a jar
So you'll keep ya mouth shut, and not tell the world
Who's who and what's what, and probably go nuts
How we treat them hoes? Dirt, how we treat them hoes?
We fuck 'em in the butt, Dirt




But those mistakes behind me
Cast shadows to remind me

*gong bangs*
*Sifu Shi Yin Ming reciting the Heart Sutra*




Uh, yea
In my time, I've seen a lot of people come and go
A lot of new faces, been to a lot of new places
Wherever we went, we always held it down
While we conquered new grounds. It's a universal sound
The Witty Unpredictable Talent And Natural Game
Yo...


Not many last in the game
Wu-Tang come through, breakin out the same way we came
This is not an act, this is actual facts
Nothin but experience placed upon the tracks


We stand perpendicular with no flaws
Breakin all laws, plus jaws, the writin's on the walls
Heartless, starvin artists, out to get our's
Regardless, marvelous doctrines, we shock this
Fist of the black lotus, bustin out the steel cage
Iron Mic Duel made the front page
Outlaws, out for your's, get down on all fours
Rebel with a cause, without applause to the score
"Pillagin" with Donna-Cap, this persona raps
Hittin like a cornerback, blitzin' on the track
Fully-auto, got the mic blow, strike low
High-caliber flow move the crowd, twist your torso
2009, block party, Bobby Digital, pop corks to us
And the God's we trust, adjust
To the highs that we bring with the lows
In the midst of hell speakin out in morse code
Runnin wild like dogs out the kennel through the venue
Simple chemistry, vitamins plus the minerals
Organic vowels, consonants, syllables
Condition critical, ill individual
Paint a picture too vivid for the visual
Material rips through to the gristle




Yo, the messages in my music grab you, stuck in my sentence
Got to spit from the bottomless pit, speakin my vengeance
Masked avenger never surrender my heritage
Killah Hill resident, 5'10" be my measurement
On land we stand under flags as confederates
You think you rule, pity the fool when the shell drops, it's hot
Bodies scream to the extreme, damn, I'm delicate
We livin irrelevant, intelligent, dirty habit
They full of fragments, abandon all 10 commandments
Damage is done as the records spins, hatred in my features
Untamed, thus these cold blooded creatures bust
Architect gladiator radiates the power
Erupt with corrupt minds, locked in the tower
The crook's pressure cooked invasion be destroyed
Self-employed paranoid androids


My rhyme cold winds clear streets and slams shutters
Basic Instinct to tear the roof off the mother
Drastic verbal gymnastics, far from the average
Hold the planet like Galactus
Lone Ranger, ancestors rolled with stone bangers
Never met a force deadly as my own anger
Clutch performer, raised on the blood soaked corners
Of real life with real trife heads, they prey on ya
And not many last on the game
Whether it be lies, fly songs or drugs you slang
In the beginnin, it didn't come fast amongst the gun blast
Strivin, my eyes on lump sums of cash
Cash Rules Everything Around Me, surroundin me with champagne wishes
But I see long distance, a strong vision planted deep within the mental
Mind detect mind and analyze what I sent you






What is love? Love is love
What is love? (Loving you)


Yo, examinin her hour-glass frame
Exotic name, passion, splashin the fly fashions
On the 2 train, words soothin her brain
There's the cue, cross the platform, she 'bout to exchange
She wooed slowly in plannin a kiss
And in the same motion, bounced off with the switch
Couldn't let here go, before the train pulled off
She gave me a look that described my thoughts
And I was hypnotized by her ebony eyes
She wised to my scheme, made her temperature rise
Hours later, still zonin off the moment
Happened so fast, it's over with
And now you're gone, like the same short time
But stay so heavy on my mind, I'm...

"Loving you"


Yo, I met a bad chick, model actress
Soft as a mattress, said she was catholic
Physically attractive, earth-toned skin
Thick but thin, looked like she just came off an island
Rolled in Porsches, lady was gorgeous
I'm tryin to ram bar down her mental fortress
Loved my name, La song, how'd you like to have my 4th born?
I'm the God, I'll be your umbrella in a storm
We can smoke, parlay, see a ghetto matinee
Don't worry about me, young thug, cuz I'll stay...

"Loving you"


Dana was a girl I knew, she was true
Twist L's with the crew, bust the gat too
Had the stash labbed for when the jake rushed
'nuff head to grab, razors in bags
Lettin me rest my head, wild fugitive
Acceptin all collect calls throughout the bid
Like a big sister, I've got major love
She waved my hair, plus hold a gun in the glove
While you girls move like slippery eels
You the diamond in the rough that been keepin it real
That's why you're closer to me than most I roll with
Smoked bones, rolled dice and made dough with
And now you're gone like the same short time
But stay so heavy on my mind, I'm...

"Loving you" (x2)




We still don't care, anytime anywhere
Oh lovely,lovely,lovely blood
And now, the world tag-team champions!


Cock back the hammer, watch me lay them down
Czarface the villians, we don't play around
Nobody make a sound, so now the battle is on
Grab your woman and children and get to safer ground
The king stun like the Jamaican town
Futuristic flow, Darth start with a laser sound
Leaving nothing but a vapor trail
And my bass, heavyweight, no shake, I'mma break the scale


Inspector, we have followed your instructions to the lettering


Let me just cut to the chase, you are a bucket of waste
I make producted a pace, Barry Allen when I race
You can scuff the J's up, but you do not fuck with the face
You can get dumped in a lake
Besides double D's I don't really fuck with nothing that's fake
I show up drunk in your way
Looking for something to break, bumping to Geto Boys, take
Mind over lunatic, nuclear Ryan doo doo is you the dick
Click, got my mutant plus a student of this shit


Oh this that next Czarface shit, right?
(Si, senor)


Fear me coming like Ndamukong Suh
Bottom line I'm a problem for dudes, it's not an option to lose
I'm shining, I'm blinding, it's like I'm rocking jewels
Czar too, keep it funky like a locker room
The flow universal, I'm Doctor Who
Soul seeker I goes deeper than Popa Wu
Hundred thou, going wild, let the Bonnaroo
Wu-Tang forever, you just stopping through


Ok,let's go. O,ok let's go


Y'all don't want any of this
Score without any assists
Sound boogie down like the brothers, Kenny and Kris
Get a better serve, your dream has been deferred
That ain't gods path, you a pet that occurred
Rappers wanna kill me but that shit hasn't yet occurred
My rhymes are lazy, border collie, shit you never heard
Shit you might not even get, no you can't even see a set
Never spot me on the bench, but I got a lethal rep
Yo,Deck


Can't see us man
(Tell 'em!)


Fucking with the three, you ain't moving wise
Call it lambo doors, that's suicide
I put cats to sleep, leave 'em euthanized
Skull Mountain king, no amusement ride
Foolish pride, the reason for you to scrutinize
You can hide but I still see through disguise
On a hookah high, INS too super fly
Bring fire to your camp like kumbaya
Kumbaya


The Czarface mission, make seven figures
Like a super suck lord, limited edition
Listen, my brain sci-fi
You try and test it I'll pass with flying colors
Like a gangbang drive-by
I maintain my fly side, cultivate my grimy one
You can call for help, but you'll be dead by 9 1
How we body 'em Rebel?
Like a broken elevator, wrong on so many levels


As he sits eachd ay at his board along with his characters
It's what's inside the mind that counts
If you look at my characters you'll find me. No matter what
Kind of character you create a little of yourself
Must remain there




Ay, what's up baby?
I need you to sit down for a minute, relax your feet
I'll keep an eye on the dinner
Something I've been wanting to say for a minute
So just listen


I'm just sitting here, pouring my heart, even though
Usually, about now, I be touring with the Gods
Play your status like I'm MJ, scoring with the broads
My love for you is deep, a little more than what's it's called
So how am I at fault, we both got issues
I miss you on the road, but at home I fight with you
At times I might be tight with you, take my life before I hit you
Situation difficult to get through
You was just concerned with all the bitches in the face
I was just concerned with all the riches in my face
Grown man, so these bitches know they place
I know it's no love, cuz yo, they fucking different niggas every day
Couldn't wait to hit the crib and see your face
If only for one night, the sunlight's gleamin' in our face
No love without pain, I still love you the same
But still share the same love for the game, and so


Baby, I just got your love letter
I'm trying to do better, 'cause now I know better
I'm gonna hold you down, I'm gon' stay strong
You gave me your word, so I ain't gonna do you wrong


There be days when you call him on stage, text messaging
All in a rage, you think I'm fooling around
But the truth is, I'm moving around, L.A
Yesterday to the Bay, next stop Chi-Town
Rarely get a chance to lie down, snatching paper with the fly sound
All the hoes, you are not down
When the going got rough, you ain't jump up and leave
But if you did, wouldn't be so tough to believe
Cuz I know I put you through it, woman like you
You just trooped it, girlfriends calling you foolish
Hang on in there girl, cuz when I"m finished
We gonna live it to the limit, I'mma give you the world
Just saying that it's you on my mind, I wish I was there
But I gotta stay true to my grind
Coast to coast line, strolling the curve
Kiss the kids for me, baby, I be home on the third




You told me stay off the block
But still held me down when a nigga got locked, yeah
You brought me clean drawers and socks
On the dance floor tried to sneak in some top
It's like my pen be the heart, ink be the blood
I know your mama pissed that you fell for a thug
I can't wait to give you kisses and hugs just to be right near you
Wishing I was, missing your love
So close, but it's so much distance between us
So I call collect, long distance, hoping you pick up
Yeah, I know the Gods try to holla
But I'm that nigga, still touch the world getting dollars
Just ride with me, mama, release date soon
Said I'd probably touch the streets around the middle of June
Can't wait to get you undressed, P.S. sincerely yours
Always, mama, love, Fes, yeah





Yeah
You know what the fuck it is nigga
Machine nigga
Czarface nigga
Yo, Uh, Uh
Look (look) Look (Look)




Catch you at the red light (nigga)
Pop you in the head twice
In the hood playing cee-lo with the red dice (look)
Free my nigga doing fed life
Cross the mall get your shin broke
Factory rims on the ten spoke
We all eating none of my friends broke
Fuckboy get outta pocket Mac-10 smoke (look)
Sell the drop let the brick fly
Whip it, sit it on a napkin let the shit dry
Remember spraying up the block while my bitch dry
My youngin my killer is it my bitch aye
East side nigga we don't let shit slide
If we cant get to you then your bitch die
Niggas know how I do it
Go head play stupid pussy nigga you gon leak fluid


Well I get it I say
Yeah turn me up some
Well I get it I say
In another part of the city at that certain brownstone we find



I take that pistol they holding
Put that shit to they dome and
Look at this as the norm and
You hear that click now get going
When that pictures in motion
You feel that sinister joke and
You think I resurrect the Heath then hire Christopher Nolan
I just keep the whip clean like an Uber driver
Rappers fall back like a SCUBA diver
Who's live-r, Larry when I talk trash
Walk away finger up drained it off glass
Class is in session, peasants kneel
Heavy record got the feel of the seventh seal
Heavy sketch like a Bill Sienkiewicz steel
Heavy swing like Jackie on Ebbets Field
Used to ride flow had a low sale
Flipped for the children on my coattails
Bars locked it down like theres no bail
My words make a mark like I wrote braille


(Record scratching)
Well I get it II say
Turn me up some
Yeah
Meanwhile a few blocks away



They say you dont love it
If you cant leave it in a heart beat
Cash is king Im snatching everything in arms reach
Pardon me, yall in my way
Say its all about the Benjamins and women friends
Call it a day
Its the feeling like the best sex ever
Roll your eyes back
Moment you come down to earth you need that high back
I been there, rainy days, eighth of the haze
Ran the route, caught the ball, that the play of the game
See my young g's falling trying to play it the same
Get money, catch a body how you making your name
Shame
Loyalty is for those who did the bid with me
Take care of my wife and my kids if, they dare get me
Models and bottles on the wake up
Straight face, no makeup
I catch back pains holding my weight up, straight up
Put them on hold cause the paper calling
Full time with the grind keep a hater talking



Well I get it I say
Yeah, yeah yeah
Wassup
This is what it is like (yeah, alright)




Damn you security, I ain't waiting in line
Look, who that nigga, ya'll let that nigga right through, right?
Man, fuck that... aiyo, H.G.'z, U.D.Z's to the front
Yo, yeah...


Fuck a guest list, nigga, it's me
6'3, with that lean, popping bottles of P., puffin' exotic trees
Crew thing, keep my women in threes
And I roll with the House Gang, quick on the squeeze
Bottom line, I'm a sick disease, in this cold world, I'm Mr. Freeze
And I'm swift with ease, and I'm not gonna tell you twice
Ya'll gon' fuck around and have a nigga locked in the cell for life
I'm putting fire to your ass, see me slide past
In the latest shit, with six tigers on the dash
I got money on my mind, trapped in this wilderness
I'm running out of time, rise if you feeling this
My life's on the line, never chat with feds
Keep a knife or a nine, gotta scrap with bread
The rude boy been clapped the lead, we the dice on the sidewalk
Score points, and crack your head
Got the blueberry sacks from dred, and your boy stay
Black home from the hat and threads
Cuz been around the world, and back to my corner crew
H.G.'z, U.D.Z, now what you wanna do?


Make a move, say something, yeah
Make a move, say something, yeah
Make a move, say something, yeah
Make a move, say something, yeah


See I, freak the streets, straight murder the track
I'm a beast from the east, got fur on my back
Won't hesitate to crawl or scratch, you gotta feed me
My CD flying off the rack
From the Bricks out in Jersey, through the Mid-West
To Dirty Dirty, the kid's definetly thirsty
My loc's on the West Coast, them fools is real
Got the volume up, gliding on, just two wheels
I bust rhymes, crack your necks to lead, yeah Deck's a threat
I rip your best rapper, rep to shreds
We the bout it, front page of The Source
Wanna pose like you gangsta boss, don't wanna face the boss
Take your Superman cape off, blame your soft
I caked off, like a bake off, then break North
I got, strength in the street, code name: Radiator
Big in the heat, no games, gladiator
Rest in the beat, too deep to breathe
Wu is nine wisemen who speak degrees
Make 'em weak in the knees like S.W.V
Been try'nna hold a title like Wu Killa Bee, man...





* originally on the "Tape Proprietors" Tash bonus disc

Verse One:  ?

Yo we ice, you gold (uh-huh), we the dicks, you the pussy hole
Move your eyes if you're Whoopi Gold-
The game's over, lame soldier
Got my '99 Dana Dane froze on ya dame's poster
Once again, peon, I puff-puff the marijuan, nothin' beyond
No coke, no her-on, ya dead wrong
Tryna match the Don of all Dons with ya double bronze
Money replenish, cook crack like a chemist, nigga yap?
Twist his cap back like a gymnast
I'm sick, worse than syphilis
I smack niggas on the wall, lookin' inconspicuous
Pops wasn't shit, I was bred to be nigga-ish
Record deal route, to make bitches bounce
If they don't, take me Uptown to cop an ounce
I walk around with down payment for a house
On my neck alone, I'm the Down South cousin on ya wifey's phone
Break ya Bone, Thug and move in Harmony
The choice is yours, it don't bother me
Roosevelt 'til I'm dust, I.G.T

Chorus:  ?

What ch'all wanna do, make money?  Or make cents
But it makes sense to make money, and stay bent
What ch'all wanna do, make money?  Or make cents
But it makes sense to make money, and stay bent

Verse Two:  ?  (O.T.?)

We could blast it out of orbit like a space shuttle, dust you
Off in ya huddle, 38 Specials make wet puddles when they bust you
A sick sight for sore eyes might disgust you
Loud sounds make cassettes settle when they hear it
Like a scratched needle
O.T. is that evil, I slap people, who act feeble, and not meager
Don't measure up, y'act too eager
But not to leave ya, we got true beef
Like tarryin' the beat with duel heatas
Take on forms like amoebas, a true character
Actin' out scenes, like Drew Barrymore
Before we got warrior, you had to have it, now ya don't want it
No more, at all, what's wrong wit'cha?
I'm gone, so long nigga, it's on critter, let's get it on
Word is bond, nigga

Chorus

Verse Three:  Inspectah Deck

Deep in the lobby, fiend clockin' me for my stash
Dirty cop passed, flashin' the Glock, he's stoppin' Kash
We grabbed the mask and act fools, pack tools to crash crews
Brand-new niggas get used, for Cash Rules
Chameleons blend, expose theyself in the end
Risk they life before thinkin' twice, dyin' ta get in
Tha circle, new society, those that die for me
I.N.S, I.G.T., my heir lights a sodomy
The hunger burns fiery, I'm still wide-eyed from the last high
Catchin' visions five-times magnified
I spit grammar, lickin' like a twin-hammer
To snatch the fame and the wealth, without the glitz nor the glamour
Kill the cameras, and all with this act of murda
This cat pack a burna, take ya head off, like Nat Turner
The war's on, the block ain't safe for you to walk on
With new bloodstains, the battleground we just fall-ed on
Sign of the times, I'm on a mission to eat right
Creepin' at night (yo, yo)
Livin' after street life

Verse Four:  ?

I'm high energy, low maintenance, born atheist
Wrapped in a towel with some Avias
Black patriot, computeristic, I spit hot rhymes consistent
Leak liquid, combined with the same substance
That cyanide is mixed with
On every gem I flow different, go the distance
Speak persistent, burn incense, meditate, strange mindstate
Put it down, with the PaperMate
Pen and a pad, that's how I operate, we the total opposite
With the same opportunities, same enemies
Streak forth from my brain, forms a trinity
Without ?Clee? we a trilogy, break me down and re-assemble me
This is my assembly, I go hard, with the gift that God has given me
The cry, into the night has risen me
I'm the epitome, of bein' lyrically
Come closer if you ain't hearin' me
It's impossible to mimic me--stick a nozzle in my neck
Turn it on and empty me, empty me
(Fake fuck!)

Chorus




Yo 7L, yo Es man, y'all niggas ready?
I'm back at it man
Mad scientist flow
In the laboratory on some Frankenrhyme shit
Bring shit to life on 'em


Call me your worst nightmare
Watch the birds take flight, take life, every verse I air
Guaranteed I deliver it hot (like what?)
Domino's, feet up, chilin' in your spot, vmonos


Meaning leave, beat it, you can see that he's heated
And the E-S feel the same, that's why we remain seated
Keep the lab dusty like the day after D-Day
Spiders die of old age here, and three stay


Raw like Columbian white
Stay buzzin', hey cousin, they ain't nothin', all my numbers is right
Red dragon from the dungeon of rap
Dark flames set free, truthfully


these emcees are lame, and they should be illegal
Like buckin' at a bald eagle
I've got the ego of Evel Knievel, you weak and feeble
I'm Beanie Sigel if he was one of the Beatles
And possessed the DNA of Magneto
So fuck, fuck your people




It's Eddie Brock, I'm Peter Parker, and
We can rock black until they make something darker, and
We back to building inside the Baxter Building
Private location, dykes, no hibernation
No Michael Myers or Jason


your highness the great one
Took the heads off the livest of brave ones
Lord of the Underground, dumbing them out
With a crowd of a hundred thou, bow to the sound
The Archangels sing, the God's name will ring
Frontliners upon us, we're made of king
INS do it to death, like the rudest exec
Who's next, who's foolish to test?


Who's stupid? And 'fess
Stand back and Google it, yes
If opportunity presents we commin' through to your rest
Beautiful mess, tool to your chest
This a Marvel team-up, who would've guessed?
Ah, not you - you don't know
Not you, either
(Just a spark, though)
(Just a spark, though)




(Aiyo, Chef?) What up, my nigga?
(Yeah, man, I gotta give you the 411, shit is straight 911, word)
It's $2.50, nigga, back the fuck up! Talk to me...
(Word, them blue ninjas is everywhere
Word, watch ya back, Protect Ya Neck and all that shit, man
Thirty nine motherfuckers already got scooped up
Indicted, word, I'm bird eye viewing it right now
Out there out the motherfucking window)
You got the strong scoopers out there?
(Word, five book store buses out front
All them young boys are certified, they ain't rentals)


Run these mean streets from Cali to New York
Who could ya trust? Niggas they do talk
Running from the feds and out of state troopers
Look up ahead, you know we got sharp shooters


The blocks is molded, step up ya sword piece
Moving through them housing with more ki's
Rembrandts is fresh from Scotland, crisp hats, Cristal bottles
Niggas want the problems, we back
It's time to take over the game, it's nothing
I live on the line, from corner to castles with pawns and capsules
Scramble and find, my money's up, I'm praying for war
I do this all the time, all the time, all the time
Faces of Doom, sling in the lobby
Swinging cooked raw, if you played the field you was not leaving
Fast-pacin' for CREAM chasing team
Trying to come through the hood and lie, get left for dead naked in Queens
Let them other niggas wear that, we take the credit
While we was shopping for more Nikes and off-whites
Heroin stirrers, the crib, cracked mirrors
Career thugs who serve only judges and jurors
Got to make my money this year, whether it's through rhyming or criming
I'll be on the line with my iron
Promised them llamas'll fly fast, quick at pirahnas
Trying to intervene, get caught dead, no head in pajamas
You live like a slouch from vouchers
Nobody mad, you was a fake, dead, die with no trousers
Cause you crossed the line like Miller's Crossing
Off with ya dome, I walked you through the woods, we both smoked a bone




Mean streets...
Just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in
The streets stay flooded with crack rocks and Mac shots
The scenery's money, guerrillas in the back drop
The livest'll pop, the weakest get chopped where they stand
Singing the judge's name, dropped in the stand
Drug money kills, blood on my bills, mud on my Nikes
Only buying with the couple that I trust with my life
Twenty four sev' ducking the feds, infrared wtih lead
Gamble with off track betting instead
In my hood anybody can get it, and everybody want it
Cutthroat executives, the corners, the office
And the thought is to be boss of all bosses
The cost is ya life, swimming with sharks and orcas
So keep ya guards up, or get scarred up
It's a Cold World, I told you with Allah Just'
The bigger the funds, the bigger the guns that's blazing
It's sick in the slums and niggas are stunting for nathin'


Aiyo, my gun been in more niggas mouths than a whore had dick
With creamy nuts on the side of her jaw
It's Rigatone, nigga, sliding through airports
Riding on niggas like MJ, same day I rocked you, comprende?
Yeah, I'm kinda off cuz my guns was dirty
That last joint that hit you, kid, you made the top thirty
Early, walk with me and strap with a vengeance
More or less Ghostface Killah'll stretch you out like mad words in a sentence
Smell the gas burning (yeah) feel the fire (word)
Real talk, it's not that bullshit from The Wire
It's them disco kids that clap iron
Champion hoods, if ya coke don't freeze, my face is not worth frying
We crack eightballs with pool sticks
Bungee jump off a mountain of bricks
Fuck you up if you slinging those nicks
Toney Starks from the octagon, my ox is on
Snap Matt Hughes' neck with my boxers on





 (x2)
If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome


The whole world trippin', listen it's still a cold world
The other day I had to bury my homegirl
Wrong place, caught one in her face
Plus her man's on the run and couldn't come to the wake
For Heaven's sake, you pray God open the gate
In this modern day Sodom, that's their only escape
10 year olds are cold, no, they don't hesitate
2 up a G pack, he chose the whole 8
Catch a 5 to 10 sellin' 5's and 10's
And the police informer was your childhood friend
In the real world, gotta hustle for your dream
Extend your clips, fit the muzzle with the beam
For the love of cream, it's nothin' but routine
Swing on the judge, take a couple for the team
He's the young Capone, he grew up in a drug home
Stranded on the Ave with a blunt and his gun shown


If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome


A live scene theme from a Godfather saga
A Martin Scorsese classic and I'm the author
Drama at the opera, crime story novel
Tuxedo suit and silencer on the nozzle
Meeting place scheduled at the Broadway musical
Bravo, we arrive in bulletproof limo
Shotgun, the underboss of our main source
Of interest, the black widow cocaine empress
A princess rich from her family's inheritance
Now let's talk business, begin by addressin' the bricks
That was missin' in the last shipment
At first, everything nice, everything routine
Jocks lining up the food, we blessed him with the cream
But on this day he wasn't ready and my God sense keen
I noticed that his normal firm handshake shook
It wasn't steady when he squeezed


If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome


He went from prince to a king out of a life of rubbish
Wearin' tailor-made suits, Sky Dwellers and clusters
To perfection, rags to riches, the evil's done influenced
That pushed him off the edge, they said the greed made him do it
You're my right hand, damn, he fucked the trust up
It's ruined, niggas caught him slidin' on his belly
I'm grippin' on my hammer with the silencer twisted
Contemplatin' murder now, I'm 'bout to swerve on my biscuit
But it's my man at the same time, I don't wanna do him
He violated, broke a major code, bar what you stealin' now
It's over, in the falls of Niagara, he was soakin'
With a shell case stuck in his head, they found him floatin'


If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome


Allah let me lay in your arms
Hold me like a newborn
Sing to me the most sweetest song
The exalted, the most benevolent
The knower of all
Keep me safe 'till I return back to your residence
This Earth, my place of birth
As time went through the ages it got worse
Sicknesses, beheadings in Syria
Ebola's killin' my people, it's gettin' scarier
Most foods ain't even real, the chip is here
Deadly fluids bein' released, contracted through air
Dear God, it been a minute since I cried out
Since mama died, I never wild out
We need help like the phone's 'bout to die out
Can you hear me? Can you hear me now?
We need a miracle
Destroy the FDA for holdin' back cures
So they can get paid


If a miracle could save us from
The travesty that we've become
If a million sons would stand as one
We will overcome, overcome




Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home and see my wife and kids
I wanna go home


Yeah yeah they want me locked down, fryin' in jail
Before you hear that I decided to tell, I'd rather die in a cell
I was framed like a wedding flick, 2 time felon
Still a predicate, doin' time, tell 'em that's a negative
Prejudice judge, bails be a mil' in cash
Scorin' money like the meter on the Yellow Cab
Give the witness an unexpected visit
Make his story change like walls blockin' his vision
Couldn't give a clear description, fearin' the repercussions
Like, "I was on the ground, I ain't see him bustin'"
Now the DA chasin' a plea, they hatin' I'm free
The case is mistaken identity


Whoever push me like Pusha T, I push back
I push a cap, before '93, I pushed crack
I'm hood, black, you know me well, what's good, scrap?
I'm smokin' rappers, you are a L, what's good Smack?
Hold up that's Goodz rap, pardon self
I just like good rap, but when I see Goodz I give his goods back
I rap for writers that pack strap to rhymers that backpack
To 25 to lifers that jack MAC
We movin' ratchets, no Kat Stacks, it's magic
The way we flip the package before the coppers can catch it
I'm past that chapter in life, let's live it lavish
When life take a piss in your bed, you flip the mattress
Before you try and get my head, get you some Pampers
Then take a long look at my ish and get your answers
Kick in my vicinity, I'm what rappers pretend to be
Charge 'em with a penalty, mistaken identity


Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy


Fresh off of work, he jumped out the van
Two suitcases, dangle from his hands
He opened up the door, headed up the stairs
Thought he heard a noise, but no one else was there
First sight he saw, struck him by surprise
Two shots was given, between his girl's eyes
Windows blown out, no prints on the door
All he seen was blood stains, smear the damn floor
911, ambulance showed up
Blood everywhere, paramedics throwin' up
Cops cuffed him up, hit him with the charge
But he was bangin' Mrs. Prixy at the Motor Lodge
He got his alibis, gonna use 'em all
He screwfaced the judge, he might take the fall
Someone set him up, a botched robbery
Mistaken identity, yeah it gotta be


17 years old, I'm headed back to the hole
I'm mistaken identity, every way was sold
I look like a hoodlum, I rock a lot of gold
They lockin' everybody up, ship your ass up the road
I ain't have a 9 on me, they was lyin' on me
Court day with my old bird, they was spyin' on me
Tried to set me up, plantin' coke in my pocket
The beast pat me up, they won't let me off


Na-n-n-n-n-nah it wasn't me
It could never been the G-O-D, not me
You terribly mistaken, son, I ain't the one
We could never look nothin' like, whether near or far sight
What resemblance does he strike? So my mic Fahrenheit
W for my a-alike, your DNA match tight
Even if they bite us, close but not quite
They still tryna get it right, mistaken identity


Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy



Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
Wanna go home and see my wife and kids
Wanna go home..
Wanna go home..
Wanna go home..
Wanna go home..


Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy



This goes out to all my niggas
Spendin they last on gas, grass and ass
And to all my ladies playin in bars free drinks
And shit push it up push it up

Chorus
Keep on
Ya don't stop , if ya don't stop maybe ya won't stop
If ya won't stop maybe ya can't stop
So keep on, keep on an on ya keep on
Ya don't stop , if ya don't stop maybe ya won't stop
If ya won't stop than ya can't stop
So keep on, keep on an on

Verse 1
Rebellious-I, felonas city slicker
Real nigga hit ya district with the impact of a twista
Now clear the zone, rhyme down the phone lines and toss motor homes
My poems were found next to dinosaur bones
Perform by the elders before the kings thrown
This style has no origin or birth date
And scientists research can not calculate
The great mind skatin' through space and time
Vibratin' thru the bass lines that stun man kind
Reclined in the leather seat the cassette blasts
Vocals that smash out the bullet proof glass
Rippin' through your 15's like Wolverine
Sick with the lyric there be no vacine
You attach with the tractor beam, rap fiend
And all heads who feel it lick off a magazine

Chorus

Verse 1
We trip the light, ride to the rhythm's of the night
Skin tight honeys show me love at first sight
Work light krazy legs nonstop body drop
My hip hop drop you to your knees in shock
Watch for the spot rushers, slang hustler
Lackluster skills, solute the drill instructor
Yes yes ya'll I heard the S.O.S.' call
INS to the rescue about to bless ya'll
Got em brawlin' in the mess hall and the dance hall
They ants ya'll and I remain to stand tall
Can't fall, son'll restore like Michael Jackson off the wall
Singin' life ain't so bad at all
When ya livin' it we all deserve the finer things
Like foreign cars fancy clothes and diamond rings
My exotic dancers keep shakin' ya thing
To my niggas on the streets thats soon to be king

Chorus

Verse 3
Keep on keep on an on
Last call for alcohol bartender two kahlua's and milk
With crushed ice in the blender
What up love?
Lets jelly off the dancefloor
Before ya man come lookin' for points he can't score
More than you bargained for ,deserve an encore
Putt 'em down ,you put em up till ya sore
Motion picture thoughts project in wide screens
Laced off the lime green, duckin' high beams
Swift sword, making fetti out the bill board
Rap pro, throwin' up bombs like Jeff Joard
Catch me next tour feel free to explore
Don't sweat me at the door like we met before
Tryin' to dick ride, I'm inside where the chicks hide
Quick slide move, we lootin' the spy...
Quick slide move, we lootin' the spy

Chorus




This goes out to all my niggas

Yeah, the mothafucking bookie, holding down my rights
You dig? Eyeballs on this nigga (Capp I see you)
One time for your mothafucking mind (Let's tear this shit up)
We bout to get out of order right now (What the flying fuck is goin on?)
Yo, yo, yo, yo


We gon shut this game down and move unheard
"When ya'll ready, ready, ready to rock"
We gon shut this game down and move unheard
"Rock with it if you overstand"
We gon shut this game down and move unheard
"When ya'll ready, ready, ready to rock"
We gon shut this game down and move unheard
"Stop playin mayne, bring it back now"


I Mash Out like Danze and Fame, me and my comrades snatch the game
And blast the flame, the General, that's the name
I get bills, still snatch the chain, and snatch ya dame
Where I'm from, we all act the same
I move ninja before you can flash the frame
Gangsta boogie, up jumps the boogie
With twin Glock nines and a Champion hoodie


Yo thats me in the grind, I'm always gritty
Staten Island, I represent New York City
And where I come from, son it ain't no joke
There's fires in the building, you get killed by smoke
And if you not alert, it's like Berlin, when we goin bezerk
Hustlin again, puttin in hard work
Time to bring everybody back together like it's the new church
New Mass!




Jets in the city, my rep get checks in the city
With all my connects in the city, my set get gritty
Name hold weight like I bench seven fifty, you craps better get me
We gon ride for it, do or die for it
Catch a homicide for it, never swicth sides for it
Might spit a clip in your face
We hungry, we eats the crumbs and lick plates


Now when the Europeans came, we flexed our skills
We used to be poor, but now we pay the bills
Some of ya'll vultures rob and kill just to eat
We in the streets, tryin to live our lives
Me and my hood peoples in the hills like East Berlin
Hold pens through hotels, mountain lions
Move on them like they did to the Mayans
Big irons for the sake of those thats at rest
Lebanon Don, Inspectah Deck
These niggas don't understand us, but show us respect




Joe Young, Wu-Tang, gonna bubble you hard
You weaklings, I told ya'll niggas from the start
We'll tear you apart, you know what I'm sayin?
Come through in the black Navigator, come out, spray ya
Only thugs get shook, fuck the mayor
This is meyhem, third world war shit
Ya'll niggas want competition, buy my rap kit
Peace to Banga, Danja and Deck
These are Urban Icons, nigga, show respect before I show you the tech
I'm duckin high, niggas stay low
Before I step through you niggas like the Stargate hole
Who want war? Smash ya face on the floor
Take from the rich and give to the poor
I rhyme sick, I shoot because of Sickamore
Your hoe wants dick or more
I'm on some shit, like, stick em all, kick in the door





*bees buzzing*
*man screaming in torture*


This is... (Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream)
Serious, the craziest.. Da.. da!
(Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream)
Day-da.. danger, dangerous... style


Lyrical shots from the Glock
Bust bullet holes on the charts
I want the number one spot
What's the science? I'm a giant
New York defiant, brutal like domestic violence
Silence of the Lambs, occurred when I slammed in
Program the jams to be fat as Ralph Kramden
Others come with shit as silly as Art Carney
But my technique tranquilizes more kids than Barney
Remedy for stress is three bags of sess
A day at my rest playing chess, yes
My thoughts be sneaky like a crook from Brooklyn
When you ain't lookin, I take the queen with the rook then
I get vexed, layin phat trax on Ampex
Puffin skunk, gettin drunk off of Triple X
Ballantine, I got more love than valentines
The violent mind, I blast with a silent nine


My hazardous thoughts to cut the mic's life support short
Brains get stained like tablecloths when I let off
Powerful, poetry pushed past the point of no return
Leaving mics with third-degree burns
Let me at 'em, I grip your style like a spasm
Drag 'em through the mud then I bag em
We're screaming hardcore, hip-hop drips out my pores
And I be raw, for four score plus seven more
I strike like a bowling ball, holding y'all hostage
Like jail, electrifying like the third rail
Beats are smashed with paragraphs of ruckus
Wu-Tang!


(Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck wit...)
Hot time, summer in the city
My people represent, get busy
The heat-seeker, on a mission from hell's kitchen
I gets in where I fits in for head-touchin, listen
Enemy, is the industry got me flippin
I don't give a fuck tell that bitch and a nigga
I'm killin, snipin, catchin murder cases
Desert Stormin', I be searchin for oasis
As I run a mile with a racist
Pullin, swords, hit the Billboard with a bullet
Peace to the number seven
Everybody else get the four nine three eleven


(Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream)
I don't know what's going on if you can take us there...


Yo, watch me bang the headpiece there's no survival
My flow lights up the block like a homicidal
Murder, underground beef for the burger
P.L.O., criminal thoughts you never heard of
I switch, the city never sleeps, life's a bitch
I shit, runnin through bitches like Emmitt Smith
Caution, niggas best to be careful crossin
The street, before they end up layin in a coffin
Don't sleep, niggas tend to forget, however
Peep this  my nigga Kase lives forever


What evil lurks in the heart of men?
It be the shadow, street-life, flowing again
I had a plot, scheme, I knew for sure
Only one kick would knock the hinges off the door
The dread tried to jet, Sabrina at his neck
Thirteen pounds on the table plus a tec
Just when I said, "Where the fuck's the cream?"
Another dread came out the kitchen with the M-16
He tried to cock it, blast three shots like rockets
Crushed his collarbone, ripped his arm out the socket
My move for the table was swift, I got my hostage
(The nigga tried to stab you God!) but I dodged it
Niggas said, "Carlton you'se a ill motherfucker"
Cause I made it look like they both killed each other
And I'm out


Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream
Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream


You know what I'm saying? (Tical)




I make 'em nod like ketamine
See him live might dive off the mezzanine
Ground drama, sound harder than crowd bonkers
I'm 'bout dollars, I touch down in your town, holla
INS, gladiator, call him Hustle Crowe
Son of pro, watch these lame niggas come and go
Blessed with the poison pen
Murder was the case so I guess it's them boys again
Through your duce high, salute I, be the general
The last one to run, I will take all ten of you
I'm feeling myself BK whiling the belt
Rocking my shit, eyes on the real wealth
Me and Goldie tell 'em it's easy money
Now shorty wanna fuck, that's sleazy, honey
Fame call us, money, it change all us
Get it how you live it or sing the same chorus
The game taught us, nothing in the bank for us
W claim walrus, yeah, Wu-Tang for life


Was raised on the island of the misfits
The children of the corn snatch your green with the biscuits
It's what you might call food for thought
And what's the killer season if you don't include the salt
This thought will start a feud and leave your whole mood distraught
Used to feel safe until they unscrewed your vault and
Took your common sense out your memory bank
Then dumped on you like missiles over enemy tanks
So homie, drive slow like you in front of five-O
Cause forks go in a road and your back is where the knives go
While the addicts hiding silver spoons
Being cut so deep, it's hard to heal the wounds
Those flashing don't blast, they still buffoons
Just blowing out hot air, they should fill balloons
Yo, I like them shorties that'll kill for goons
And start a hustle in an April to ccop wheels in June


I want leverage, ice cold beverage
Money I can't count, I blacked out standing on Mount Everest
Life lessons, the cover of essence
It's pure excellence, 5'10", write down my measurements
Politic the deficit, fingerprints, no evidence
Cocaine, caviar, hitting on receptionists
Hang with the specialists, gold medalist
Presidential cred, eating steaks that's tenderest
Got my bread, catch me in Megan Fox' bed
Cash crop, Gucci IPad, bag
Tall black top Nikes, with fat laces
Riches from rags, cashes and dime faces
Got promoted up, friends up in high places
Next move, my best move, chess move, the strategy
Closet full of guns, son, nothing but gadgetry
Get off that bullshit, that hip hop faggotry
I'm highbred nigga words defy gravity
Clothes never raggedy, oil paintings of me displayed up in gallery
Capture me, Wu Tang forever, immortality
High salary, blessing from a mother named Valery
And my two sons named after me
Racks from stacks, swiftly I'm browsing
First class ticket to the moon only cost fifty thousand
Niggas be doubting, it's understood, I'm running with goons
One of a kind, imported goods, killer the hood
Consume me, Lord, the last time I checked got 50 points on the board
Good Lord




Yeah, yo, there's a dozen ways to die, six million ways to do it
Let's go through it, my mind flow like fluid
Torture, chop your legs up, thrown off the boat
Guillotine, nigga, one chop to the throat
Suffocation, saran wrapping your face
Buried alive, throw a few nails in the case
Manslaughter, eight degrees of separation
Leave your body chopped up in a piece, that's mutilation


Six million ways to die, cyanide in your drink
Catch a Cuban necktie for your mink
Dahmer style, cut up and stuffed in the fridge
And maybe washed up ashore and found under the bridge
Hit him with the whip, drag him half a block
Machete or the sock full of padlocks
Chainsaw, switch your medication
Stomp a nigga out til he one with the pavement


Torture, he's gruely peaking at the meeting
Suspicions of him being a rat? Even worse than cheating
I'm cold reaking of ice picks, scratch and sticks and closed fists
Brassknuckle steel toe kicks
Cracked ribs, punctured lungs, hard breathing
He's gasping and wheezing for air, his breath he can't catch
He clinches the shirt on his chest
In a dying effort to reveal his last will before he was killed


First things first, I chop your head to your fingertips
Butcher knife your torso, chop up your ligaments
Make sure it's legitimate, conceal all my fingerprints
Chop, chop your body up quick then get rid of it
A hole in the desert, body bag, just polluted it
Your miss was a snitch too? Shotgun killed the bitch
Leave her in the wilderness, suffocated and scarred up
Your brother want more too, blow his fucking car up


Another homocide city, murder mystery efficiently
Delete your fucking history broke bone, missing teeth
Throw bones, it's slippery, brings on the triple beam
All topped and chopped up, my luck is a Mr. Clean
Clorax and vicious steam sterilized the whole scene
Photograph your death so I can spread it to your whole team
Won't leave a trace of evidence for the case
It's sinister to finish it, hit with the man with no face


Red wine and pink veal
Unknowing that this would be his last meal
Comfortable hes made to feel, six inch stiletto heel
Kept his refills filled
Titties like big ass, kept him still for the real deal
Hitman from Brooklyn, Tommy gun specialist
Our one accomplice, sipped Courvoisier at the bar
Then waited till she lit a cigar
Then sprayed
In shattered wine glass he lay, he never saw it coming


Yo, murder one, bullets went fast through the flesh
I cocked the sawed off shotty, put a hole in your chest
Blow your lungs out, I've seen you been smoking for years
You got no heart, I'll hunt you down like Cape Fear
Push your brains out the back of your head, blow off your hands
Leave your body in a dumpster, head in the trashcan
Cell catching scene look clean as a whistle
Ghost carved through your skin tissue til the bone grizzle




Yeah, yo, there's a dozen ways to die, six million ways to do it

Another homocide city, murder mystery efficiently

Blow bones to smithereens, brings on the triple beam
All topped and chopped up, mop buckets and Mr. Clean
Clorax and vicious steam sterilized the whole scene

Leave your body in a dumpster, head in the trash can
Cell catching scene look clean as a whistle
Ghost carved through your skin tissue, till the bone grizzle




Crack that pineapple open
Vision of break faces, gettin' money lay in the boats
Got big rifles, play the hood, ride Benz cycles
Y'all mens are psycho, Killah Hill 'ciples
More fly generics, money make moves, forget it
We got this locked since nineteen-seven
So many rods and weapons, ain't no more reppin's
Take the shit back, faggot, we hate that
Meet the real, we lock the real, me/him lock the steel
Pop off, pull out, drop them bills
I run with all real killas, all for realers
Nikes on, awesome gorillas
Want more then kill 'em, front war, reveal 'em
I want him stretched out, listen, he lost the buildin'
All fly gangstas, more bankers, hundred wit' us
We ex-dust niggas, don't even touch my drink
Fuck around, get shanked, stabbed, shot and broke
Ya' yolked and he blast-es through you in the faint
All my niggas get paint, yo what's my name?
Lexus Diamond, Ice Water Inc


Huh.. (uh-uh-uh-uh)
Uh! Yeah!
Once again in the motherfuckin' place
Fix yo' motherfuckin' face, nigga
Yeah.. you know how we gets down
Me and this mixo, we so.. we so tight
Lex Diamond sound, and uh
I bees the High Chief, Jamel Arief
Straight from East Medina
And uh.. yo.. yeah!
Yeah.. huh!


They started jammin' in the park, just after dark
Two turntables and their DJ scratchin'
Words seemed to have an attraction when they rhymin'
Hip-hop caused the guns to start sparkin'
Temperature risin'
Drape a nigga up with the ratchet, less talkin'
Caught him on the 'nard, bomb like a G. hard
Explosion rocks the Promenade, I'm God
And he show and provin', 'knowledge how he movin'
Smift as the wisdom, move from my gate in a drunken state
I wrote this degree, adjust ya eyes in the light so you could see
Never fall victim, dictate the fate
Leave the bake for the snake
If he take than I take his head without question
In the one to fourteen check the Justice lesson
Now uh!


Uh! It's the pineapple Daquiri fuckin' up ya mindstate
Ya heard? (Yeah) Spread the motherfuckin' word
Yo!


I'm from where it's real, niggas peal ya' orange
We want enough bricks that we could build apartments
I. General in the field of marksmen
The Bad Boys wit' me ain't Will or Martin
Feel what I'm droppin', I spit the ill doctrine
Spot him deep in the Killah Hill poppin'
Two feet dug in the dirt, up to the skirt
Spectator on the sideline lovin' the work
And my team ain't ya' average, CREAM we handle it
Fiends seekin' packages, beams and banana clips
Festo! If you wit' me, let's go!
The nymphos love me, X-O, X-O
Boy listen hard, think twice before you get involved
We hold the weight like cons in the prison yard
They call the riot squad, we live and in charge
Y'all non-beleivers get reminded with scars
It's the pineapple, Rebel I. natural
Fine wine hundred proof, spittin' mine at you
(CHUH-PUGH! Nigga!)

My style, sick as the plague
Hold ya head, like I'm trimmin' ya fade
Now witness the raid, Rebellion, spittin' them blades
That'll tear ya "Face/Off" like Nicolas Cage
In the brick maze, ain't slept in six days
Trippin' off a spliff of haze, rollin' trip trays
I need, one followed by zero, he's some kinda hero
Analyze This, like DeNiro


I'm not the man, I'm just one of the men
You don't wanna cross me, I'm like a hundred & ten
Truck Turner burning the steel, child style working the mill
Like I still kill, serving them crill
Can't stop til I'm splurging a mill', gorilla lurk in the field
With my lean on, swerving my wills
Full time with the grind, like nine on the limb
Lone Ranger, so I don't conspire with them
Got men that'll fire the sem', see me sliding with the diamond
Like four or five of them, inside the Benz
It's the, main event when son slip through
Old timers recognize, with the young kids too
Damn right, I'm still 1-6-Ooh
Young G out to get his due, you can't fit his shoe
In the hood like graph' on the wall, snatchin' it all
Niggas hate me, I'm just, having a ball
Yeah y'all, still hang in the halls, or macking them broad
Or at the fiend house, bagging a raw
And I'm alright, sending y'all a kite
Boss tight with the mic, y'all call it a night
It's the, gener-al, keep backin' them off
Backin' more, throw it down like Shaq in the fourth
You a cartoon in back of The Source, I clap off
And the, strongest quake couldn't match the force
Disrespect me, the eagles'll squeeze, my peoples is G's
Who put the work in and breeze in the D's
Keep several TV's in the V's, now wise men speak in degrees
Had you leaking with ease, fools





Born with the struggle, used to hustle for crumbs
Fillin blunts in the building front, thuggin for ones
Full-clips fly, nicks, dimes, suckin the pump
Whole cliques fly, whips, dimes, nothing to son
City boy on the corner, I was so involved
So the drama I embraced, it would open arms
Tryna shake the pain, hoping I could break the chains
Everyday the same - who am I to make it change?
Real, my niggas risk it all just to play the game
And the young'uns going through it trying to play the same
Through the rain, through the fire, handcuffed by desire
Cynthia's son, forgive me for all the sins that I've done


My life, my pain lasts forever
Nothing in these streets makes it better
My life, my pain lasts forever
Nothing in these streets makes it better
So I live on..

Got a lot on my mind
As my life's shrinking and I'm caught in the times
It's a quarter to nine and I'm grabbing my nine
I had dreams, I just wanted to rhyme
Climb my ways out this wack-ass ghetto
I signed my name on the line with the Devil
Still in my prime ? to settle
Pots on the stove, old grandma's kettle
Late for my job - "he thinks he's a star!"
She hates her husband, he says I'm a slob
Mixed feelings, she ain't getting involved
Battle of the sexes, the planet off its axis
The IRS, god damn I owe these taxes!
The true verse, but I can take it
It's a long time coming, but I can make it
No mistaking, the CREAM is back..


My life, my pain lasts forever
Nothing in these streets makes it better
My life, my pain lasts forever
Nothing in these streets makes it better
So I live on..

I got my niggas, true niggas, real niggas
Stop the wheel, really?
You only feel me if you walk the same road
Talk the same codes
Still dwelling in the Hell and find the time to make a home
The few who escape tryna find a safer zone
I ain't waiting for Obama, never doubted him
I'm proud of him. He real, spend a couple million on the housing and
Seeing is believing, my vision is blurred
Cause I ain't seen nothing, I heard
Really ain't nothing but words, divine my mind
I'm still stuck to the curb
Sky high, but it wasn't the shurm
Really nothing but herbs - I risk it all for the cause
Even if it's war with the law
I can't/won't/don't stop, I ain't got an off switch
Dying trying to live it, just to get a small part of it
My squad is sick type that you don't want problems with
Rolling like 70 Mack trucks - what's stopping it?




I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Five score years ago, a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today


Look, homicide is illegal, death is a penalty
Never let go when you've got ahold of your enemy
Eagle claw cobra clutch by any means necessary
Ill never let it go, see my shadow ninja mic flow
I throw a great archer dart arrow to your temple
Almighty bow of Ulysseus the indigenous
Plan of the Wu-Tang Clan became a world brand
We never let it go, we talk a half a mil a show


Never let go of your mind
Its a terrible thing to waste
To lose, but its very hard to find
Being that ignorance is lethal
We must touch hearts, tune souls, harmonize the people
Never let go of your plan, execute
So when you shoot, inspire everyone on the land
Never lose knowledge of yourself
For it may become risk to your health
And great loss of wealth


Never let go of your cream, never let go of your dream
Players retire, but they never let go of the team
If you a rider then you never let go of that thing
Pull up your mans like you better let go of that bling
This lifes crazy, too many life sentences, maybe
Fatherless babies on the block but they father 380
Thats just the hood lately, never let go
Im what the hood made me
Momma told me to find a good lady


Never let go of staring at the death
Like yo, that's your best blow
I still hold on like En Vogue
The cold go to war with the heat
Eyes wide, never falling asleep
All the talking is cheap
Call'em, ultimate warrior, W.W.F
I come up victorious, struggle is nothing to Deck
Set it straight for the seeds, to see a better new
Take the real life by the rings and I aint letting go
I aint letting go


No matter what the odds be
No matter how hard we
You never let go


Never let go of the fight, never let go of the mic
My honesty, my values, my loyalty, my pride
And memory of those who have passed to the other side
Never letting go, Im never letting go of my beliefs
My faith, convictions, real
Both hands holding on, never let go the wheel
We hood legends, misunderstood
These lessons, learned
Growing up for manhood
Keep focus on the prize what you better do
A little taste of heaven, sunshine is where we headed to
States whats ahead of you, always on the schedule
Smoke the gold leaf down to the residue
Letting go, is something that I never do
Those who let go, live life regrettable
Never let go of your hope or your rope
Eyes on the prize, never let go of the scope
When Im in jail, never let go of the soap
Hold on, boy, never let go


Never let go, the all-eye-seeing, the supreme
Never let go the love of your seeds, or your queen
Never let go your heart, or the place you started
The feeling that I had, Wu-Tang had just charted
The old earth departed, I give thanks to the martyrs
I never let go the love I have for thy father
Never let go the glow
The more I know the more that it shows
I wont let go, even if I decompose
Your seed will carry it on, we need to carry it on
Pass the baton, life is just the marathon
And ain't' playing to win it, its an epidemic
Never let go, thats what the god recommended




And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. Who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. For many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom




No need to adjust your system
This song  call it Jack Herer, cause a hit strong
Fist pump, Rebel on the set make your bitch jump
Doubt me? Get in line, cause the list long
Scandalous tight Nixon
'Melo in your face, like the Knicks on
Dick long, gripped in the pits with my wits on
Low quick, short wick on a lit bomb
Better strong any record Inspectah on
I transform to a beast, call me Predacon
Upper echelon, that can rap 'til he dead and gone
Was an ex-con, now I get my checks on
Now a nigga's alright, like I'm never wrong
Headstrong, stepping through a present-day Lebanon
Like Marvin, I get it on, Rebel gone set it off
Then I jet set where the weather's warm


Florida or something
(scratching)


Listen, I'm a visionary, killing this, I'm stealing this
Hang with a gang that's villainous
Building this from the ground up, turn the sound up
Lounge around, let the beat pound, like a Dillinger
The handgun, can't come close, I'm a phantom
Your brand ain't a movement and your jam ain't an anthem
Tantrum, crying bitch, if battling's your dying wish
I'm a genie, that'll grant that shit, I insist
Fly shit, shrunken little sweater, yeah we tight knit
Tight kicks, flow holy water, like Christ spit
Ice pick, swing that mother-fucker like a night stick
Prisoners, tie son up, that Iron Mike shit
Listeners, take a deep breath I mean I'm recessed
ES, mint issue one, you the re-press
Refresh your funny style, you should redress
Speak less, what's a Braveheart with a weak chest?


A knock-out blow, he's down for the count
Listen to this


I spit bomb, kill 'em softly with this song
Clique strong, this ain't nothing like a chick song
Big John, in the shower with a big blonde
Switch on the power, little sour in the big bong
I'm big, homes, y'all ain't living 'til you live long
Big-boned honey, trying to keep me in the friend zone
I touch down, try and put it in her end-zone
Pimp on, then I dip on her like I'm Jim Jones
Yes y'all heard the rest, who the best, y'all?
You slept off, I'm a threat, what you rep, dog?
Respect, dog, here's a bone: go and fetch, dog
Mr. Method, my favourite letter is "F", y'all(Ha!)
As I continue where we left off
Next off the list, another hater is checked off
Get lost you trick, check boss, or bet's off
More music and less talk, I'm talking about


I walk down the street people look at me and say, "Who the hell are you?", I'm just an average Joe


Dr Yorgo, the EQ on this will make Czarface's brain bleed. He'll become so enraged, he'll self destruct.(cackles)

Don't be so foolish, you oaf! I knew Suckface would be stupid enough to surface again

Sir, it's Czar and they love him, because he's a hero

Well, every hero needs a villain



* appeared on promo (radio) copies of "Uncontrolled Substance"

"Children grow and women produce
And men go work, and some go stealin
Everyone's got to make a livin"


Yo, yo, murderous specialist tactics
In effect y'all, in effect y'all
In effect y'all, yo, yo
Yea, it's all about, it's all about
It's all about how you live it
It's all about how you live it
How you live it...


Yo, a big time slinger named Ty from Bed-stuy
Had all the drug blocks locked on the westside
Nickels and dimes, sellin drugs of all kinds
But never seen on the streets in the day time
When it gets dark and the clock strikes six
If you standin on the block, you gots to face the click
Prepare to be stuck, young buck, you wanna gamble?
Got to pay dues if you plan to scramble
Ty has spots, Glocks, knots in the web for throwin away cops
He had a piece named Alice, she was no joke
Quick to wet a nigga who tryin to cut throat
But, yo, Ty was no new Jack, he knew that
He was marked for death cuz niggas had contracts
He had mad uzis in his crib
He paid 300 g's in the boondocks in Jersey
And at his lab was the '98 Lex with the rag
He never drove cuz he moves in cabs
A veteran in art of drug peddlin
No one could stop him or knock him cuz he's headed in
The direction that gets his click filthy rich
For gettin paid on the night shift

"Everyone's got to make a livin" (x4)


On the shadowy midtown streets, there's a hooker
Crafty-ass hoe by the name of brown sugar
Large as a blimp, mad miss wearin garments
Like mink coats cuz she cut her pimp's throat
The ordinary prostitute, she got the Power U
Made niggas come back, spendin mad loot
Her style's wild with the blade in her purse
Slice her twice before you feel the first
Sweatin Madison Avenue high-class bars
With plenty of Broadway stars and fly cars
Swingin her back to the labs that they rest at
Hittin her off with stacks for her sex acts
And all types of expensive merchandise
Diamonds, gold, whatever fits the price
Yo, she didn't need no man, she had the upper hand
Walkin around with grands wrapped in rubber bands
For real, she was colder than blue steel
Millitant bitch with a switch and high heals
Daylight strikes, yo, the hoe was out of sight quick
And at night, she's back on the strip for the night shift

"Everyone's got to make a livin" (x4)


Yo, a kid named Keith, he's a professional car thief
Cops give him props, his pops is the police chief
Model citizen, no jail convictions
Night time, flippin on a stolen car mission
Roll up in parkin lot, find a dark spot
Grab the screwdriver, pop the car lock
One hand pose, layin by the windows
Tryin to get the dough before the chop shop close
No acs, no macks, no Jeeps and cheddars
Benzes, Lexes, 50 grand and better
Tenants organized to stop his ball
But he gots the fall to get paid and make a pocket full
Early AM, he's at it again
Pop the trunk, snipped the alarm and made his way in
Then make his way out without a doubt
On a route to get hit, with a nice large amount
For the night shift

"Everyone's got to make a livin" (x4)




Wu-Tang for life nigga (House Gang, nigga what's up?)
I ain't gon' never lay my flag down (Carlton Fisk, the criminal)
Fuck what ya'll niggas is sayin', ya hear me? (D.C., Donnie Cash, La Banga)
We gave ya'll niggas life man, watch ya mothafuckin' mouth (Raider Ruckus)
The general, yo (W.T.C., nigga)


I'm the gladiator, General Max
Resident patient, stay sick, that's a medical fact
That's my House Gang set in' it back, settin' the track
Only hood you be in, got a sweater attached
I'm in the pits with the bulls and wolves
Clip fulls in tools, strip fools, cliques, groups, and crews
Sip Bulls, spit blues for dues
Split grooves, who's you
Ain't no stoppin', this dude's the truth
Like number 34, Paul Pierce, I ball fierce
Push your wig back, then roll up in pallbears
For years, I swung hard as Tyson's cross
Tore the roof off in white tee's, Nikes, and shorts
Fuck mic's in The Source, I'm tryin' to live like a crime boss
Mansion, garage, five bikes, and a Porsche
It's the high price of power, and your life's the cost
So it's pressure on you birds like them dike's up north
Only seen with the flyest of queens in two seaters
Size double duece on the shoes with tube speakers
East side, duckin the 5
In these mean streets we beast U.D.'s, man it's nothin' to ride
If it's war, I'm leavin' nothin' alive
It's on to the grave, then I'mma catch your ass on the other side
So run and hide, and pray to God stay low
Before we step through you niggas like the Stargate hole
It's the H.G.'s, U.D.Z's we king size
Box you up like a order of five wings and fries nigga (You ain't heard nigga)
Box you up like a order of five wings and fries nigga


They all talkin' gangsta (But ain't nobody scared)
They neck is full of diamonds (But don't nobody care)
They claim they got millions (But ain't no millionare)
They say they in the hood (But you neva see 'em there)


Yeah, we in the mothafuckin' Killa Hills 10304
House Gang, 2-4 war
Undadogz, Urban Icons
Ya dig, come see us



*harpsichord solo*


THERE'S NO sinning, bears getting dressed to kill
Laughing down the sun like a jackal will
With his eyes ablaze and his lips apart
He's gonna fill his cup with the love in your heart
And drink it up till the morning starts
Circulate the red light this is get the girls and get the sis'
Pinch him up and give em bliss
Kissin fears with all his might forever


Standed on the verge of the edge of the ledge
Waitin for me to fall, then I got a call
It said, "WAIT HOLD UP HOMEY, YOU MUST BE TRIPPIN
YOU CAN'T BE PUTTIN THAT STRIPPIN AND WHIPPIN
UP IN YOUR PIMPIN, YOU BETTER STAND TALL
FOOL YOU WAS BORN TO BALL
TOOK A LITTLE FALL AND NOW YOU WANNA END IT ALL
YOU BEEN CHASIN DREAMS LIKE A HOUND DOG ON THE HUNT
Take your place in the front wit yo' hands on the blunt
And it's right in your grasp man, I know they laughin
BUT YOU'LL BE LAUGHIN LATER CUZ TIMES IS GON' GET GREATER!"


That's when you least expect it
You understand there is no exit


Aiyyo rock that *shit*, slamdance to this
Move the *fuck* back when you see us in the mosh pit
Smash something when my heavy metal raps thump in
Crack more heads open than Beck's, you and your mans floated
Tales From The Crypt, Rocky Horror couldn't Picture it
Spine-tingling, give you goose bumps singin it
*Bitch-ass niggas* scared to party wit The Infamous
We jumpin over the bar snatchin mad liquors


Out of the darkness, spark this total chaos
Mark to scheme the hardest, nothing can save us
All that is sacred, dearly departed
Braveheart slave brave contains something courageous
Salute shining armor, persona rip stages
Loud as Nirvana, beneath the golden ages
The road rash explode, little rigor that devour
Don't cry for me, I'm bout drunk off the power

Chorus  2x
Who's gonna cry for ya
Who's gonna cry over you


Now if you think my Infamous Mobb remains untamed
And we out for the cash while you out for the fame
Lay back, count on my stack down to Cognac
Writin my raps, here hold that, it's bound to go plat
When my bang hits, relentless, whatever I spit
Like a fresh pair of kicks outta the box, ready to rock
You know the drilly stay collaboratin wit my committee
Then it's on the L-I-E to QB city


Yo yo
We storm the sound clash, but none heard the sound of the blast
Send the mass outta control, the system found smash
There's blood on the dance floor, they still chant "More!"
The nitty gritty, New York inner city
Fifty caliber thoughts force the world to bang wit me
Bound to hit hard like twenty gods benchin in the yard
Men at large take charge, out to make ours and take ours
We fought against all odds
Party crasher, verbal assault, quick to blast ya
Ya stunned momentarily, dropped seconds after

Chorus 2x

*guitar solo*

Chorus to end




Carlton Fisk, I.N.S., we got Chico
Staten's back... the monster, come on
House Gang... House Gang... now we gat y'all
Check it...


You abandoned me, y'all don't live here anymore...
Just a vacancy, y'all don't live here anymore...


The scene open, see my mother at a table, focused
A belt wrapped around her arm, veins bulging
A bottle top, a little cotton, intervene this needle dirty bopping
Hands swollen, psalms untoppable
Little kid I watch the nod, know the rules
Never talk to a teacher in school
You might think that this environment's cruel
Fuck it, this what I decided to do
Started stealing anything I could move
Now I'm thirteen, with something to prove
Buddha hit me with a twenty-two
That started my career with a tool
Nothing to it, get up on 'em, tell 'em "pass it all"
Since you short, if you move, blast it off
Like a rocket, if he falls, dig his pockets and run
And if you get caught, just rep where you from, little nigga
I know what's it like out there, you strugglin' and you grinding, let's go




Thug paradise, drugs, gats and knives, life sacrifice
Nickel dime grind, catch a full clip, half price
Kings tumble in time, it's like a jungle sometimes
I play it humble, gotta rumble sometimes
Big timers taking numbers with nines, with the bundles of dimes
You wind up, with a gun to your spine
And the coppers never solve the case
Them gorillas in the mist, war, and get lost they hard to trace
Man this cold world'll scar ya fate, so I stay awake
Late night with cigars, and jars of haze
Half my comrades dead or in jail, most said I would fail
I'm still alive, getting checks in the mail
Still cowards wanna force my hand, eating off my hand
Boiling water, never lost a gram
Cash Rules, I'm pulling off the scam, catch the bossman
Sure hand, on the dice, in the game of life, life




You don't know... what it cost to pay that ride
You don't know... what you lost til it pass you by
You don't know baby, that you could, til time is fading you by
And you don't miss, all that's in your way, til you circle or try






Time to ride..
Yo... yeah..
Lord, when you droppin'?

 x2
No said date, no said date, no said date
No said date, no said date (Lord, when you dropping?)
No said date, no said date


They said the God wasn't never comin' home
Grandma in a nursin' home, my mind is blown
I'm known to walk alone, but the fam
It's deep, yeah we all love heat
These military arm' marine, sub machine gun
Legend of Brooklyn, master craftsman
Lord, when you dropping?" No said date
Thought premeditated, well calculated
The air's been tested, the people can't wait
So, ahh - we agreed to send one, to swim from lost and found
See truth be the life preserve, we can't drown
Drunk with the victory, the Wu cavalry
Bomb the seminar, the last "hoo-ra" for chivalry
Classical, Yo-Yo Ma, laced in the bulletproof fabric
Crafted and mastered in space
What better place of birth than the Earth
When a star is born, but the path was narrow
Float across the Verrazano, stack ya ammo
Hit 'em while we got the muscle, in the streets we hustle
For survival, watch the God reign, build me a brain
Support it with a physical frame, imperial Asiatic material
Scratch the serial, smoking him, he gonna need a miracle
Prepare for burial, it's time, .45 to your head, drop your nine
We came to collect, the debt is overdue yo
Set to connect with Deck, we pushin' through
Yvette with the red Corvette from Lafayette
Pussy stay wet and she hold Tec
Respect to the six, she sexy wit a switch
Gun never stick when 'victions for the brick
Shots lick

 x2


Heh, yo, this is No Said Date
Peace, I'm Jamel Arief, pleasure to meet you
Not to offend you, something for the mental
Straight from the Shaolin Temple, so simple
Ain't enough ink for the thoughts I think
They travel so rapid, it's hard to grasp it
No assumption, Kay Slay get the shit thumpin'
Darts stay lethal, blaze one for the people
They traveled so far to witness
The killin' of a mastermind line-for-line
Half-time, center stage, 50 yard line
Long time, man for dead
Should've been, put one in his head
Before the poison spread to the body
Partly done, 'nough said... 




Still a hustle, Staten Island
Still a struggle, New York
Still gone bubble, 10304


I'm form New York, City, Birth place of the gritty
Dog eat dog, Only Jake willing to work with me
Watch your drink before they lace your sizzurp with a mickey
Bodies will burn like dub sacks of purple sticky
Cojacks developing Kodaks of your meeting engagements
The young guns put pressure on the made men
The fiends they'll cap you for your package
The mass act savage, Little sis selling her ass and tits
Your best friend will send shots to wet ya
The bad lands, Hammers on the waist bands the regular
Trapped in this hood dwelling, selling five and dime
Cause ain't no nine to five for two time felons
And little man wanna be just like me
The saddest thing is he just might be
With a life as Christopher Walken, King of New York 'em
Resort to talking when the heat is on 'em, breathing on 'em


There's nowhere to run to, there's nowhere to hide
There's no one to trust so keep a gun on your side
Just do as the Roman's if you wanna survive
I guess that's how it go in N.Y


Oh Blue I said, you make it here you make it anywhere
Drug wars for every square, blood sport, the semis air
So watch where you walk through, watch who you talk to
Watch them young Gotti's, they'll off you
It's like a mafia plot
The fishermen find more bodies then cops
But the shots don't stop, trying to get it get it
Inside where the broads and the ballas kick it
Big city lights, whips, chicks and ice
You're living, you're victim to them sick gritty types
Drueling with they tongues out, Guns out spraying clips
Who lay in the pits and pray for a taste of it
If you can sleep you awaken by the loud sound of barking chrome
Sound foul but I call it home
So keep heat when on the roam, speak brief when on the phone
In these mean streets you all alone






I want two beef patties, special sauce, onions, tomatoes
Lettuce, on a sesame seed bun... on a a sesame seed bun, you big dummy!
Dah-dah-dah-deh-duhhhhhh (I want two beef patties)
Dah-dah-dah-deh-duhhhhhh (with onions... special sauce)
Dah-dah-dah-deh-duhhhhhh (cheese on the special sauce sesame seed bun!)
Dah-dah-dah-deh-duhhhhhh (you big dummy!)
Dah-dah-dah-deh-duhhhhhh


I rock the mic and make the crowd said "Ho!"
People if you ready to ride, then let's go
The older the wine, the more vintage
Each sentence, mature like stock dropped on beat
Sold in it's highest peak, the black panther
Call him for the answer, the Shadow Dancer
No cure for the cancer, carefully approach this near-ville approach
Tension in the street, we stressed and wanna eat
Supply, meet the demand for those who get high
Sly & the Family, carve my name in Stone, peace to Angie
On and On, Chief Jay Strong'
.44 long, state today's math and what's ya name born
The Abbott had his head reflectin' off the chrome
Bank loan for a mil', Oprah, hold me down like Dr. Phil


This is napsack rap, oint joint gas
My gats point at you now you can't point back
Penetratin' skulls, I'm diggin' holes like the mole
My sword will not dull
My daily toil's: to protect the Earth so the seeds won't spoil
Ya Frankenstein type mind like Peter Boil
Hooked on that Power-U, money, weed, power, too
Powerful God-U, fine booze, lines of snooze 
Clouds of smoke, we smoke to daybreak
We keep the leaves soaked, in that PC
Y'all best to run when y'all see me
I'm like Godzilla stompin' through Mt. Fiji
On his way to Tokyo
You hollow block head tell lies like Pinochio
Flip the Nokio phone, call my nigga T.S
"How you want the Triple X rock cut? V.S.?"
Or Princess, or simply solid
The Prince word is worth more than the wallet


Doggy doggy! We'll steal your bone!
Doggy doggy! We'll steal your bonnnne!
Doggy doggy! We'll steal your bone!
Doggy doggy! (I said!) We'll steal your bone!


I said, two beef patties, special sauce
Onions, tomatoes, lettuce on a sesame seed bun
On a sesame seed bun, you big dummy!!
Dah-dah-dah-deh-duhhhhhh
Dah-dah-dah-deh-duhhhhhh
Dah-dah-dah-deh-duhhhhhh
Dah-dah-dah-deh-duhhhhhh



 x4
One of these days and you won't be long


I'm from the home where the buffalo roam
And niggas don't give a flyin' fuck
Talk with signs up, walk with the iron tucked
Leave your eyes wide shut
Money bag's on the table, gots to get my cut
Rebel I city slicker, pick up a pretty sister
Dig her out on the table, bent off the Rmy liquor
Head splitter, deliver so cold I send shivers
From many figures, battle the world or any nigga
I'm uptown saturday night like Bill Cos'
Got weed in the jars with vanilla cigars
On the strip, eyeballin' the chicks, all in the mix
Gassed off of my shit, vibratin' the whip

 x2


Yo I'm sicker than the V12 X5
With cracks in the Rolly jumper all we do is Drink fuckin' Drive
Real niggas raise up, Mommy get your feet off the table
The cable luck bare, my man got me one on his leckle
It's nothin' for me to get up with you, guts with you
Blow off them matches and sit up with you
Aiyo the streets, what is gettin' more crazy?
Stressin' me nothin', investin' the leathers, we all into things blazin'
Slingin' coke is just a normal habit, rappers we wear
Straddlers with cannons and hatchets gettin' cheers
Yatzis are fresh off the block, block squeezin', it's real
If we get real, put pop, poppin' at your blocks equal
Take these niggas and throw 'em in lakes, it's business
Rake these niggas on the mic, display your ninjas
Nines crowns verses your nine towns
Run up with nine 9's, brown down, get to lyin' you down

 x2


I come from the slums, I ain't no dummy
My testiment talk, represent money
This Verbal Intercourse, fueled by exhaust
The bread winner, head spinner, coldest with the force
No remorse, endorse the rap artist
So flamboyant cos I pimp slap the hardest
Ever since the triumph we've been missin' them soldiers
We came tonight, boy the mission is cobra, full exploder
Bulldose through the rubbish, I'm in too deep boy
I just gotta love this, they call we too sweet
One of the nine brothers, I'm so unique
Every line that smother, the situation's grim
It's bloody sin cos every time I want out they pull me back in
I see my reflection in the chrome mac 10
Ask the passer who's faster with the pen
Then pull it, nine hollows, amorettos
That's how I like it, sweat on my wine bottles
The automobiles with them shiny assed hubs
The endo pull, with the bathtub club, my angel's in the mud
Veteran smile, that's gangsta shit, that American style
Dig it, prick or prey
I'm quick to slay with the rectifier shit, caught by the ricochet nigga

"I got to know"

 x2

"I got to know"






Money ain't a thing if I got it
Mo-mo-money ain't a thing if I got it
Money


Before the money, there was love
But before the money, it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough


Yo, sitting back plotting, jotting information on my nation
Really started from the bottom, boy cotton
But they still planting plantations, we keep buying in
Closed-minded men
Pride is higher than the prices on your Pradas and Balenciagas Balance my saga with the Henny agua
Me and my niggas tryna eat, you pussies empanada
The flow like plenty lava
With just a penny I could multiply my worth
And make you work for me for twenty hours
I swear these niggas love to copy, thanks for listening
The kid ain't been the same
Since Biggie smacked me at my christening
Watch what you dishing and please play it safe
Cause your position on the top is switching right in front your face
Rock you outta space with rhymes, I'm bustin' out
Keep ducking down, got some missiles now, headed for your house
So put the pistols down, got that red dot on your nose
Who booked the clown? I lock jaws like a blue nose
Foes keep your mouth closed or you can see the solar
I got connections that guaranteed to see closed doors
You hear that underground sonar
The way I flows then switch them
The Pros been on a mission
Listen, enter the chamber, get hyperbolic
They raisin' Macs, I raise steaks to keep them brolic
My visions is macrocosmic, pass the chronic
The mastered sonics is light years above your conscious
You're novice, but I got notes that strike nerves
I promise your minds ain't sharp like my swords
So cut the BS, and don't worry where my jeans is
And PS: Your bitch a genius, learned from my penis
I got dreams selling arenas and breaking brackets
Tenants racket, while I'm cracking a Serena
God damn, God bless the heaven that sent you
But now I'm breezing out, baby, cause my rent's due


Shit is really real out here
I said shit is really real out here (It ain't  easy)
Just trying to get a deal out here
(Money ain't a thing if I got it)
Yo, I'm screaming cream, who fucking with the rap supreme?
Joey Bad and Big Preem came to collect the green
I got a dollar and a dream, know what I mean?
And I gotta get my mama off the scene
Yo, I'm screaming cream, who fucking with the rap supreme?
Joey Bad and Big Preem came to collect the green
I got a dollar and a dream, know what I mean?
And I gotta get my mama off the scene (Joey Badass)
Cause cash ruined everything around me
Cash ruined everything around me
Cash ruined everything around me
(Wont sign to no major if no wager) (money ain't a thing)
They say money is the root of all evil
I see money as the route of all people
Cause we all follow paper trails, paper trails
And everybody gotta pay their bills, pay their bills (It ain't easy)
They say money is the root of all evil
I see money as the route of all people
Cause we all follow paper trails, paper trails
And everybody gotta pay their bills, pay their bills
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all


Before the money, there was love
But before the money, it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough




Yo, Fes Taylor the gangsta, ride on you wankstas
Now I pull it and shake ya, or bullets and bang ya
Park Hill, 240 building we make a killin'
Rap gang make a million, it's like ransom from takin' children
Ya'll create the villain, and then wanna see 'em dead
When he seein' bread, you be soaked like you peed the bed
I'm the reason you bleed
I'm squeezin' fly lead, right through ya fuckin' head
Always somethin' said
Spread love to my wolves, shed blood for my crew
Gangster it out, do what you wanna do
Want to talk city to city, and coach state to state
Betty Crocker ain't got shit on the kid, when bakin' cakes
I brake you an eighth, get on your feet, but I ain't wit'
Niggas livin' off me, wake up and smell the coffee
I know you cowards wanna off me
I ham shower, on they walkie talkies
Pull the caliber on porky


Livin' star, a constellation that can't shine
I'm hungry, when facin' starvation, I plant nines
Divined in the cut, you get touched our imposts
To the spine of the gut, when you get bust by the toast
Now you roast from the things, that I cut you on post
Smoke a Dutch to the roach, with my criminal approach
My material soaks in your brain cells
Cats with scratch serials, will crack ya egg shell
It's Leathafase bitch, get the correct name spelled
Your son, your a lame, and I'mma make your frame melt
Under the belt, lies a 3-89, loco I'm crazy
I got big guns larger then a premature baby
Now you see us all gravy, over white rice, home slice
Bring animosity, precise to your doorstep
No remorse, no regrets, I just inject death
From a handheld object that'll lay you to rest


You know how we do, lay you to rest nigga
Comin' for ya'll niggas, explosion


Nothin' to say now, industry beef
We gon' spray rounds to lay down, crime boss pay now
Don't get it fucked up, drape that'll extra grime
When I pop up, you next in line
Swift with a nine, and conflict, the four foot five
And we AWOL, can't control these Animalz, and mind that
Staten Island's back on the map
Why, the PLO, fugitives that, get used to the fact
Drama in the streets, you gon' see it, son get used to the clap
Block bust emotions, picture doggie preview that
Carlton Fisk, low on the Lex, gorilla Homicide Housing
Came to collect, no sound, just pain in your neck
This Homicide Housing, comin' for ya'll niggas


I run with, R felons, and reputed assassins
Reckless criminals, who live for the action
Like when it's on, beef becomes merciless
And this coincides with slashes, stabbings, and murders
Countless with bleep on the scene
Jet in crib, to change outfits
Hopin' they ain't seen at the time
To return to the scene of the crime
The shake cops and snitches
The name of the pitches, incorporate with a mind
Who eliminates problems in any bank in it's path of ritches
See your treasury, and life is through ya math and bitches
Half made it, half seen it, and half statistics
I know, niggas bein' tried for bodies
Cause when they got snatched for ratchets
Their guns had match for listens
Trays ya presented, is somethin' like words of a witness
That got permission, to go and criticize my flow
But one things for sho', which ya'll can't condemn this
Get with infinite glow, and ya'll can't just end it
You got beef, then kill yourself, fuck your henchmen


I roll with a dirty dozen, thirsty hustlin'
Crawl back, you heard me cousin, ya herbs be frontin'
Dangerous I came with, banger and fists
Majorin' this, you think not, wager your chips
We lay in the pits, with weed bags, razors and bigs
Fuck this cow hide, this how I, been able the gift
Make them thugs get down on the floor, we found on the low
For them pesos, we pound on your dough
Wolves in the wilderness, from bricks on the juggle
Equip with the muscle, big fish in this hustle
Chicks that'll fuck you, then bust you
No love in the struggle, and don't talk to me, I don't trust you
Raw like ants that'll bite, how to get hype
Runnin' with the mountain bike, shoutin' my kite, what up?




Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone


We don't hunt deer
Vegetarian dishes from the concierge
Presidential suites, presidential treats
Brazilian models, oilin' up my feet
10 days a month, my girl pays for lunch
3 days a week, we work out at Crunch
Time after time, line after line
Our stock increases, rhyme after rhyme
In the valley, of San Fernando
Found Q-Tip's wallet in El Segundo
Prolly been spotted on Telemundo
With more wild cards than a box of Uno
That spin like propeller, my dog like Old Yeller
Holler at the moon, my goons at Coachella


Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone


I got my hands in the pot, 500 grand in the yacht
I'm the dope man with plans to expand on every block
Wu-brand, legendary hands, hard as penitentiary rock
Now put that to your temple, the Wu symbol's 'bout to drop
Insert the beam on my Glock, got that lean in my bottle
What that mean? High self esteem, straight cream on the top
Ridin' chops similar to UFC kickbox, kick rocks
Dirty trucker pit stops, shit, grams in a Ziploc
Watch how the pitbull lock his jaws, then lock your doors
Feds watch the boards, hip hop spills out my pores
I be raw, for fourscore plus 7 more
The Clan rock the tours, we be them reservoir dogs


Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier


Guaranteed I bang hard
I plan to leave the game large, no brainwash
The devil himself could not persuade God, my blade's sharp
Circle my square, I dare you Braveheart
Before I leave your head in your hands, what's your name, huh?
My lines get in your cells like 7 Ls
Any problem, I address you like I'm sendin' you mail
Let me do well, they'd rather see me dead or in jail
But let it be my life story if they ever do tell
Know I died for what I live
An intimate connection for that infinite reflection
That's my wife and my kids, there's a price on my lid
So now my stock's high and shots fired
My niggas who was tight with the kid
I'm hot as Hell's Kitchen with the oven on
Deck bomb, teflon the rappers nothin' to a don
If I'm frontin' then respond
If not, throw up your arms, it's the Killer Bee swarm
And your set, the fuck is y'all?


You entering the 36, mastering the 18
Sliding across chamber sixth, hands down that'll crush bricks
Backs thatll break bats, this is what y'all wanted back
Classic Wu RZA track with Mathematic actual facts
That weigh heavy, the universal striking attack
Dance the drunken medley, long axe blade, machete
The shadow stepping ninja


Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier




Ha, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
One time.. yo


Never liked son from day one, bring you tool
That nigga stick you and play dumb, hate a bitch-ass
Who care where you came from, you ain't prepared
For when the pain come, this nigga scared, shook to death
From a cold stare, stuntin, knowin my brothers fiend
To do you somethin over here, we head huntin
In the function I smell fear, adrenaline start pumpin
I Smash Pumpkins, Hard Rock be in the Cafe
Tear the club up, and anyone that try to judge us
The last days, makin sure I get the last say
In the food chain, is you predator or prey?
If you featherweight, lyrics blow your back
Crack your vertabrae, lookin for a better way
To get my point across, thoughts accelerate
At the same speed, of the muder rate
Lord, never perpetrate a fraud, til my nigga Carlton Fisk
See the boss, truly yours, Mr. Meth


Life's a snippet, one way ticket
Time tickin fast, blink you might miss it
Semen on Street shit, you might catch fifty stitches
Body bag sprayed up, buried in muddy ditches
I play for keeps, bust heat you catch cold feet
My rap sheet, speak for itself, concrete
Evident, Killa Hill, resident, double dart agent
Secret intelligent my rap style's flagrant


Feel the sting of a killa bee, Johnny Blaze
Street Life, Deck and Mobb Deep, Play IV Keeps
In the city that you never sleep, pay attention
Ain't no shittin when you gotta eat, we hold it down


I move like Mad Max 'cross the wasteland
One hand holds the head of the last brave man
Made man, Cuban Link chain of command
Authorized fam', hot like Sahara sand
My live team turn the club to a crime scene
High beams flash, promoters die behind CREAM
Get your face blown, might face the chrome
We take this more serious than just a poem


I think about a lot of shit, especially when I'm bent
About the foul shit goin on in my life, current event
It's evident I smoke ciggarette down to Brownsville
Thinkin to myself -- how many lives must my pound kill?
Hopefully none, ain't the one to give chase
Hemmed by Jake, worryin who might turn state's
So I chill, put my killa niggas on the battlefield
On the low plottin silent murderer, never doubt still
Never follow beef hey beef follow me
Wanna settle in the court I say settle in the streets
Like our pops did it, you got gats get hot with it
Now you dry snitchin, because you got knocked with it
I just rock with it, go with the flow, think for a hot minute
Stash my dough secure the funds of profit


Yo, extreme rhyme niggas, you wastin your time
Fuckin with my niggas, extrordinary line swishin
Your mind out position, tryin to figure this shit
Rewind it and listen quick, you might miss this
Olympic, rap jave-lon, travel beyond, your weak song
Doin this for too long, to not come strong
You're only a pawn of Viet Dong
Tryin to form against mines, you musta just been born
Secluded on a distant farm
This is the real world, where niggas get shot and shanked
Where there's tremendous pain, you get your frame inflamed
Crushed to dust, by the next man's clutch
It's Infamous you fucks, intense bad luck..




Stand strong on our two feet, we all ready
For a war here, fuck peace, what?
Stand strong on our two feet, we all ready
For a war here, fuck peace, peace




Yeah
INS, 7, Eso
Here we go


Birds in the coop murder herbs in my boots
Blue convertible, heavy head swerve on the juice
Bottom to the top, pops hot like the bottom of the pot
Top dollar, you can spot him at the spot
Flow Murder One, third world slums heard of son
Overtime grind get it first come
A-Team Hannibal, 88th page in the manual
Maintain, handle intangibles
You see me push through, bully at the park
Do it like the crooks do, hoodie after dark
Spark with the flamer on, bang a drum
On til the break of dawn, take him on like Jason Bourne
Later on, poly with a model chick
I ain't into politics, 1-6 call me a lobbyist
Know there's no stoppin' this
Years from now, homie still rockin' its
Dark knight roaming the metropolis


"Ringside table, batman?"
"Um, just one, thanks. I'll stand at the bar"
"Poisonous thoughts"
"You're breathing fire"
"I'm breathing fire"
"Comin' out hard"



Through my pugilist struggle
Me and the mic make a beautiful couple
Musically we lift em without moving a muscle
I punching crews like I'm Russell
You wanna tussle with pitbull muzzle
We can reduce you to rubble, you don't want no trouble
I'm Zeus in a goose bubble
Producing a verbal beef
With the Wu and the crew is deep
With a lucrative hustle
Now see, I can be a 
Put you rappers to the drum
Cut your pinky finger off for fronting, that's a rule of thumb
Fuck your motherfucking beats, I don't care who they from
Check it out (You good, right?)
Yeah, yeah I'm good, listen
I put the "am" in "ammunition"
Cause I am a hammer spittin'
Superman be on a mission, but y'all change in a booth
Yeah, my fam-a-lam I'm missin, but I'm handlin my business
Keep the planets on collision while maintaining the truth
You off course like a lost pilot
You can meet the shepherd, cause I'm violent like the Lost pilot
No one survived it
No one survived it




Liquor all over my liver I'm still sippin' there
Grab it guzzle it down like I don't give a shit
That's how I fight back like, "Life, take that"
Right to the heart that's why that shit be burning my chest
I invested in all the shit they sell you in
You's a little man, the sky's the limit all that other shit
Blah blah blah, get a tad older than it's evident
That you gon' settle in whatever job can help you pay the rent
Jimmy Olsen and the Super Friends
That line was doper than a motherfucker but you couldn't understand
Metaphoric to my light bright, why do I fight?
Up down, bottle top, left in the wrong fight
Czar of the gong show, that's an oxymoron
Don't ever call me crazy motherfucker, I'm just throwed off
Back to the gong show, I bet you didn't get it
Ha-huh-ha, get it niggas is so dritty
If you believe in fate then that means that life's scripted
Give or take a couple of pages for quick edits
I just rip out them pages, nothing is ever sacred
I'm searching for an oasis, the end is coming no way to save it




Caller: "So whassup, man?"
DJ: "Coolin', man."
C: "Chillin' chilin'? Yo, you know I had to call, you why right?"
DJ: "Why?"
C: "Because, you, I never ever call and ask you to play somethin', right?"
DJ: "Yeah."
C: "You know what I wanna hear, right?"
DJ: "Whatchu wanna hear?"
C: "I wanna hear that Wu-Tang joint."
DJ: "Wu-Tang again?"
C: "Ah yeah, again and again."


I smoke on the mic like "Smokin' Joe" Frazier
The hell-raiser, raisin' hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider-Man
So uhh, tick tock and keep tickin'
While I get you flippin' off the shit that I'm kickin'
The Lone Ranger, code red: Danger
Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart
The vandal too hot to handle
You battle, you're sayin' goodbye like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspectah Deck's on the set
The Rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal


The way I make the crowd go wild
Sit back, relax, won't smile
Rae got it goin' on, pal
Call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat
Blow up your project, then take all your assets
'Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, go flip on the next man
'Cause I grab the clip and
Hit you with 16 shots and more, I got
Goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh


It's the Method Man, for short Mr. Mef
Movin' on your left, UH!
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break, fool, cock me back
Small change, they puttin' shame in the game
I take aim and blow the nigga out the frame
And like Fame my style will live forever
Niggas crossin' over, but they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a "Suuu"?
Nuff respect due to the 1-6-oooh
I mean ohhh, yo, check out the flow
Like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off, because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt make me *cough*


Ooh, what, grab my nut, get screwed
Oww, here comes my Shaolin style
True B-A-ba-B-Y-U
To my crew with a "Suuuuuuu"


C'mon, baby baby, c'mon, baby baby
C'mon, baby baby, c'mon


Yo, you best protect ya neck


First things first, man, you're fuckin' with the worst
I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a fuckin' nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zu
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down, that shit is packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin'
Ason Unique rollin' with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
Bite my style, I'll bite your motherfuckin' ass


For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
There's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats; if Rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stompin' grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin' star
'Cause who I are is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar
Point-blank as I kick the square biz
There it is, you're fuckin' with pros, and there it goes


Yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that
It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feelin' mad hostile, wearin' Aropostale
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy robe, then attack the globe
With the buck-us style, the ruckus
Ten times ten men committin' mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums
(He'll be) comin' around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one down
Ju-Jugger-Genius, take us the fuck outta here


The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap
That's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact, bring out the girls, and let's have a mud fight!


You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck




Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to welcome to you
All the way from the slums of Shaolin
Special uninvited guests
Came in through the back door
Ladies and gentlemen, it's them!


Dance with the mantis, note the slim chances
Chant this anthem, swing like Pete Sampras
Taking it straight to Big Man On Campus
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Scandalous, made the metro panic
Cause static with or without the automatic
And while I'm at it, yo, you got cash, pass it
It's drastic, gotta send half to Dirty Bastard


Waves is spinning, blades is spinning
Slay em in the eighth inning
Stay truck, god stay playing linen
Kill rap, observe the uptowns, ho, feel that
Mink jeans on, seen where the real at
2000 Zitos, moving with a ill ego
For real, for real, ill lines, ill people
Yo, bring it back, 9 more civilians
Pollying deals, monopoly and bills, y'all niggas lying
Caught 300, lab look royal wit a mean stomach
Go broke, all seen, done it
Words from the heavy set, if I don't eat, then we already met
Fly ass bro, liver than coke


Now what Clan you know with lines this ill?
Bust shots at Big Ben like we got time to kill
Niggas can't gel or I'm just too high to tell
Put on my gasoline boots and walk through Hell
With 9 generals, 9 ninjas in your video
9 milli blow, semi-auto with no serial
Man metaphysical, I speak for criminals
Who don't pay they bills on time and fuck with digital
Never seen, smoke a bag of evergreen
My sword got a Jones, more heads for the severing
Johnny in the dungeon, taking all bets, throw ya ones in
Scared money don't make money, throw ya guns in


That's word to Damo, San Juan, Puerto Rico
Blowin hydro on a beach wit Tamiko
My gun bullet hollow for you to swallow
Blowin' the nozzle, hear it whistle
One in the head, this is code red, man for dead
X amount of lead spray from the barrel
Heat clear the street like Connor O'Carroll
Fully equipped, rifles, banana clip shit
To make my niggas from East New York flip


Yo, you may catch me in a pair of Polo Skipperys, matching cap
Razor blades in my gums (BOBBY!)
You may catch me in yellow Havana Joe's goose jumper
And my phaser off stun (BOBBY!)
Y'all might just catch me in the park playin' chess, studyin' math
Signin 7 and a sun (BOBBY!)
But you won't catch me without the ratchet, in the joint
Smoked out, dead broke or off point (BOBBY!)


Wallo's comfortable, chocolate frosting
Your socks hangin' out, yours is talkin'
Rock so steadily, son, I'm still crazy
Sport my old Force MD furs from the 80's
Nat Turners wit burners, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Taught y'all niggas how to rap, reimburse me
Rothsdale's, ruby red sales, Bloomingdale's, blocks
Ox tails chopped up in Caribbean spots
I'm nice, maxed out, creepin' wit the ax out
Murder these bikini bitches, switchin with they backs out


Niggas wanna pop shit, I pop clips
Bitch, I'll put my dick on ya lips
Alabama split, hammer slay quick
That David Banner gamma ray shit
Shells in the mouth, jailhouse snitch
My powder voice, Snow White sniff
Verbal killas, gorilla grip
God body shit, puff Marley spliffs


You might see me in a 6, that's not my style
You might see me wit a bitch, that's not my child
I be in the benzo, keep a low profile
Dead serious, take flicks and don't smile
Tryin' to get money, y'all cats is wild
I pose for the clothes, make a song like wild
I'm a chip off the board game, got sword game
Live life to the fullest, still want more fame
Darts on layaway, beats on standby
Outfits pressed up, ready for airtime


Run on the track like Jesse Owens
Broke the record flowin', without any knowin'
That my wordplay run the 400 meter relay
It's on once I grab the baton from the DJ
A athlete wit his iron cleat in the ground
Wireless nigga who sprint off the gun sound
The best time yet still 7.0
Swift flow made the cameramen clothes blow




You are now in the special operating area of the studio...


I'mma push it to the limit like Manny and Tone
Like, somebody carry him home, deeper than Barry's tone
My young one, heir to the throne
I fuck it up, you be hearing the moans
Feeling the jones, dude do it smooth as kaluha
And you thought you was the future, you was the loser
Me, I'mma doolah schooler
This just use your manuever
I'm cool as the cooler, with the heart of a champ
So to fail's not part of the plan, I just started to dance
King of pop, moonwalking they ass
Getting dirty like water to sand, man, pump up the jam
Cuz the track's Godzilla
Way beyond monster, half bar killer
Charged with crash bar, smash ya'll iller
Camouflage large, hard head, Park Hilla, ahh


You are now in the special operating area of the studio...


Yeah, I'm wild like Clifton Powell, grammar tight
Like Vanna White hands, how I flip the vowel
Give it up, son, lift your towel, you're like a pitch
Just missed off the bat, I'mma hit you foul
Just bow when you face the great, ya'll skating on
Thin ice, or INS raise the stakes
Fuck around I'mma name your stage, Undadogz run the yard
AKA Doomsday Brigade
I say, I am not a gangsta, I am not a rapper
But nigga my response, shots flying at your Jaguar
Snitching in your song, stop lying bout your swagger
Popping shit now, hear him crying bout it after
I'm a different cloth from them, when I toss the blend
Heads spin like Porshe rims
What I talk, should of caused a trend, when I scope the lens
I got the whole world wanting in


You are now in the special operating area of the studio...




The niggas commercial...
Fuck outta here, you know where we came from
Word? Word up... nigga don't wanna shadowbox this, son
Right, right, right... yeah, wheelie in one hand
Right, you know it God, check the tale of the tape
Tale of the tape, yo, son, yo, son, yo


This Alaskan nigga approached me, he had suede on
Caesar head half moon, had his weight on
Five sixty drop, rest in Barbados
Stacked potatos, like he rich shit, have Play-Doh
What's your name? Louis Rich the Third
Back your herb, half of that, kid, polly your bird
Now we speakin', took off my hat, waves leaking
Beat your beak, he acting like he know about reef'
He still unsure, other than that, feel more than safe
Let money fake, I got three, for his hate
That more up, thought a nigga would front and fold up
Threw a medallion out, rocks all rolled up
Whose your beagles, money grabbing his gin
Puffin' illegal, that's chico, yo, what up with Rico?
He's chilling, plan status, nigga with that rams had
Check the stands, then check where his hands at
Jewels is gorgeous, priceless shit that's foolish
Fifteen, thousand in the trunk, he asked for Louis
Cat reached, grabbed his burner, shots'll lease
Like a new Sable, yo, except one touch the God niece
Emotional, throwing up shots like they promotional
Shorty run for the door, hit the floor composable
Stop playing, banging on the door, jakes laying
Something crazy, he had a eighty in the cab BM


Stay still kid, them niggas over there, want drama
Hold your head, sorta like Wu vs. Llama
Rap pehito, salute them niggas who got shit
Calico pop shit, rap burglar rock shit


You bein watched like you new on the block, from roof tops
Get your bruise on, it's hot shots, pop, music stops
Party's over, bold soldier move for his holster
Shot the lights out, struck the bouncer in his shoulder
Hard times for po-9, they can't control the masses, scream for Wu
Backstage, we slingin' V.I.P. passes
Jakes sprayin mace, riots be takin place
When the Clan show they face, the fans slow they place
Get your blunt rolled, fuck the 5-0, they want it dun' know
Bitches gettin' trampled, niggas wildin the front row
Fire marshall catch a beat down, tryin to cut my sound
Radio dispatcher, back-up, bustin rounds
Without intermission from a crouched position
Bullets ricochet off the strobe-lights, strikin Christians
My nigga slipped in, 'nuff ammunition, to bust back
Fuck that, them out-of-town cats'll take the rap
It's war on the dance floor, quarter to 4
Before we peeled off, they tried to seal off the back door
Gats for the beast, high persuit down the side streets
Shot up my getaway Jeep, crashed the front glass
And blew the head rest off the passenger seat
I grabbed the heat, ditched the whip and then escaped on feet
While the locals interrogated for names and photos
Work with 5-0, swappin info for dough




What, what, from here to Indianapolis...




Aiyo, INS, yo, these niggas talking real stupid, again
Nigga, you know what it is, nigga
How you gonna stop the real, nigga? It's impossible
Nigga, fuck is wrong with you niggas, is you stupid or something, let's go


Aiyo, go against House Gang and handle the war
In the streets we ain't asking who you handling for
Wave my hand have you faggot niggas hugging the floor
Scarface, shower scene, Angel blood and the chainsaw
Shells hit your car, tear your frame off
Beef got you covered like the faggot niggas, bodies in steak sauce
What you think I brough all these lions and apes for
Shotgun pele timey, dumping your face boy
Baby, it's a jungle, I got animal taste for
Real estate cards, plus keeping my safe full
La Banga, Donnie Cash, I'm catching a case for
Duct tape your face, then, empty your safe off
Soldiers got more than 8 balls, you just a running back
Play the front line with handoffs
Carlton Fisk, ready for the stand off
Five hundred grams, half a man, watch me get that man off


Real shit, we tryiing to get a mil quick
Son try and block the shots, right after the steel clip
Click, go and get your clique, crews, squads, bring 'em through
I'm so soulful, flow like a singer do
So bitches love me, I live like a swinger too
Niggas scared to play in the game, I brought some ringers through
Go ahead, say my name, the type to look for drama
I snatch your chain, test out your body armor
My reputation like Jeffrey Dahmer, I eat niggas
You running with rappers, I get money with street niggas
I put fire to leech niggas, gasoline homey with cheap liquor
Burn unit see the picture
C.S.I., S.I., chief retire
Rest in peace La, cut 'em like a pizza pie
I need paper, cop cars I don't even drive
I am not a rapper, nah, I don't even rhyme
Just speak true life stories, that's on format
So I use these fake ass rappers like they was doormats
Taylor put in work, no W-2's
So I don't file taxes, I just hustle my way through


I'm the real real...
I'm the real real...
I'm the real real...
I'm the real real...


Born with the struggle, used to hustle for crums
Filling blunts in the building front, thugging for ones
Full clips fly, nicks, dimes, something to pump
Whole clips fly, whips, dimes, nothing to son
City boy on the corner, I was so involved
So the drama, I embraced it with open arms
I'm trying to shake the fame, hoping I can break the change
Everyday the same, who am I to make a chance
When my niggas risk it all just to play the game
And the youngings going through it, trying to play the same
Through the rain, through the fire, handcuffed by desire
Cynthia son, forgive me for the sins that I've done




Stop the real, really? You only feel me if you walk the same road
Talk the same code
Still dwelling in the hell, and find a time to make a home
The few who escaped with trying to find a safer zone
I ain't waiting for Obama, never doubted him, I"m proud of him
He real, he'll spend a couple mil in the housing then
Seeing is believing, my vision is blurred
Cuz I ain't seen nothing I heard, really nothing but words
The bottom line, I'm still stuck to the curb
Sky high, but it wasn't the sherm, really nothing but herbs
I risk it all for the cause
Even if it's war, with the law, I won't pause
I can't, won't, don't stop, I ain't got an off switch
Dying trying to live it, just to get a small part of it
My squad is sick type, that you don't want problems with
Rolling like seventy mack trucks, what's stopping it?




You gots to be kidding my niggas, I worked too hard
Fought too long, I'm standing on my own two




Oh, Killah Hill, Killah Killa Hill
Killah Hill, Killah Killah Hill
Killah Hill, Killah Killah Hill
10304 style, kid
For my D.M.D. Rec posse niggas
You out there? Is you out there?

I throw your brain in the cobra clutch, behold the rush
A dazzlin display if you could get close enough
Cold Crush like the 4 stinger anaconda
Fierce darts that'll pierce through solid armor
Lounge in the barracks with Blue and Cappadonna
Spiderman identity Peter Parker
Crowd pleaser register off the meter
Vocal street sweeper bucks shots through the speaker
Pleasure seekers, 50 thou' in the stands
True fans get it hot like Jamaica sands
Conquer land, wide like a eagle wingspan
Clansman stabbin the track with both hands
Not a lost soul who falls for fool's gold
I shine like a diamond in the true state of cold
Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
Rap with a road block, I might lose control
Hold the globe in my iron palm
One hand holds the firearm on a mission that's life long
Strike calm through the fire like Chaka Khan
World wide on the web without the dot com


Killa Bees live in the place be
Burn third degree on the M-I-C
So deadly goes the catastrophe
And this is the way we crash the party
Say

Yo, Killa Bees swarmin, Protect Ya Neck!
What's the warnin? So, proceed with caution
I walk with my swordsmen, we all in together
Wu-Tang forever gon' win
From Puerto Rico 'cross the caves of Berlin
Echoin through cell blocks and federal pens
It be the Wu-Tang, you came in when
They left the game mentally and physically bent
What I invent, sharp as bardwire fence
I represent, sure to make a grand entrance
With the deadly lecture, contents under pressure
Inspectah, put your rep in the stretcher
Feather weight contenders surrender
T.K.O., first round knockout, vets to big spenders
Journey on the mic like Marco Polo
Internal bleedin occurs to your photo
Thoughts brought forth as wild as up north
It's bloodsport, get rushed for tough talk
But I hold my ground like it's high noon
While police tapes surround the mic room
I jump on a live tune, provide the boom
Those who consume become faint from the fumes





(Inspectah Deck)
Oh, Killah Hill, Killah Killa Hill

Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
Rap with a road block, I might lose control

One hand holds the firearm on a mission that's life long
Strike calm through the fire like Chaka Khan

T.K.O., first round knockout, vex the big spenders
Journey on the mic like Marco Polo
Internal bleedin occurs to your photo
Thoughts brought forth as wild as up north
It's bloodsport, get rushed for tough talk
But I hold my ground like it's high noon
While police tapes surround the mic room
I jump on a live tune, provide the boom
Those who consume become faint from the fumes

(Chorus)




Red Alert, Red Alert!
Red Alert, Red Alert!
Red Alert, Red Alert!
Red Alert, Red Alert!


Im way ahead of rappers, like where they used to keep the rock cassettes
I got a leg up like how Cool J used to rock his sweats
Lets see, Im the killer youre the victim
We both got a way with words Im just iller when I spit them
Pew Pew, Churches benches
Clap clap, all you hear, all you fear
Im kinda sick so I took this verse off
But Im kinda in charge of the fucking project
So they can't take this verse off
First off youre nerf soft, hang it up tyke
Fuck Seamus up? Yeah right
Its that high-end shit, I must be on another level
Like Im at Macys and cant find the mens shit
I leave a new emcee shaking
Hoppin out the whip the same color as gluten free bacon
I got that gluten-free, I got that gluten-free
"Yo hold the fuck up! Gluten free? You aint got no celiac disease!"
You all about frontin you aint been on the road
The only real tour (Realtor) you ever dealt with is house hunting
Czarface persona, drunk off that Jameson
On my J.Jonah and Im out




Professor X calling! Red Alert! Red Alert!
Mayday! Mayday!
Hurry! The Professor needs us!
But who dare threaten us now?
Czarface!
Im sorry to bother you
But something has come up that I thought youd want to know about
What is it Hans?
Somethings wrong with the kids


Broadcasting live out the kitchen like a cooking show
Cake boss, they open off of cookie dough
I see em looking though, Im on A-Plus
Game tough, clutch performer and my names up
You puff that plain stuff, I hit that sour power
Might've hit that white girl but I aint bout no powder
Clash with the titans who blast with the license
To kill, for real thats why they icing my grill
Dont deny what Im reciting is ill
Not saying Im the greatest alive, only time will reveal
I lean em in the dope fiend, fire provider
Light up the whole scene, sinister spitter did it for no cream
My line-up the finest just like a pro team
From the bottom Ive risen, living the life most dream
They smiling in your face but the hates strong
So I ram it in their face like Jake Long






RZA came and got me, this what I came to do, come on
Ring the bell so it's time to eat
Brick Dog stash weed inta AMI-seats
Bomb inside the palm
Doc rock a wifebeater with me beatin my wife ass ironed on
The front with my pump built like the Klumps
To carry it I take the spare out the trunk
I stay hungry, I ain't worked for days
That's why you see the pump when the curtains raise
Blast! Don't panic
Do I gotta explain how I tame and lock the rapgame single-handed?
Hell nah! I won't tell you son
If I find a wack ID I sell you one
Doc and Hot Nick, Inspectah
My lecture's like Hannibal Lector's
Where's the ketchup?
Don't speak on it, shut ya trap
I see ya whole crew yellow like mustardpacks
Ah woo, Doc in my own zone
You say you got the rapgames sewn, but it's sewn wrong
I ride through ya hood in a Mr. Softee truck
Then pull a mac out a box of snow cones
Yeah, ya little fucks
Gimme ya fucking money!

*Shout-outs from Raekwon and Ghostface*


Uhuh, check it
I'm hotter than a hundred degrees with my coat on
Playing with a dynamitestick, where did I go wrong?
Somebody pull the fire along when Jonny stomp
If ya lukewarm leavin ya clothes and boots torn
Pro's and con's, megabomb's and so-on's
By arid actions try MC's to get their roll on
First issue got issues
What is hip-hop to Hot Nickles?
It's like Funk Doc to snot tissues, word
Look at my hand and get the third
Finger out ya earhole like: Fuck what you hear
Now that's what I call hardcore, let's act fool
Mr. Fix-It like Handyman I pack tool
I been shitty, I'm from the bowels of the city (New York)
And just because my outfit match don't make me pretty
Baggy dungarees, dick need room to breathe
In a room full of crackers I might cut the cheese
Ain't no rules to the game, if it is we ain't playin
In your business like EPMD, "So What Cha Sayin'"
You co-signin that bullshit yo man tryin
Chaka chaka cha-ta tatat!!
Slugs flyin

*Shout-outs from Raekwon, Ghostface and Inspectah Deck*


Yo, ya
Check, the code echos from magazines to the big screen
Fo' wheel machines like ya wits scream
Kids fiend from the urban to sub-urban
Roll upon me thirstin like: Hey, hey, Mister Dream-Merchant
We roll longer than dice in a casino
Cee-lo in the 4, 5 or 6 with double 0
Behind the tinted windows I lay low
On some hydro tryin to slide from the 5-0
But now I get wild similar to Ol' Dirty
A third time felon just hit with over 30
No worries, style have em so thirsty
First degree heats are quittin on me
Cold turkey, no mercy
I bring the pain of a hundred migraines
But a thousand shoutin my name that's why I came
But first bring the cashburst, then the outburst
My surround sound pound ya ear like Jevon Kearse
I flex muscle outside I find a next hustle
Trouble with ya here and face the TEC-muscle
Even the best buckle win
I take it to the extreme
It gets ugly, but it's what a nigga do to get C.R.E.A.M
This life

*Shout-outs from Raekwon and Ghostface*



If it's possible I'll step in your obstacles


Oh shit you better watch out for this
Revenge so sweet that you might wanna flip
Ride on your enemies, bust they shit
Throw away the pistols throw away the clips


Big grits, big ox snatch ice at Woodstock
Remember those kids that hold cries they runnin fast
Crack spillin out they sides
It's the Hill brothers that kill
And raps on a blue trap water bugs nothin but thugs
Cops circlin, two cuts on shorty mugged
Streets turn by the flyest of bug
It's switch the e-shit fucker
I take rhymes like a piss
Eat the beats like tuna fish
Stay focussed, your camp is dead meat and drop worms
Wu-Tang is up on it too big to back down
Defeat never heard of I came with the crowd merger
The super friends seek that revenge
Bout to fuck out, you kiss girls on the mouth
Over here all of my niggas is bout bout




Call me straight up oak y'all niggas just plain panel
Guns from my Ceridoor ask mic ammo
Cross fire, bullets racashe horizontal
Brooklyn bridge pharazano niggas know the motto
Follow the path, knowledge the craft
Swallow a whole bottle of math
Since biology class
Grand achery, bow and arrow split your grand largely
Afro in ya heads, robin hoods drop goods in these wild lands
A desert eagle in a child's hands
Your style's planned, my styles blend earth, wind, fire, water
You never know my son might fuck Mariah's daughter
Ill visions of victory without a battle
Breathes through tracks like cold winds towards Seattle
Sound travels through fiber optics under gravel
Combinating six sixty and they try to handle
Niggas try to handle




Yo we always had a eight on us
Cold hands slingin niggas gotta pay on us
Co-froze our whole shit so you can skate on us
Niggas don't freeze long, start to rain on us
I'm the type tah hold the mac with one hand
Squeez that shit till the gun jam
Flow sickly rhyme swettin I'm too ill
Get blown quickly for two mills
Ice pick ain't too real sing your nice six swing to kill
Who runnin with the kid that brang me the pill?
Who runnin with the kid I'm like stainless steel
Frail nigga on some high and might, break your grill
Showtime there's a joke time I poll on the box
Poke lots of little holes in you like four little dots
Become my doja and baloon swallow them rocks
Shit out my profit hole by tommorrow you drop




There's a place out there where the enemies lurk
In the woods try to burn down mamma's church
No love, they came to spread hate
The angels floried inside the pearl gates
The world got dark, a earthquake
Trembled the underneath of the feet of pedestrians
Rain, drops fire and snowflakes
Destroy homes that contain the mad evil
All of God's children ran towards the ???
For all of those who did wrong to the ???
Their souls were cast out into the deep
Bodies of the unholy covered the street
And all of God's creatures ate them like meat
Oh father have mercy on the weak
The ones that can't see and the ones that can't speak
The ones in the projects smokin that leaf
Who lived through slavery, families got beat
Bit by the dogs, shot by the police
Screaming for justice, screaming for peace
Brothers behind bars fighting with the beast
Third world countries plus the Mid East
We all gon die if the battles don't cease

 X4




Leave my spinach in here, man, yo
I came to bring the pain, hardcore from the brain
And damage your mind like bad cocaine
The flamethrower started the game, it's game over
I Holly Holm's rappers while signing your bae's poster
I'm way colder, you need gloves tryna touch the kid
The Terminator with the flow, let nothing live
Voice shining, you could hardly steer
Like a judge, been handing out bars for years
Yeah, the team make cream while you daydream
Futuristic, our names up in laser beams
I make a scene on Broadway in broad day
24/7 365, man, I'm all day
Get it right, sir, I global mogul
Flex superpower like I changed in a phone booth




Yo money grip money grip, yo, this ain't no ego trip
This be a slaughter, I raise it up on the ego tip
Report to the battle booth
CZARFACE goes for more than blue Snaggletooth
A living weapon, I stay and step with the people
They accept me as regal, so may I sketch on the easel
And paint a picture of evil
I'm going through a splatter phase
I'm watching Peter Jackson Dead Alive Saturday
I got the drive of Allen I. with the mind of Albert Ein
Wildest rhymes, treat you like Hammer Greg Valentine
Rappers said they want beef, yelling from the side of lines
You don't really want shit, son, you a child of mine
No GNR, but I slash you like the lead guitar
He is odd, leaving people scarred like keying cars
Stop your motion like Jason and the Argonauts
Ray Harry how I'm housing in the parking lot
Rap whiter, track writer, rap writer around your neck
I fuck up Superman like Zack Snyder on the set
(Don't you ever forget)
Save the drama for your mama
'Cause your favorite rapper's rocking CZARFACE pajamas


Want her off Instagram and in bed? Score big and send the lover in your life the exclusive CZARFACE pajamagram. Fabric guaranteed to be softer than a *burp* purrs. With a 900 thread count to make the head count. Also available, the CZARFACE hoodie footies from silver age




"You are nothing..."
"...brothers, there's only one thing that I'd just like to mention
These two gentlemen, they are the wildest, as they look
The greatest there is today"


We confess, we the best
And we speaking from the eagle's nest
High atop, get your soul repossessed
No Kia, these women be blowin' up my Nokia
Double axe-handle, Randy Savage, oh yeah
You don't want to test the duo
I've been blessed with a jewel
I am destined to rule with heat on deck
Like INS with a tool, here's a cup for the drool
I'm a super villain, illin, call me Ra's al Ghul
Who is Bruce Wayne, hey man, cool chain
I train with Shaolin monks, no Liu Kang
I could rhyme that with the clan's first two names, Wu-Tang
Fuck it, I did it, now I gotta spit acidic
You can find me with the bully breeds
Something 'bout their teeth
Their proclivity for beef
The way they tear their arms off a thief
Each line's dope, call it cash flow
If it's seeming like it's art, let's start with Dash Snow


Cane Corso you dealing with a rock beast
Nothing iller, this is Godzilla unleashed
Canine teeth, yo yo yo yo
Nah you don't want beef, yo yo yo yo
Cane Corso you dealing with a rock beast
Nothing iller, this is Godzilla unleashed
Hulk rap, out for the green
Gamma-ray grammar, banner here for the team


I'm a beast when the flame is sparked
Guaranteed I bring heat, similar to Wade, James and Bosh
Novacaine flow, fiends'll nod
I put my hands in ya pocket, peel off and G your broad
All aboard, real G's applaud
I'm a stand up nigga, go down what we feel is ours
Boss man got checks to cash, any threats to the set
Got vets that'll stretch ya fast
I'm fresh like the produce section, no use heckling
Drama, and my whole crew step in
I'm on money like the president face
In the jungle, slit throats of several snakes
And I'm sick with the medical case, so cold, frigid
Unless you live it, you can never relate
I was thinking you be on by now
Same time, you was thinking I'd be gone by now
Stupid
INS ya highness
AKA B52, Joe Lew, the brown bomber
Wear your armor


Cane Corso you dealing with a rock beast
Nothing iller, this is Godzilla unleashed
Canine teeth, yo yo yo yo
Nah you don't want beef, yo yo yo yo
Cane Corso you dealing with a rock beast
Nothing iller, this is Godzilla unleashed
Hulk rap, out for the green
Gamma-ray grammar, banner here for the team


"I'll stay with you. Just in case The Ghost decides to put in an appearance while my friends here are gone."
"Let's go!"
"Can the Super Friends find the right super powers to subdue the unseen specter that's terrifying the metropolis?
Watch as they meet: The Ghost"




Aiyo, Rockstars, bases and capers flying through cases
With placed bread, lead blowing through domes, scalped faces
Moving through towns, skama lit, nations bend stations
Dope fiend Asians, smoke cream vanquishes
The town is thirsty for work, blood hurting
Flash the curtain, open, I'm scoping, Hutch and his team
Clutching Dutches Backwoods, other shits working, not perfect
Flipping discussions, cussing all froze with slush, kid
Lacer had the drop, pass the Glock, Woosie uzi
The car hard bluesy with the pay me mean 'Bach
Cream shot, clean slot, one in his dome, four shock
He partially zoned, his dome fell on the rock
His face dazzle, niggas baffle, son, hit the floor, he traveled
Yo, to a new land, I cracked his cerebellum
Wide open, open the crowd up, he fouled up, black laid in the hall
For like forty-five to an hour, soaking


Sound of the smoking barrel, live like them older stars
Scrooge like a Christmas Carol, stemmed from a bloody love
Shot through the old apparel, no police to respond
Dropped off the Verrazano, washed up On Golden Pond
Just like a Shakespeare novel, more problems to dissolve
If this is destiny, that's how this world revolves


Aiyo, it's real, better pop your steel
Cop those wheels, shop those deals
Full time with the grind for a meal
Stay down low like O'Neal
Rain, hail, snow or shine, put time on the field
Police ride on my heels
Still big time, big dime, how you feel
I rhyme but the nine stay peel
I, zone on roam, floss with the chrome on chrome
Host on the corner store
S.I.N.Y. on my own, it gets foul, but I call it home
Live red bone give me dome, champagne toast to Tone
Roll a bone, a homegrown with Capone
Cause more rips to the o-zone, wanna ride with a nigga then hold on


The place was very smokey and cloudy, the full lousy
Music was emotional, people vibes was laid back and far from rowdy
She sit at the bar, holding a glass, sipping on a drink
Tears flowing like water from a sink, her eyes never blink
Her cigarette was burnt to the butt, her wrist was wearing a cut
Her facial expression was saying "now what"
Another drink was made, each and every time the bass was played
Bartender telling her to go, but then she only stayed
Riding on the borderline, between homicidal, suicidal
Just hours from the headlines, the story with the grim title
She questioned her reason for being here, but even with
Four kids at home alone, it still remains unclear
Opens up a bottle of prescribed drugs and grabs a mug
Down, every one of those pills, since she was feeling bugged
Kinda weak, she stumbled from her seat, but she will never return
I guess it must of been a, lesson to learn






Coach, put me in the game
I'm for real, for them peoples tryna to put me in them chains
Whatever the topic, let's put it in the frame
We can even load it and cock it and put it in they brains
I'm saying, some rappers do it for a chain
Kill yourself, I know killers that'll do it for some change
These veterans is slipping, they ain't doing it the same
I don't slip, set a pick and put a shooter in your lane
Precise, 'bout shoot them at the range
But I ain't tryna shoot it with you rappers
I'll just shoot it at your dame
Y'all never should have threw me in the game
Found a new word for weed, that was so mean
I threw it in my name


My song banging loud on the block like arms spraying
The law hating, warring like Blacks and Caucasians
God versus Satan, I'm laying in the dark
With the Mossberg waiting, letting off first basing
Slim from the cotton club washing a scrub
Deuce high when he cruise by, spotting his love
Hold the mic like a .38 muzzle to snub
This flow, call it OJ blood on the glove
Above rap, capital Gs speak on the facts
Please believe that, meaning that I keep it a stack
He's back, he a beast on the track
The only time that I go soft is probably with your freak in the sack
Feel the bass make sure he shake, murder verse, first forty-eight
Manslaughter, nearly caught a case
I crack heads more than base
Stack bread when I orchestrate, that said y'all the bass


No matter what the weather, we be getting our cheddar
So we can have a better tomorrow
Oh, money, cars, superstars, getting ours, working hard
For a better tomorrow


I seen niggas sniff coke through a crazy straw
Come out they shirts sweating bullets with the Bobby Brown jaw
Dry mouth, grinding back and forth plus he's steaming a Newport
We all holding the torch
Few staircase murders, some burners don't blam right
Guns that kicked around the wall you better stand tight
Full of X, AKs, whiling in lobbys, bulletproof PJs
Fuck around and get spunned like the DJ
CSI traumatized by viewing the instant replay
SpongeBob niggas get scars nigga
I'm off style in any section of the hood I'll pull your car nigga


No matter what the weather, we be getting our cheddar
So we can have a better tomorrow
Oh, money, cars, superstars, getting ours, working hard
For a better tomorrow


See ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
So you rather pursue death than admit defeat
See ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
So you rather pursue death than admit defeat


I used to be so narcissistic, park the whip and spark the biscuits
Spit hollow tipped shells at the Narcs with quickness
Live to tell the tale cause only God's my witness
Been a long time, change gonna come son, I'm optimistic
I hold the steel like Ron O'Neal
Super fly, do or die, Killah Hill, Brownsville
Never ran, never will, yes I can, yes I will
Put a dot upon your knot then I drill through your grill
Like a dentist, my apprentice speaks with a vengeance
Demented scientists count bodies inside the trenches
That's judges off the benches, got inches for y'all wenches
We plant those hot seeds that grow in cold winters


No matter what the weather, we be getting our cheddar
So we can have a better tomorrow
Oh, money, cars, superstars, getting ours, working hard
For a better tomorrow


See ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
So you rather pursue death than admit defeat
See ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
So you rather pursue death than admit defeat






Huh, after all these years, what you said was true
The Shaolin and the Wu-Tang is very dangerous

Hahahahahah


It's the ODB kid, once again coming through your area
And I'm going to tell you one time, you gon' love this


I had to get the money, said it wasn't a choice
Die Hard's on the bars, Ladies lovin' the voice
Morphine flow, numbing your joints
Bomb a nigga like he number 81 from Detroit
Zombie life, World War Z
Antidote to your virus, your highness, the world on me
Capital G, cool as the dude from Dos Equis
So deadly, I don't make it rain, I snow heavy
Sick lane, Nic Cage how I ride with fire
Forever with bars, sort of like a lifer
With the son of anarchy, I be breaking bad
Walking dead, day dreaming of making a band
Dancing with the stars, Americans idol me
The mentalist with the Big Bang Theory


Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


The most duplicated, anticipated, validated
Urban legends in the books with the ones who made it
Highly celebrated, everything was work related
Current top 40 got the Wu deep in all their business
20 years Killa Bees, yeah, we hold the pennant
Monumental stance on the cover with my co-defendants
Drop her sentence, in remembrance
Construct these jewels so they can live through my descendants


Youngun, I can see your draws, pull your pants up
Can't even call yourself a man until you man up
And if you call yourself a fan you need to stand up
This ain't a party, it's a jux, keep your hands up
And I don't care who runs the city when the summer come
Your summer's done, Wu forever, and we're still number one


Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


Picture a nigga on the strip getting rich off the drug shit
Putting other niggas on, teaching em thug shit
Then they want stick 'em up, then they get slugs quick
Hood-type niggas always living that crime life
Jealous-ass grimy niggas seeing the limelight
Slimy old nigga like fucking your mans wife
Fool shouldn't use the word brother, he man dyke


Yo, I spin my web all across New York
Get it out in all types of ice, there's a sport
One chain, two chain, three chain, four
Niggas mouth's drop like the leaves in the fall
Tone got that WBC
I take off heavy in air balloons and land in the Fiji's
That's my bird and that's my word
You faggots keep fucking around and get curbed
(I came to town)


Forms circles like the rings of Saturn
Dust rocks and ice in a particular pattern
Then this fascinating picture has emerged from surface
A wonder of the young world with an urgent purpose
A wild fire engulfing every home
It's history chiseled and carved in every stone
A workshop where skills are learned
Handcrafted and drafted, written works the main concern
Urban center provided with a social structure
And a curious culture full of superconductors
Each stain is part of a scene with
Intricate geometric raps on a larger screen
Spell bounding, marvelous and it's surrounding
Viewpoints remain the same, it's all astounding
A place where the forgotten art is so powerful
A striking image is something that's so valuable


This one's the blackout! Three-fifty-seven to your mouth!


GZA, this is called Ruckus In B Minor
Rae, all those bad times is behind us
Ghost, put that mask on to remind us
Method Man, let 'em know who's New York's finest


Youngun, I can see your draws, pull your pants up
Can't even call yourself a man until you man up
And if you call yourself a fan you need to stand up
This ain't a party, it's a jux, keep your hands up
And I don't care who runs the city when the summer come
Your summer's done, Wu forever, and we're still number one


Still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one


Now I'mma let all you motherfuckers know
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga
I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker!


My lines is like Peruvian coke, go ahead and try one
My recipe is A1 remarkable with my mixture
Rainman mathematician, this city slicker
The finest threads cover my frame, the cloths of royalty
Strive with an army of winners and no pretenders
(*One*) We live free and achieve more
But first we gotta win with no stalemate
The all eye seeing is victorious biz to the sound man


Armored trucks, tanks are bulletproof, been the truth
Loot the track, clear the booth, my thought ready, aim, shoot
My knowledge one twenty proof, let's tear the roof off
Let's spray, M-A-S-T-A
King I Love-Love club, pack stadium rock
I hold the mic snug, split a slug
Black ninja, mask and gloves


Still number one, still number one





All you hoes, be cryin for these bitches
All you niggas, be cryin for these hoes

Brothers that'll kill for the will of the righteous
Twenty-five to lifers, True and Livin' snipers
You wait like "Sixth Sense" 'til hard to kill


How you livin StreetLife? I'm surrounded by criminals
Serial killers tote guns without the serial
High-tech, street intellect, all digital

Uh
Imma f'kin like this, ha, ha, ha...
You already know
Peace to my brother Ghostface


Party people, welcome to the gathering
Many of you tonight have traveled for many miles
To hear the master of the art display styles and techniques
Now with this piece of steel that I hold so firmly
I conduct yall accordingly, one time for your mind
Authentically designed and crafted by the hand of god
Autograph, camera phones, flash as I enter
A glimpse of the ninja, rarely seen and heard
But his words so powerful, catch him at the show and prove
Building with Allah's son, who they talking bout, me?


Who they talking bout, who they talking bout, ahhh?
Who y'all talkin bout? Ah?
Who they talking bout, me?
Who they talking bout, you keep my mic in ya mouth


With beats so banging and, bass drum kicking and
Melody soulful strings are calling, it's like
Back against electrical fence, but Im a winner
My mic's like my only defense, brothers locked down
Aunties that changed my pampers, all sponsors
I wont fail the mission, with self knowledge guiding me
Nothing can contain me from seeing everything that's mine
Economically, nothing is given
We know steps are taken, people couldn't see it until it burst to existence
Brush the stardust from the sleeves of my jacket


Who they talking bout, who they talking bout
Who y'all talkin bout, who you talking bout?
Who they talking bout, me?
Who they talking bout, you keep my mic in ya mouth


See, this is how your rhyme gotta be young G
Im a writer not a rapper, emcee
Build-or-destroyer, some overstand, but I understand that
We are students to life, true divine order
Must be restored in order for us to live right
Yall stay chirping like birds, words travel
At the speed that Im slappin you
Ask you as the world revolves, caliente
Its about 100 degrees with no breeze, can you swim nine thousand?
I bench press hills and mountains from the highest peak
I fears no evil as I walk through the valley
Im like the father at the first rally, are you listening?




Countdown...


Are you ready? Are you mad inside?
Got you strapped down to your seats
Outta the doorway, bullets ripped, full clip
God speed, approach follow my lead
Fire winds gust, empire crush
Full thrust, fall in the hole, roll wit the rush
Untouchable chunk of earwax and soul
Sound waves slay out the bat cave smoke
My belly-full prance dance, avalanche quote
Down slope, elegant as Fantasia
Killer whale tale inhale, black male from Asia
All out the wood works, hood shirts and wizards
No match, unhatch, the rap is rigid
In the shaft, shotty cocked, hip hop to the limit
Nightwatch, pad mark
Sparks spin a quake nuclear blast, heavy on the cash
Gimmie what it takes NOW!!

Chorus  2x
RAGE ROCK ROLL FIGHT
BRAWL FALL RUMBLLLLLLEEE!!!


The diabolic witty, dialect's darker than Gotham City
With the possibility to stop your walkin ability
God forgive me, spark enemies with pistol grips
The missile tip's impact hit you so hard, you shit through your dick
Official scripts strikes when physical hits
You physical bitch, watch for the imperial blitz, serious shit
Submit, subject to the wreck war tone, and thought poems
Liver than WWF Warzone
Walk upon them Gotti tracks, bodies collapse
Rap for lottery stacks, shatter like when pottery cracks
Logical facts from the terror dome
Spill from the guts, trail to you ?puss? from where you bust
In God you now entrust
Dog you like hound and mutts, Pound Pups get sound struck
Clown what? You'll get drowned in the cut
While crowd round up

 (x2)


A-yo, yo;
I spit bars, travelling tremendous speed measuring far
Been busting satellites circling Mars
Verbal onslaught, bring forth physical force
Of a hundred wild niggas piled in a Trojan Horse
Thought method, set it on generic mic ethic
Professional neck shit, left foes beheaded
This music, is mind control like computer chips
Been doing this for numerous years, refuse to lose it
With turbo tactics, maneuver like a trained soldier
Hall of Fame flame thrower, take game, it's game over
Ayatollah, high roller nine totter
Mind controller, 2009 time folder
My coalition, bring the demolition
Wu-blade decision, slate the competition, wit no intermission
Spitting hazardous darts, up front like Rosa Parks
Makin million men march

 (x2)


Yo, who got next? Meth got next
I chin check, all these MC's line em up god, I go Jihad
Declare holy war, it be hard to dip and dodge
Police squads trying to bogard, we rip and rob
The boulevard ain't safe for your kids, that's how it is
In the ghetto, we ain't scared to death, but scared to live
So Goldy, mosey to the spot, get that moldy
Rusty-ass .38 Special, niggas owe me
Slowly I turn, face the one and only
Naughty By Nature, I Do My Dirt All By My Lonely
Ask Pretty Tony, when I got a bitch I keeps a bitch
36 Chambers, Enter at your own risk
Take that watch off and tuck your necklace
City never sleeps, streets is restless
Rap style'll slave you, when you least expect it
Pull the plug on your respirator, leave you breathless
Wu-Tang forever and a day, better warn your boys
I deploy battleship rap, seek and destroy

Chorus 2x




Visual, visual, JB
Yo, Ye, what up? Raekwon


You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened I was floating, you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dining in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, patent leather
Playing the field, trying to outslick Baretta


You see, my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going? That's what nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love


I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool, tryna be cool, what you expect me to do?
I'm just tryna find, find, find this sweet love of mine


I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love


Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said "Yo what's your occupation, crazy rhyming?"
Listen to Wu-Tang, trying suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon
Stunting in a high top Louis', shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
Next show they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rocking like this 16 years old
The hard drums and the Wally's something that caught me
I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rocking the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top, old school bumping to Cash Rules
No question we the reason why the summer's blazing
Then say, "You looking good fly coloured Asian"
Raw I give it to you, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia
Until she caught me getting numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love, sweet love of mine




Why can't I find you, love of mine?
When you're standing in front of my face
Oh why, I must be blind
How did I let you get away?


Leave it up to the most high, sitting in a ghost fly
Chilling with two of my brothers
We both live on deck grabbing 'em on set
This is how we roll in the business, she a go I'mma go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month baby girl, just call me up
Waking up resting in cold sweats
Thinking of this bitch, the videotapes, even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost, I know I'm going crazy, I can't floss
Me, my lady left my homies it's all baloney
Just like rocking the old Pony's
So when I'm chilling, I'm just lost no more feeling
I need my honey in my life get that feel me
Take your time, readjust and ya you shine
My runaway love didn't mind, come on






Moving around, moving around
Moving around, can't fall
Moving around, moving around
Moving around, can't fall


I bring an end to the weak, call me Saturday
Fast as Cassius Clay
I put your favorite rapper head in a glass display
I'm at the cabaret
Sitting with the baddest bitch sipping Cabernet
Nah, I didn't have to pay
Never trick for a treat, not even on Halloween
Fuck your Twitter, FB, and IG, I follow green
See the flow stay fogging your lens
Your boy like a paranoid jewel thief dropping 'em gems
Yeah, me and Eso like Deadpool and Spider-Man
We combined make a marvel at the fire jams
Try us, fam, you find yourself in a frying pan
We get your food regulated like a diet plan
Poisonous pen play, your sensei
Spitting this on a Wu Wednesday for 10K
My game's still a-wild, double up the pain now
The haters, they feel some type of way now


Moving around, moving around
Moving around, can't fall
Moving around, moving around
Moving around, can't fall


100 proof, I'm a wolf, Harvey Keitel
You out fronting about nothing like Seinfeld
I stay killing like Wade Wilson with nine's help
I spear with gravity, that'll be how the rhymes felt
It feels like a Vulcan mind melt with Liefeld
The new mutant is true to shooting, no dry spell
Make 'em all shake in their boots
Like strippers who making their loot
Amazing the brains, these rappers hate me, but praise me
So I'm kind of like Laettner and Duke
FN-2187 on you fake and that's true
Basically making me puke
Hank Pym, that's him, that's how his brain compute
CZARFACE equals so much more than the name of a group
We're talking vibranium shoes, weapons, Iranian nukes
Jedi  tripping save us flipping, they training with Luke
Ever since me and Deck been on that buddy-buddy shit
Shit been ugly, but it does the trick like Steph Curry kicks


Moving around, moving around
Moving around, can't fall
Moving around, moving around
Moving around, can't fall




"There!"
"Fancy looking fellow isn't he?"
"Wait a minute, I've seen him somewhere before..."
"A-ha!"


I'm sickly, flow quarantined by the CDC
Heads nod, pressure on your neck like a DDT
Beat Street Ramo, spittin' on your name
Rhymes travel underground like it's written on a train
My position in the game, top dog, rock hard
Fuck with everybody in your hood, just not y'all
Basic, live broadcast from the ER
We are talk of the town without the PR
Savagely attack this
Rap master craftsman
Pack em in, twisted on the floor like a backspin
After him, y'all will have to deal with the son of Deck
One of the best that hasn't done it yet
Killer Bee, chopping up the track like a Dilla beat
Professor X couldn't test my ability
I cave the motherfucking roof like heavy snow
Act like I told ya before
Y'all ready know


"Now an attack is made..."


E-S reps, I wrote this in a GS Lex '95
To get that nineties vibe
My melody, high and low fidelity darts
My whole team, 7:30 like when Jeopardy starts
I can't call it, unless we call my style diabolic
I'm a write-a-holic, I drink ink til I vomit
I think til I'm catatonic, in sync with a bag of chronic
I'm bringing the mad demonic style all these rappers wanted
I'm a tsar of bizzare bars, cut you like a scimitar
Wichita state, X-Man'll execute you, you a dead man
God willing
I'm an odd villain getting top billing, with my squad chilling
Blood on the tracks like Bob Dylan, die like a mob killing
We already know the ropes
We be stepping over ropes
It's Andre the Giant looking down at you local folks
Okey-doke, motorized vocals, yeah I practice
Raised on a tape the same color as Galactus


"Hello Mr. Ghost, we meet again, eh?"


Look out, attack like a nigga on bath salts
Eat his face off, leave his body on asphalt
Rampant, run through your town on attack mode
Savagely leave em broomstick'd in the asshole
Cobra clutch, ickiest stick to the dutch skin
Throw a mask on, and go in, go in
I'm a terror tuck a GEM/STAR in the New Era
Walk around with two bats like I'm Yogi Berra
Or Marv from Sin City rockin' robes as a trench
My two weapons black have you ducking under the bench
The stench of dead bodies, thoughts of the mutilation
Bring you closer to God in a tight situation
Or thrown in the back of the truck, a sanitation
I'm ruthless, my technique is Chinese torture
No IV's hanging out of your vein to support ya
Everybody's talking about how the ghost caught ya
Have a 5-year-old kill your ass for a quarter


"At Tony Stark's office, there is a new development..."
"Ironman...? Ironman...?
Red alert. Red alert."




You can't hack the tactics
Of a semi-automatic full rap fanatic
You can't hack the tactics
Of a semi-automatic full rap fanatic


I make mean lean when I pump my spunk
And hands of chump, of machine gun funk
I bliss, like the fist, of the mantis
Those who oppose get dropped and hit the canvas
With rigormor', I hit you in the core and
Pop your legs well in the figure four
You can't stop the force when the blood is coursin
Extortion, I'm comin like the headless horseman
Enforcin, tortureous slang from a fortune
Swordsman, throw your rap corpse in coffins
Don't pop Glocks at me then cop a plea
A hundred thousand leagues beneath the sea
Deep depths makes rappers salted
Weak rappers asses I cracks my foot, off in
Lay down them lines with them hard hits
And I'm harmin, bombin, with heavy bombardments
Pushin, poetry, like weed by the pounds
Underground railroad RZA track lay it down
I'm hard as pavement, you gaze from amazement
Knock you in the head you wonder where the days went
It's golden bangles, microphone getting strangled
Five-star general, scars you want to angle
Bizarre thriller, war scar for a killer
Sheisty mic device got my hand-piece throbbin
Slice mics precise on down to ice carvings

Chorus 2X


Yo
I set the mic in flames, bomb like fighter planes
MC's are shot down long range with sniper aim
No question marks, the session starts with sparks
My flows explodes like hand grenades through your parts
Universal soldier, MO's the holder
Globe in both hands, born to be sole controller
Hit the world full blast, my crime pays cash
Slip past C-cyphers and the flash from the photograph
Best-seller compose a rough draft
Razor Sharp vocabulary cut glass
Actual facts crowds of thousands collapse
You can't catch my style with bugs and phone taps
Whether rhymes or crimes, I want mines regardless
Hard targets, underground like black markets
Pirates of the darkest water feel the aura
Importer of rough raps that's snuck cross the border
Semi-automatic attack'll spray y'all
Liquid Sword swingin slay all, I'm AWOL

Chorus 1.5X


Wu-Tang be, killin you softly with this song
You won't survive the outcome I bring Def Jams to your eardrums
P.L.O. hits the hardest, regardless
Felony offenders catchin murder one charges
Open cases, got me smoked out in staircases
The dark crusader jackin cats in elevators
I strike back like the Jedi, from N.Y
It's I illifyin, dope rhyme supplyin
I be all you need to rock these mic devices
Projectile Shaolin style exiles your juvenile freestyle
I'm not your basic street entrepeneuer, crime tour, packs the luger
High pursuit for the CREAM like the Bodyguard from Bejing
Inject you with the morphine, then I flee the murder scene
On your facilities, the penalty, DOA
Bomb shell your burrow like Bombay
Opposites attack that's why these thieves stay strapped
As we, travel the globe to put Shaolin on the map
I show loyalty, to my fans fully
Operational raps, that bust through your skully
I'm rated second-to-none I be the top gun
From the land of the Slums spittin blades from my tongue
Park Hill slug slinger, hit you with the sleeper
Hit-seeker, sounds that be attackin your speaker
Watch me bang the headpiece kid there's no survival
My flow lights up the block like a homicidal
Murder, underground beef for the burger
P.L.O., criminal thoughts you never heard of




INS, your highness
He returns, the revolution, will not be televised
It will be taken to your front door
Brace yourself


It's the aura, don't break or take orders
I drink holy water, they follow me like the Torah
Getting tore up, for months, out in Europe
Deck told me, Term, you're up, don't curl up
We making cheddar out there, smoking on some leather couches
Stretching ounces, been about this bread, baking coke mountains
From Law Town to Staten, to Boston to Manhattan
This is what you call serious rappin'
The serial scratcher, murder materialism ratchet
Fearing the blackness, til your soul drift in where you passing
I gotta be a thug angel, smoking angel dust
Who can I trust, I'mma bust til my stainless rust
The devil harm me til my pillow soaking wet and steaming
I see the demons, they creeping in my biblical teaching
So just remember if I'm next to split, catch a clip
Catch a ditch that I wreck the shit with Inspectha Deck


"INS, your highness"
"Termanology"
"Planet Asia Medallions"
"Murder rap, spray at your dome"
"Serial scratcher, murder material"
"Murderous math"
"Catch a clip"
"My turn is right"
"Catch a clip"
"INS"
"Termanology"
"Planet Asia Medallions"
"This is what you call serious rappin'"


I'm cold blooded like Rick in his time, you can see me prime time
At the top spot, sitting with shine
I leave 'em froze like they sniffing a line, while they bitching and crying
You find me always in position to climb
I swing like Serena, hard as Medina, we can be the beast to
Keep mamacitas moy bonita
I breath ether, 103 fever
Spread through receivers, infect the true believers
Murder rap spray at your dome (Killers don't lurk there)
Killa likes hang up the phone
He a gangsta, claiming he bold, real loud with the crowd
But I doubt you can bang on your own
I earn my stripes, I burn for life, I turn your wife
My turn is right, you heard me right
I learn to fight, I work the night, I splurge the price
I swerve on bikes, my word, I"m nice




Yo, seen it all scenery, post-war poison taste basil
Meanwhile, casino we was gambling
Multi cigar scent drench, cake splashing
That's my alibi, to outfits flavors, so taste fashion
Handmade hankerchiefs, bottles popping but I don't drink
Fuck it, since we celebrating I'mma take a sip
Black down, couple of killas who never back down
Choppa clappa mack splash, burgendy backgrounds
And stiching a tradition that's passed down
Murderous math, watch me duffle bag a couple of stacks now
At the bottom with mean face, bottling anger
Til I got woken out of that dream state
Reality is a must, my doo-rag dynasty is to gold rush
Gold Chain Military's the soldiers
Low and behold us, the poisonous ring promoters of the cobra
Planet Asia Medallions, the fucking shogun

"Words don't help you" (x4)



Yo, I got sight beyond sight like the sword of Omen
Beats are left broken by the wise words spoken
Survive livin, driven by blood money hunger
Snakes lay, waitin impatiently to steal your thunder
We stay sharp, state-of-the-art, tear the stage apart
Razor Sharp poison darts raid the charts
Through the underground, some are found changin bounds
The gun sparks like the bloodhound and hunts ya down
The hood life, I'm in it to the limit
Wouldn't quit it for a digit, die for it cuz I live it
Before I let go, have correct dough
I Bust my shit off, I'm out to blow the lid off, alert the metro
I glow like a lazer lights show, your eyes squint
Vibrant, true colors, I move swift and silent
Livin by the day, hearts are cold like winter nights
Got a hot 10 on the dice in this game of life
A-alikes in tune, immune to snake bites
Roll like the blue coats with no lights, late night
Smooth criminal, born original on a lyrical high
Perform miracles before your 3rd eye
Sir I light up the round table
Lockin the king's crown, able to hold it down stable
Fatal tech 9's could make mines deadly duties
Fatal beauties seduce me, used by a hootie and the blowfish groupie
Unruley, fists of fury fly loosely
Cash still rules, ain't nothin new, tuck your jewellry

"Words don't help you" (x2)


Some sound-sound like they real top guns
But this a true sound, it's a champion
Rock the mic in every session
Reign number 1, no competition



Just when you thought it was safe
To make a name for yourself, the blows delf
You get stripped for your belt, run your garments
Feather-weights don't know what you involve in
Revolvin in fantasy, ya dilute the solvin
My hip hop quoted as an Uncontrolled Substance
Rough from the beginnin, whispered in my blood
Since my child days, blazed, workin on entery level
50 metal jackets are found, no sign of Rebel
The Iyatollah, Kenny Rogers in the game of high rollers
Side-kick, Lucky Hands the dice thrower
Amputate tracks, blow back the mic holder
Godlen ax blade come down, the mic's over
Takin flight in the Rover, nobel street soldier
Deep cover mission, rap spies be my folder
I.N.S. a.k.a. J. Hunter, vocal gunner
Known to choke-hold the funky drummer
Hunter city tour for the summer
The last dog, Wu Forever roar through your 4 runner
My all-star team put up Jordan-like numbers
Small wonder, get your welcome mats snatched up from under
Your cold feet, jacked your whole feat and mad a whole mil'
No frills with no skills and bounded to steal
This is real, Wu part 2 spark you
Reality bites with teeth marks like a shark do
Niggas dick-ride by the carpool, Gods rule
If I could own rocks, got me toxy at the bar stool
Me and my girl boost the underworld, duckin feds
Can't trace the blood of my swords, double-edged



"Words don't help you" (x4)


Nothin you sell, oh, oh...



"Who's the knucklehead wantin respect?" -- Ghostface



Yo, yo; Never doubt the Life
(EHHHH! YO!) Yo
Who the fuck are you to criticize me?
Yo, I slap, yo, I slap dick ta ya wifey
Yo (respect, that's my word)


Another Wu tradition, Street vision, listen
All my life I've been poverty stricken
Always took what's mines, never was given
A second chance just to rap sheet a bad decision
You can't knock the hustle or the life that I'm livin
Quick to stick the clip in, blow you out position
Street juridictions, nigga, no restriction
Concrete composition for emcee's in submission
Special edition crash course mission
Push through like the task force and crush all competition
See you from a distance, dry snitchin, whisperin
Greet your man posted up like two little bitches
When you get the heart, step live or catch stitches
Or find yourself with Del, sleepin with the fishes
I got no love for fans that's fake ass niggas
I can't stand the bid when it's all in my business
Wu-Tang Forever and a day, don't get it twisted
I get lifted, I just shoot somethin from hot buscuit
These street kids, we can't lost, we terrorize you district
Leave no finger prints and no survivin witness


Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
(Yo, yo Math!)
It's them kids from the otherside "Shaolin" Worldwide
Street Life, Homocide, nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide, boo, we P.L.O
Fo' sho', if it don't flow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it don't blow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it ain't dough, gotta go
Some didn't listen 'til my gun went BLOW!


Yo, thoughts sharper than a Japanese Kitana
Ninja coma, pirahnas crack teeth on my armor
Scadalous, I ran contra-bomber, stalker like rebels of Rwanda
Death before dishonor, snake charmer, persona of one who makes drama
Godfather 4 type saga, tuckin a revolver in my Parker
Bombin unprepared for departure, might talk but strike harder
Fear the bow of the silent archer
Sure shotter, pass the rock to your starter
Poison darter, news photographers document the horror
While I bounce Shaunda with Tiwana and I from blue Honda
Honorable scholar, rockwilder, rip mic's for top dollar
Your highnes, the crowd hollar
Got your head rock, feel the brain trauma
Crowd sponser, hotter than Bahama steam saunas
The Rebel of opera, popped off the choclate and the ?gosha?
Monster truck crush you imposters


Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
It's them kids from the otherside "Shaolin" Worldwide
I.N.S., Homocide, nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide, boo, we P.L.O
Fo' sho', if it don't flow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it don't blow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it ain't dough, gotta go
Some didn't listen 'til my gun went BLOW!


I'm the four mic emcee with five mic potential
Overlooked cuz y'all can't understand what I been thru
You ain't got to love me, or even pretend to
Actin like the street, they ain't got no street credentials
Crack villians, raps be killin instrumentals
The caps pealin and slap a feelin out ya dental
Underground, sound, for ghetto residentials
Up shit's creek lookin for some more shit to get into
Got the Clan jewels as I continue
To serve you everythin on that's on the menu
With Chef John Jacob
Remember Sunz Of Man told you Wake Up?
My nigga smell the coffee, I'm too hardcore to kill softly
Come to free the mind and get the bullshit up off me
The Jedi, only use The Force if ya force me
Shaolin What? Don't get it fucked up and cross me
Rappers gettin stuck for actin stuck up and flossy
Say it ain't so! Bust the callico
Rap from the Island called Stat', here we go


Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
It's them kids from the otherside "Shaolin" Worldwide
Method Man, Homocide, nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide, boo, we P.L.O

Fo' sho', if it don't blow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it ain't dough, gotta go

"I've seen 357s
I've seen 12-gauge shotguns
I've seen 12-gauge, um, pumps, eight-shooters
I've seen um, .45, um, military special with clip on the street
I've seen hand grenades
I've seen beer-can bazookas made
Damn things hit you, it's just as getting hit with a gun"



I spit it like eight AKs
Murder verse spray first
Birds circle when they say they names

Announce 'em dead, count the heads
Write raps with an ounce of lead
Hid all the master bread
Making sure the hounds are fed
I'm the pterodactyl striking fear in so many

 I'm the ace of kings, toasts up
 Raise your Henny now


Salute to the finest
You in the company of royalty
Sir I, your highness
I can tell you about stackin' a grip
Out in Paris with the baddest bitch
Sittin' at a fashion event
Went from street life to neon lights
Don P on ice

 Fee's tight
Never free on mics
 Got third-world niggas screaming "Deck's the truth"
 And they co-sign E-S when he steps in to bless the booth
 I-N-S never rest, see true
 Czarface
 For the head we shoot
Wuuuuu


I've seen all this
You'd be surprised man
Pretty soon they're gonna steal the damn atom bomb



(Esoteric) Indiana Jones, fuck these snakes to tame
It's like the NBA, too many fakes in the game
Now why is that Deck?


The cake's to blame
In the end I would play it the same
To be for real that's the day it changed
They hate it from the day I came

(Esoteric)
So lame, Jealous One's Envy then they fold like paper planes
I aim and deliver to their, brain and their liver
And I bang out that literature, ain't no one sicker than I
Or us, we're fly we're wise you ride the bus
We're diamonds in the rough, industry we don't trust
We rally troops, rock mics and get loose


And for ya'll didn't bless the youth

(Esoteric)
That's the truth


Cap...


Cappadonna mind twist flows and mega-charm
Hong Kong style that'll break ya man's arm
I'm good with this mic, that's word is bond
You a sucka MC, I'm gonna have to sound this alarm
Punks lust over my queen and it's hard to get it
Yo you snitched on Don, told the world I did it
Yeah your arms is too short to box with God
Compared to the king you just another retard
My style come in threes like tic-tac-toe
And every time you see me I'm gettin' that dough
And I know a hundred rappers that want to be like me
I hate all y'all niggas so I sent my wifey
It's the angel of rap, yeah straight from heaven
I fly cherry-head niggas like 9-11
If I don't bust you, yeah nigga my man's gonna touch you
What you gonna do with a Don like this?


Islam righteous, the god on his deem
Move d motherfucker d Radio Raheem
Idi Amin, I kill needy for the cream
See I'm pristine, needy for the team
The most powerful piece in chess is the queen
The most powerful peace in death is the dream
I don't want to say that I'm the best but I'm king
I don't want to leave a fucking mess at the scene
Put holes in your body like the flesh of a fiend
Gold Maserati and my neck full of gleam
The first half ill and the rest is obscene
A herb stand still when I'm vexed when I'm mean
My mom's crib stocked with the best gudagine
The four-fifth cocked, it's a Glock with a beam
Upper echelon rhyme, rock to a fiend
Cut your fuckin' spine on the dime, nahmean
Stupid! Hahahahaha

Yo, man, you see shorty right there (look at shorty right there)
Yo, I'mma call you back in a second, aight?


Yo, excuse me Miss Thang with your nose ring
The way your body swing, you make a nigga wanna sing
I can tell by the bling-bling, you like the finer things
And you highly motivated by what money brings
You got a dope fetish, attitude to go get it
A little athletic, no need for cosmetics
A little bowlegged, street smarts and good credit
You got the best part, that's why you actin' hard headed
It's a man's world, baby girl, don't forget it
But what's a thug without his ladybug, I must respect it
I know a woman's worth, ladies come first
I'm the Sun, you're the Earth, mother of the universe
I know what you like, you go for the street type
Who keep the g tight, and hit the G-spot right
I just might, call my wife
Tell her "Baby, I'm not comin' home tonight"


Damn (yo look at shorty right there) nah, look at shorty right there

(Yo look at shorty right there) nah, look at shorty right there
(Look at shorty right there) damn



Yeah, checkin' baby girl with the wavy curls
Precious lady pearl in the shady world
Please to meet you, your dress fit as if see through
Niggas treat you like royalty and dream to freak you
Diva in your own right, keep your home right
Bad bitch with the switch, let's trip the strobe lights
Tight with the Power-U, I'll devour you
Everything about you, make me scout you
No doubt, boo, make me fiend for a taste
Your hot like a fireplace, shows in your face
Now, come out the closet, baby girl, it's safe
Just a taste, of sex, lies and videotape
Let's skate, but late on the way, sound clever
Drinkin' brown leather, she down for whatever
We he call tomorrow, that's the question asked
Call it love at first sight, til the next one pass like




Look at shorty right there, with the six-pack
Lookin' like a fruit snack with the shoe strapped to her knee caps


Look at shorty right there in the blue Range
With the two bangs, high in the eye, she's a true dame


Nah, look at shorty right there, with the mini skirt
With pink finky shirt, the way her body jerk make my jimmy hurt


Nah, shorty right there, the amazon
Six foot three, with the glasses on, built for a marathon


Look at shorty right there with the big hips (where?)
With the group of chicks, aiyo, lady who ya'll rollin' wit?


Shorty right there, with the white dude
In the sky blue, knowin' she fly, friend is right too...
Look at shorty right there!




The Power of God's in you, show n prove
(Yeah, this is The Power)
The power of God's in you, show n prove
(True Power, showin' and provin')
The Power of God's in you, show n prove
True, the time has come through
Chose the few, must show and prove


I once asked God to forgive for my sins
Bent on my knees pleadin' to be Heavenly cleansed
Said the Holy Ghost changed the ways and actions of men
When I stood, I felt the same as if I just walked in
I was twelve at the time, held nines, held mines
A frail mind, criminal thoughts well-designed
Then the Older Gods put me on, on how to rock this
Maintain, 360, Lord and live prosperous
His jewel was priceless, keep the cypher righteous
Bare in mind, God, some of your own won't like this
I'm mentally scarred, recuperatin' from abrasure
Fooled by interpretations made from a traitor
It's in my nature, I was taught, that's the first law
Obtain the food, clothin' and the shelter that I search for
The fire in my eyes is hot as Earth's core
What hurts more, the fact that we still dirt poor
In hard times force crimes out of honest man
And most fiend to see the so-called promised land
Sun of Man, knowledge, wisdom and understand
That it's time to take matters in our own hands


The power of God's in you, show n prove
The power of God's in you, show n prove
The power of God's in you, show n prove
True, the time has come through
Chose the few, must show and prove


The wicked ways of the world can't escape sin
I'm facin' master's  gun on the plantation
Seen source from home yet I'm still caged in
'Cuz 9000 miles is such a long way to swim
And many die tryin' to survive the next mile
Families was raised as slaves and exiled
I learned it as a child, knowledge be the key
To unlock your brain and set your mindstate free
It's true, the times come through, chose the few
Show n prove, the power of God's in you
Or remain a savage in pursuit of happiness
Who lacks jewels, love and peace  - complete the package
The fact is, five out a hundred know the truth
The wisdom might blow the roof when shown and proved




Through the course of time, we was dumb, deaf and blind
Now, we on the incline, build with one mind
Came a long way but, yo, we still far behind
So, uplift the mind, God, rise and shine
I speak to the black, brown and yellow seeds
My fellow breed all races, colors and creeds
Search for the knowledge, use science and math
And be queens and kings like the centuries past
The devil tried to fool my people, said we was equal
But I believe him when my culture sees freedom
You beat 'em with the positive thoughts, you don't need 'em
Leave him in the dirt, let the blood suckers see him






The power of God's in you (show and prove)
The power of God's in you (show and prove)
The power of God's in you (show and prove)
True, The time has come through
Chose the few, must show and prove


Yea, this is the power, true power
Showin and provin

I'm paper chasing, I see the vapors in they faces
King of Hearts playing with aces
You a Joker, Looking like a smoker
Saying you a hustler, Looking like a customer
Don't discuss with us, Conversation on the phone
Slow grind, Kind of patient on our own
Nobody tell if my shit ain't known
So I doubt they ever catch me with the work and the chrome
Try schooling little homie, Don't put dirt in your home
Before you have them alphabet boys searching your home
Graduation from the game, Lacerations on my brain
I can't explain, Think we're going insane
You want change you need a couple dollars
So I think change add up to a couple dollars
So I hustle harder, I but the revolver
Plus I leave your face like a broken carver or punches from Tara


If it ain't about paper then it ain't about nothing
Niggas say they getting bread, Show something, Show something
If it ain't about paper then it ain't about nothing
Niggas say they getting bread, Show something, Show something
(When you see me on the ave. I can see you riding bad
I'm doing good they doing bad, Cause they ain't getting no bread)


Since time is money my money is time
But some niggas ain't built for the grind
Everything the glitters ain't gold
But you know you can't tell a nigga nothing
So I guess he gotta learn on his own
I'm all about getting paper but I watch them haters
If you ain't part of my team then you gets no favor
And beggars can't be choosers and winners cannot be losers
And hating niggas'll try to do ya so I shoot with the shooters
Get em, Get em, We hot, Taylor ran up in the spot
I got his back with a Glock, Yall ain't really wanna pop
This year's a new year, My niggas getting money even on leap year
I'm telling yall niggas yall can't eat here




I say money, Cash, Cream, Dinero
Get it how you get it my figures are six zeros
Strip to strip, I get my work in, Brick for brick
Big timing nigga stick your trick
Sick fruity colored kicks, Movie star chicks
Clique like a dominatrix with chains and whips
Yeah-Yeah, If it's money I'm there
And I ain't worried about a thing
I'm like, Let me find something to wear
I ain't needy but I'm greedy, I was told to take it
This the real me, You don't fake it til you make it
I a hands on nigga, Let me touch something
Steady hood hustling with the semi tucked stunting
Cash rules everything, Don't stop get it get it
Long as you know the repercussions come with it
I'm in it to the limit, Staking for them later days
Living like Usain Bolt on a paper chase






One, two, one, two, the High Chief
Yeah... yo... so alone... baby


I'm just lookin' out of the window
Watchin' the gunshots blow-ow
Thinkin' how we all was turnin' out
Keepin' my head above water
Got to make a weight when I can (cuz I can)
Temporary lay off, cop pay offs, daily rip offs
Informer tip off, clips lick off
The judge got hit off, boss got knocked off
Worker made a come off, cash got dropped off
Buildings got burnt out, sisters got turned out
Work out in the yard up North, tryin' to burst out
Pissy elevators, dirty cop favors
Tongues hiding razors, minors turn majors
Wave the bigger tools, shoot out inside the school yard
The game ain't' changed, niggas done made their own rules
They buildin' plans, they pull a million dollar scam
Watch for taped conversations, Jakes and dollar bands
The black market, labelled the movin' target
Dwellin' in the heartless projects
Evil eyes walkin', the BBS rims flossin'
The beat walk in, harassin' the street walkin'
They keep talkin', like the Rebel might slow up
They set me up to go up, the witness din't show up


Look out in drug stores (but I'm slippin') bare approach the look out
Be off the block by ten, the kite was sent
Then all those who dare to oppose, were sent back
Chained to the train track, protect ya jaw
These silverback niggas eat their oatmeal raw
Cee Allah sawed the shotti, 'Preme went down for a body
He killed Poppy, dusted in the lobby, toxy off shocky
Cops be harassin' tryin' to stop cashin'
The episodes pass, I flash back to guns
And crack stashed in grass, you movin' savage
Please warn him of his ways and actions
Before I blast him
Then the homicide was justified when I arrive
Black tints on the glass with the stockin' cap mask
It's all official, steel pistol style whip you, to the gristle
While my team be stompin' you out after the whistle


I went from the slums of Hell to paradise in Heaven
From a slingshot to a wall of Mac-11's
I drank with the Devil and ate with the Reverend
We talked numbers and I told 'em, that mine was 7
The total amount of hits, behind the collapsed building
That had exploded in a frenzy of killings
Bodies lay near tons of twisted metal
Of a structure and atomic force, it leveled
From the tale of the tape, the product failed in comparison
The weight, the height, the reach, was not a year within
Sight, the significant, difference was the ammo
Wrecking y'all individuals in the nano
Second by second, heat blazed through the night
Leaving a dazzling array of neon lights
The primary reason of mission for them spitting
The firing kept hitting, them ducks that kept sitting
But the informants x-rays gave off electrons
Within a few next days, entire sets gone
Prenticle precisions used to remove the eyelids
Those responsible for my brothers with high bids
Life in the hood is an award winning film
Lived out by savages who can't escape the realm
A place where the young meet and greet with guns
In the park they interrupt the pure innocent fun

When I'm locked down I use Timbs as my shower slippers
I'm in the background mingling with the powder flippers
In the basement, hard-body power lifters
I crush sour in the sifter, see how I lift her
Universal God I stay scientific
The kid with the Golden Arms, Iron Fisted
Stay Asiatic, so cinematic
Noise in the attic, bang out with them automatics
It's hood politics that bring the hunger back
I'm straight chopping wood, call me the lumberjack
Check the catalog put out a hundred packs
Watch for drug sniffing dogs they coming from the back
I'm straight thunder clap the funky drummer's back
It's pure Dopium, give em a heart attack
I stay stacking plaques like ancient artifacts
Joe Namath in the game I'm the quarterback


Eight balls of coke, blunt to the greenery
Pounds in the trunk get you a concrete scenery
Handmade ox'll get you dumped in the mess hall
Snitch niggas run to C.O.s to confess all
This is street knowledge, knowledge I school college
Like a speech from the GZA, sharp like the RZA
Don't run with a scissor, nigga the truth is the
Truth, now I'mma drop a few jewels in the booth
Used to boot crack, stuff em inside a tennis ball
Ans throw it when they rushing the block, trust no cops
Driving around with two mitts in my socks
Cooked coke gon' get you in more trouble than money
Don't crawl through dust juice the pigs is hungry
You think they ain't watching
They watching while you uptown copping
Back home while you're cooking and chopping
They scheming on the block waiting to get it popping


He had a sword and an axe with cuts
Under a road that was woven from silver and gold, waxed it up
His army was so great in quantity
His crops and livestock boost the economy
Many would travel by boat to see him
His image adorned most schools and coliseums
A merchant, hustle those silk and velvets
Portrait illuminated when the torch was well-lit
Picture so beautifully painted that
One thought it would breathe or move cause it would leave a mood
Or energy, you see his wife practiced Yoga
Made herbal enhancers that had saved the soldiers
Guard the treasures in the chambers, halls and vaults
Well-prepared for all assaults
Heavy guarded village
Armed with the sharpest weapons designed to pierce and cause blood spillage


From a young teen, a murder team, inspired by crime
See Allah Just granted permission for my position
Sit down, write rhymes, escaping this repetitive cycle
Slinging dimes, losing time, doing hard time
Teaching y'all mathematically, come see
The epitomy of what you wanna be - emcee
My semi-auto gun mandatory at the sound clash
The mic touched, dance mashed up, pounds of the best
Green glass bottles of don, I sip the liquor slow
Flow so devastating when I go solo
Even when I'm dolo, pretty gun I'm holding
Head swollen off the solid gold soul
Iron Mic pole beat your face like you stole something, trust me
Living life royalty, all wise and healthy
Welcome to the best of me, from knowledge to infinity
Never stopping my projectory, I'm galactic


Yo, peace to all of the gods and all of the earths
We been building like this ever since the first day of birth
The more I start to build, the better I feel
Keep ignorant niggas from me, use dummies for shield
You're not Godbody son, you're just garbage and real snotty
Cherry head gaylord still stuck in the lobby
This the first Now Born, son I'm blessed with mad lessons
Conquered crazy devils, my mind is a weapon
You can't fast with me and avoid the swine
You degenerate emcee, I'm the best of mankind
Allahu Akbar straight jewels and real stars
I'm down with the RZA, got help for the Widow's Son
Pop off on you, you ain't nothing to me - DUN DUN
Original Tyzeem, Holy water, Visine
Designated wordplay, God respect my deen
Shine on little stars and respect the Queen


New York Giant, call me Deck Umenyiora
Fresh with the water connect, two and a quarter
Deal with the dealer, don't trust the transporter
My job is done once I get it to the border
Perico, coke game is kilos of cocaine
Hypodermic needle to the groove, I dose veins
Overdoser, you know the product is raw right
Lines take you there like I wrote it with off-white
Got him bent up, hands looking like a tin cup
Sorry no consignment, get your ends up
Move from the gate now, he on his way straight to Jake now
I'm on the hush with my weight loud
Got the shakes now, how they want it bad
Five or six heads chipping in for a bag
I got the works like a burger deluxe
Get your fix while I'm serving it up, word to us






I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
At second hands, moms bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, rocking the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I be getting the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son, rolling with this one and that one
Pulling out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smoking woolas at 16
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-tight clique and went all out
Catching keys from across seas
Rolling in MPV's every week we made forty G's
Yo brothers respect mine or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-POW, move from the gate now


I'm so tired, sheep are counting me
No more struggle, no more energy


It's been twenty-two long hard years of still struggling
Survival got me bugging, but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck selling drugs and such who never had much
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not touch
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacing - going upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned I learned life is hell
Living in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes giving chase, selling base
Smoking bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed and I ask what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained working hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks and
Stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be living proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's running wild, smoking sess, drinking beer
And ain't trying to hear what I'm kicking in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic


I'm so tired, sheep are counting me
No more struggle, no more energy
No more patient, you can write that down
It's all to crazy, I'm not sticking around




See sometimes you have to flash back, Retrospect
And see yourself, Sometimes


Can I please get a moment to build
For all of my niggas that died in The Hill
To the babies bein born, All they futures fulfilled
For the ones die'n to live it and reppin it still
Can I get another moment for Momma
For holdin back tears that makes all the drama
How you prayed that I wouldn't waste my life on the corner
Never saw me as a burden growin up with no father
Everybody got dreams of the millions
I dream we stop sceamin of killin and start teachin our children
Let em know that they the most high, Reach for the ceiling
You don't have to be no Scarface bleeding for buildings
So I take this moment out for Sinyah
Surprised it took a birth of a child to open my eyes up
I made my own decision to wise up
So act like you notice, Stay focused let's rise up


Let's rise up, See if it be like this
I ain't even gonna rhyme no more
It's food for thought man, Get you a plate
A knife and a fork and eat this up
This that shit right here, Enough said



Shoot em On Sight Sight Sight (3x)
Shoot em On Sight Sight Sight 



Another mission, Street Life, gun talk, Sir I

Don't push me, because I'm close to the edge
Livin on this thin line, I know the ledge
Allegience I pledge strictly to my comittee
Way above the law, we soar the inner city
My crime pays, deep in the metro, nines blaze
Shorties watchin plus adoptin my ways
In the PJ's, the heat blaze and beats raid
Can't see the cage but can't leave the Streets Of Rage


It's a Shoot On Sight fair, warfare prepared, arm yourself beware hardware tear through your flesh and bones bear
Witness stand clear
Flash the Wu-sign to see if my comrades is in here
P.L.O. began this, 99 bananas
Wu extravaganza, cops scandals and guns, a S.O.S
Prepare for the slug fest, unusual suspect disconnect your outfit
It's a dead-end Street, I play for keeps release
Shots through your fleece, retreat, delete you from the crime spree

Chorus
Shoot em On Sight Sight Sight (2x)  

When you got beef wit one time-S.O.S
When you standin on the front line-S.O.S
Niggas wanna steal your sunshine-S.O.S

When it comes time to do or die-S.O.S
For the five-oh that brutalize-S.O.S
Before you try suicide-S.O.S


Street chronicle, wise words by the abominable
High honourable, rap quotable phenomenal
Seniority kid, I speak for the minority
Ghetto poverty fuck the housing authority
Not to be idolized, I deal wit grand larceny
Money laundering, auto theft, and armed robbery
99 regiment torment your resident
Street intelligence child, Killa Hill pedestrian
Sucker for love-ass, niggas catch a gay-bash
Slim-Fast from the gun blast burner, I last
The S-T-R, double E-T, own a Desert E
Keep it closely, I feed off envy and foul energy
Your best friend's your worst enemy
Thug therapy until they bury me, it's do or die tonight
Shoot out a street light, bleak life
Aim at your windpipe, squeeze tight


In the parking lot, parked in a dark spot
The specialist wit one shot been at the drop
Your Highness INS, darts catch your body
Feds got me on watch with nothing yet to charge me
I strike quick, movin on the night shift
Rollin wit those who been the same likeness
Where I come from the blast make your ears go numb
Trust no one 'cause murderers range old to young
And death don't discriminate, to choose your fate
Shot wit hypodermic sword wit the trey-eight
Gotta hold your weight, there's no escape from the mayhem
I'm living for now but tryna make it to the a.m
Creeping in the hallways, we always on barrow
Calico crept close to over cash flow
The neighbourhood watch, the skunks in my sock got me rocked
But keep my eyes on the shot clock

Chorus



*kung fu fighting*


It's the sound of the slums, drama with drums
You pop shots with the corks, cause a problem for some
Got the whole city up, floatin' with the semi tuck
Roamin' out of zone, and I'm known in the gritty cuts
And a Wu Killa Bee co-d, dumpin' off
Broad day, no macks, so you know it's me
Notice me, I shine like July sun
Live son, I'm a rider through provide one
Show the CREAM, I bust and blow the scene
In a fast car, kickin' up dust and smoke screen
Hit a nigga hard as Joe Green, his whole team
Feel it, swollen veins, a dope fiend feeling
Coming out the mouth, like you won't be killing
Yeah, you sold three million but you banned on the block
Long guns to your face, pass the mansion and yacht
And you ain't retaliatin' man, you ran to the cops


Uh, all gangstas and fellow MC's, we now meet
The threat is now an actual fact, and that's the least
The lion paw, ripping your jaw, dismantle face piece
You may not have heard of seen, my Murder One Team
Something's best untold, crime related
I am who I am, so fuck it, if son stuck it
We all lay to play to the best, sip the fine grace
My rugged lifestyle is survived, I don't apoligize
Hustle is the road I chose, there's no compremising
When the guns is drawn, shots fire
Son, all my killas is fam, nothing hired
Ya'll faggot niggas wired for sound, before the things blast
Wait for the train to past, man, face down
We straight from the murder capital town, it goes down
Daily on the regular, dressed in assassin attire
The bulletproof rap, strap 'em with the bomb to his body
Ain't no coming back...




Yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah...
Let's go...
Yeah, listen...


The sound of the horns says it's on
We storm through like C. Thomas, Red Dawn
Step like a don through the city, Deck bonds
I get my hands dirty, Nikes scuffed, sweat pouring
Still I stay fresh with the fly white linen
Duece times 5, that's my type women
Sonny, I live it, O-10, S5 tinted
Brother Deck, what I rep, S.I., dig it?
Fifty cal' flow, get low
Intro to outro, bout it tho, whoa
Steady, heavy like a '52 Chevy
Niggas ain't ready, I turn out your lights like Teddy
Roll like dice in the casino
Known to spit lava, Heat like DeNiro and Pacino
Manifesto, Wu-Tang Gambino
Lay it down, then I fly off like the hero

"Wu-Tang!"
"Wu-Tang!"


The Wild Cowboy number one
G-O-D, how you gonna block out the son?
Read my jacket, my achievements stretch like a warning track catch
The in-crazable voice box, I throw you boys rocks
Diamonds and jewels, a holiday, pros that fuck in schools
I'm a tank, I stop panzers, take down stanzas
Sixteen bars, keep the car running
Broads stunting, feed ya self, kill ya self, take the pill
Punks jump up to get beat down
New York the sweet town I sorta, who's on tour?
Who the vile, truth can say, you ain't a slouch
Now Rule local, now I'm B.K. vocal
Right out the X, you can work out your pecs and your back
Can beat the death with bats, need to tune up, NJ'll turn the tune up
I'mma tell you who's soon enough to got
And I ain't down with getting crossed, and I never been the boss

"Wu-Tang!"


Yo, you're hog-tied, I'm roping them, bitches, I'm gropping them
Open up your veins, cop three bags of Dopium
Super soak these niggas, stroke with the magnum force
Leak it in the streets quick, peep my secret sauce
I keep it gloss, I'm suited up for my franchise
Your coins is tossed, man-handle bad guys
Scramble for my damn prize, crack cans of cold Guinness
I'm like Seabiscuit, I'mma win by a photo finish
Nigga, this ain't tennis, yeah, I ain't bluffing shit
I be the street menace on my David Ruffin shit
Police ain't cuffing shit, claiming I'm a crook
Throw up my middle finger, I'm a hall of famer in my book
Right hook, death jooks, great with my footwork
Bubble through, got the W on my hood shirt
Sneak through the wood works like poisonous high fumes
I'm that superhero with the brand new costume

"Wu-Tang!"
"Wu-Tang!"
"Wu-Tang!"
"Wu-Tang!"




Designer and most of man
Stands the front-end loader
Hold enough weight that'll compensate the share-holders
Powerful motor controls are mad stable
No room for error, injury proves fatal
Hundred ton air-jack, quickly raise the steel
After blowin' out the belt drive, Math' change the wheels
Bust ya, slash ya, we still thick like plaster
There's always potential for large scale disasters
In the rec' rippin' narrowly missin'
My camp be forced into periless proposition
We must come see ya, despite imminent danger
Was short on fuel, before he flew out the hangar
From the cold dirt, rocks and all, rap galore
Watch the river flow backwards once we storm the shore
Nigga, mark with razor-sharp eyes of the scope
On the ropes, hanging from the towel and cliffs and slopes
The magnitude of the devastation untold
The collective laws of countless souls lay in the road


Insane flower, vein blower
Aim and it's game over
You know the name, flame-thrower
Got the code to the game and I hold the main controller
Soldiers from the jump, and today the same soldier
I stay low, play close to bank rolls
Polly with the greatest who walk the same road
Oh you ain't hear? Ain't nuttin' new but the gear
The crew of the year, kid too much to bear
Find out what I'm about, know the legend
The slight disrespect of his name provoke tension
No threat, bringin' the force like Boba Fett
The old vet whose presence alone control the set
I'm next level, ya best settle, bless Rebel
I shine like a bezel, with strength to bend metal
"Plunge head first in the grunge, become emerged the drums
The verse is murder one


We rhyme back-to-back, deangerous emcees
Move on track-to-track 100 bar measure
Lost treasure, those crews who never gave us much pleasure
Agreed the sound was good, shoppin' in the state, city, town and hood
Eventually they would
Lay down the trademark with god that built wealth
To dip-dive in the beehive was on self
For the power struggle, never clown but did juggle
The heavy load made it explode to mad rubble
I thought of this tune on a blackout guided by the light of the moon
On a camp-out, the kerosene lamp out
So we walked the road we paved
With trails that left vinyl footsteps engraved



 Uhh
 Deadly melody part two
 That's my word!
It ain't safe no more... bitch!


Yo, yo
Brain gets punctured and drained through the nasal
Hour of assassination be upon you
Movin with the tiger strike, bound, gagged and shot
Red the head in, dapple light centered
East remains hot with police
But I keep a lease for my, four-fifth automatic
Extended clip rewind, bust mine
Anytime you reveal your snakeish ways and actions
Observe the magnetic attraction


And it's time for some grid...


...iron rap, action-packed grudge match
Tough act to follow, hard copy novel
Throw you off the Verrazano
We swimmin with these sharks, yo I rate bodyguard
Stamp my initial in your birthmark
P.L.O., bust like a calico, tally ho
Black expo, Tecs in afros, we back yo
It's Dolemite, crash your windpipe, with the mic device
Fatal strike, daily mic fights, shoot out the street lights


Sight beyond sight, late night, city light
Tight like a virgin, mergin with my A-Alikes
Splurgin, dirty to the grain, no detergent
Filthy, innocent until I'm proven guilty
Submergin, deeper in the lecture I'm servin
Truth or consequences, life or death sentence
I'm hurtin, your person, I'm certain, it's curtains

Chorus: Method Man

It ain't nuttin like hip-hop music
You like it cause you choose it
Most DJ's won't refuse it
A lot of sucker MC's misuse it
Don't think that Wu can't lose it
Too much to gain to abuse it
The name of the game is rapture
This one is complete, it captures bass


Yo, I bring chaos to blocks like the riots in Watts
Rapid fire shots ripple through Kevlar, 9 Glocks
Technique of rhyme pop machine gun ammo
Sporadic flow buckled a foe, intro to outro
Calico, throw verse, but slide my dough first
I make thousands in the club with no shirts, go bezerk
From the Shao' borough, whylin out on the furlow
Commando, styles thorough, solo inferno
It burns slow, thermonuclear degrees
Heads are underseas down to the youngest seeds
Wannabes clone, they light like summer breeze
Hundred G's for the Garden, them fans stampede
For the top cats, hit the mic like the iron-palm blast
Equipped to perform the task
S-I-N-Y, and what, head or gut
The head rush, will cause your cerebellum to bust


We be the world's most fabulous
Hazardous, to fuck with these ravenous
Killers get you stuck to the wall like wooden cabinets
Extravagant, je-wel drop a helicopter high
Up into the sky, lines philosiphize, I got stocks to buy
Watch my pockets rise, to the bottom bust confide in God
In Sin I trust, the villianous, criminal minded killers rust
I intend to build and fortify in men
Mastermind rhymin, navigate the globe then retire quick


Aiyyo fluid rap bend through it black, buluga black Ac'
Tackle that, ghetto tabernackles throw it in your lap
Slang A-K, national, geographical
Mathematical, slide up in your work casual
Nike Air Dog, who wear it all, plus down to brawl
All a thousand with a bloody hair, flammable
Rap mayors, who clap Himalayas pinky fingers
Ever glacer, lacer, hand laser touches grail bomb blazers
Sly-workin, network bezerk, mad hurtin
Killer whales, fucking up sales, crash Bloomingdales
Masqevendo, John Lennon tenor break, mad descendo
Fuck y'all niggas carve my ice through your Benz window

*door creaking open*
*gunshots followed by a car alarm*

Chorus


Uhh.. Spazz-Ola.. (Spazz-Ola)
S-I-N-Y 10304
Lock your doors
Crack your jaws
Drop your drawers
It's all day everyday with this rap souflee



F/ Inspectah Deck


Yo.. Ins the Rebel, your highness
With 7L and Esoteric, speaking real words
Speak on it kid!


Yo, I touch the mic like a savage
The Esoteradactyl's rap style's beyond average
To say the least, I'm slayin beasts with the right plan
I'll take your hype man and beat him with the mic stand
You're like, "Damn!I better get a resource"
I'll overpower three-fourths of your police force
You're talkin to a fugitive who'll serve your crew
Fake his own death and come back to murder you
Who raps to the crack of dawn? Who's the droid
Who destroyed numerous humanoids like atom bombs?
You're nothin but a tag-a-long, that I be raggin on
7L's on the cut, while Joe is tappin on
The 3000, me I'm just loungin
Waitin for a sucker mc to start poundin
You know the deal, so check the cassette
It's Esoteric and Inspectah Deck, what you expect?

{7L cuts and scratches


Yo, yo, yo
I stash heat, creep past police on the beat
Keep it movin in the mean streets, I the black sheep
Roll deep with the Killa Beez, quick on the squeeze
Freeze - nobody move, just hand over the G's
Gone with the breeze, everything's peace at ease
Now I'm laid back, countin stacks, twistin the trees
My rap's scorchin - way beyond third degrees
Enemies get blown like autumn leaves
Authorities comb the block, I'm peepin they steez
After me cause the rhyme's worth about two ki's
And double that 'cross seas
Fiends buy off the heez, the result's more currencies
Them no worry we, I strike em down suddenly
Funny how they rush me, must be the money
You hate me or you love me, don't ever (fuck) me
Trust me, we can make the scene turn ugly

{7L cuts and scratches


I'm like a man posessed that can't confess
Yes it's the Es' to bless, wicked test pressed to rest
Crab rapper, my raps shatter your wax platter
Esoteric's data can stab up the tracks badder
My words flow for the, rap cats who rep locally
Transmit poetry fit to hit em globally
Eso', yes status fresh from the get go
Sinister, ready to administer the death blow
On rap cats cause I'm takin it back
To a time when it was cool to call hip-hop rap
Cause I've been rappin, since fly sneakers were cheap
Since I bought em off Koreans down on Washington Street
Since I had a cameo, since I rocked rope chains
Since I had gold fronts with the Polo frames
Since "Goin' Way Back," since pro black rap
Since the Jungle Brothers let me know "I Got it Like That"

{7L cuts and scratches to the end

Well, You could be here one day, Gone in a minute
Cause life is so short but as long as I'm in it
See I'm, I'm just living at the speed of light
I'm just living at the speed of light
And I will never waste a minute
I'm never giving up and I'm breaking every limit
Cause I'm, I'm just living at the speed of light
I'm just living at the speed of light


Ayo I'm living at the speed of light, Gaining momentum
A hundred thou on my next, Fifty grand in my denims
Exotic women all around me
These fake ballers throwing dubs up in the club
Making it rain, Couldn't drown me
I got mint money, Two years from 50 Cent money
First degree murder, Yall niggas just out of tip money
I been hungry, I been starve'n, I had ninety-nine problems
Solved eighty-nine, Now I got ten problems
So I'ma leave it up to yall, I resolved half of the ten
The other five I'ma leave up to God
Cause I read all the comments that you leave on the blogs
You critics can eat a dick cause I'm constantly on my job




Now everybody's thinking something's wrong with Diesel
Since my Pop's passed I don't get along with people
I speak to God in a cathedral, Praying for forgiveness
Cause I'm living at the speed of light, Breaking every limit
Big business, Whip tinted, I'm blowing on piff spinach
I'm all like Doug E. Fresh so just give me my six minutes
And wit it, I'ma take it to the maximum
Show'n love to all of my fans cause I will never turn my back on them
Haters I laugh at em, Throw'n my cash at em
Fuck a middle finger I'm show'n my ass at em
And they can stick it where the Sun don't shine
So God forbid if I don't make it then my son gone shine




Yo-Yo, Ayo, The world is mine I saw the writing on the blimps
Since life's a bitch I just gotta treat her like a pimp
I ain't never been a dreamer, Never been asleep
Momma pray'n that her boy ain't deep up in these streets
See no one gave him nothing, What's mine I had to take it
Me against the World, Close friends showing hatred
Jealousy is juvenile, It's gonna take more
Die for what I live and I ain't scared to face war
I'm a winner, Working like Noah on his ark
Throw the fire, I gotta little colder in the heart
Man I told you from the start, This is my World
Paint my life story on a fly mural through the five Burroughs





 + (Tash Mahogany)
She's my number one gangsta chick (my starter) She's my number one starter chick
She's my number one drafted pick, she's my number one line on the hit
I only wanna see it (my starter) It's truly needed, When the ball drops...
Anything she say, you know I'm gonna do (my starter)
Watch out, watch out, when that ball drops...


You'se a starter, like Candace Parker
Take flight like Skywalker, might wolf it on ya father
Student Athlete, player of the week
G.P.A. 4.0 and her game's complete
Skintone buttercream, all defensive team
Dreamgirl like Jennifer Hudson, you're my Queen
To be, I'm ya King, keep ya under the wing
Together we can capture the ring
You the human highlight, body type, just right
Hairdo stay tight, go hard ball all night
All-star shine so bright
Hall of famer, about to take the game to new heights
You're my number one draft pick, McDonald classic
No look dunks to the basket
Yeah, yeah, that's mine, that's mine...




Blunt smoke, fifth hundred stroke
I'm going nuts, full clip, shoot up her fat lips
And round butt, catch Heat when I'm In Too Deep
The answer beeps, she take dives on the busiest streets
Whatever situation or the circumstances
Outdoor, indoor, she's taking the chances
Hotel, motel or Holiday Inn
Overlooking that bible, she continued to sin
Spread wide on the desk, paperwork all in a mess
While the ceiling fan blowing her dress
Ten minutes of jerking along with the slurping
Her skirt hid her talent until I raised the curtains
Showtime at the Apollo, she'll follow my lead
Then get on her knees, then swallow her pride
Strapped and ready to ride




Yeah, that's my down bitch
That's my down bitch, anything she do for her man
If it's lying on the stand, fish frying in the pan
She a Queen like Liz the third, wicked curves
On her word, stay still, rocking linens and furs
While she do it in the sack, jazz music in the back
Flat blew a nigga back, act two, I'm into that
Damn right, she the star of my team
When we stepped on the strip, baby girl, we the heart of the scene
Whether Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan or Queens
Staten Island, she styling, if not, she's not seen
Playboy status, every man's lust
She acting all shy, but she likes handcuffs


I'm the first on the court, first to hit the dance floor
The floss in this rap sport, what more can ya ask for?
Let ya glass pour, Wu-Tang is here now
All my Independent Women, time to let ya hair down
Bottles popping, everything is fair ground
Fresh legs, window shopping, can't help to stare it down
You'se a starter cuz I chose ya first
Baby, you'se a starter, where you throw that skirt
Lady, you'se a starter, where ya hold it down
Yeah, I'm Cold Blooded, then ya love my style
This is rush hour traffic, first one to merk off
It's like clockwork, first to get ya work off
I'm the workhorse, Killa Bee performer
Pro darter, starter, not a bench warmer, what?




You've learned how to kill
Every moved you've learned is trained to that end
Yet, we wish to preserve life
The first thing to learn, is that difference
Then you can start training with us, from the beginning




Oh yeah, motherfucker
It's real
Y'all niggas hold your guns
Throw your guns down, put 'em down

Yo, we in the fields with heat
You fake niggas eat kid meals to me
We street referees, we rock
Jean jackets, thick shirts over turtlenecks
Certified doctors in hoods that still oil techs
But wait, roll cameras, Babyface money blowin like Beech Nut
Call off the mutts, it's me again
Ghost, your host this evenin
(Ladies and gents I'd like to thank you all for comin out tonight)
Tux tight, all sharp, light up a bark, let's mingle
Fetch me a Remy Martin on Diamonds
Flare-leg Gucci joints, I never wore
I might give 'em to my brother-in-law
Fitzpatrick, rich bastard, worth more than Egyptian marrows
Borrow the God jewels, Gucci goggles
That's how the God do, Motown twenty-five
My orals like Smokey's voice, little moist, but choice
We guzzle Dom's, smoke with scratchy throats
Live on the edge, bracelets, shades and classy coats
Jumbo in the club, we play Columbo
Frosty the Snowman, frozen as the milky way
Ice on the floor, El-Producto in the sleeve
In the seam of his mink, he said he don't drink
Think before he talked, he walked like he ordered
Champ room down in Vegas, vendin machines
I sip Alize' compliments of E&J


The streets is rough out here
Crack game came and had us years
What is a man to do? (Brother)
(Stay true, stay true)




Ooh-wee... mmmmmmmm, yeah...


See I was raised out on these mean streets
I'm from the projects, right, where poverty and hell meet
I'm searching everyday to find a better way, I've got a
Hustle still to get my pay before I hit bottom
Now some might say that I'm already there
But who are they to judge or question what I do, son
So I don't care
Tired of eating cheese sandwiches with no meat
Tired of watching all the players from the same seat
So it's a life of crime, some might sing or rhyme
To escape the ghetto before the flatline
Choices to make, what am I gonna do?
Got to use my talents, they gonna pull me through


Now with success, I become a target
They wanna set me up
I guess more money equals more problems
They wanna get me, wanna hit me, strip me of my riches
They wanna cut me up in pieces, leave me deep in ditches


And I can't take it.... but I'm gonna make it...
Yeah... oh... I'm gonna make it... yeah... ohhhhhh
Fight to stay alive


I was raised out on these mean streets
You know where poverty and hell meet
Brothers get jail and life's for sale, cheap
Since momma held me, in her arms, to tell me
That it's a cold world, I done held heat
And held myself down, lot of bodies and shells found
And niggas into taking everything, that ain't nailed down
We fell down, ain't hard to tell now
I ain't trying to see the cell now
Or see momma put her house up for bail now
So I'mma give all I got, to try and get that gwop
Nigga I'm hot with this hustle, go 'head and get the cops
I use my talent to get more figures
Unlike these little corner store niggas
Go change your drawers, niggas


Now with success and I've become a target
They wanna set me up, take me hostage
Or take me down some notches
They wanna hit me, wanna stick me, get me for my riches
They wanna diss me, want a clip me, leave me stiff in ditches

[Hook: Gerald Alston (Method Man)
And I can't take it, no, no, but I'm gonna make it...
(This ain't no game, my life ain't nothing to play with)
Yeah... I'm gonna make it... oooh...
(Face it, money is power and I'mma make it)
I'm gonna make it... oooh...


Yeah, I'm gon' survive, yo, yo, a-yo
N.Y. City, gritty blocks, little love, plenty cops
Few rise, many drop, True Lies, semis cocked
Fishscale, already rocked, heavy shots, that we drop
New guys on every block, blue eyes and red dots
Pregnant mothers, broke fathers, more money, more problems
So hungry, won't starve 'em, work hard and so pardon
I got mouths to feed, I got pounds of weed
I need some more, another store, another house, indeed
An X amount of G, the reason pounds'll squeeze
And strip you naked, basic, trying to make it out the P's
Don't ever doubt a G, and have me spazz like
'Face with the K, and my nose all powdery
It ain't about the streets, it's 'bout the beast within
That won't give in to 'lice, down to bleed, G


Now with success and I've become a target
They wanna set me up, take me hostage
Or take me down some notches
They wanna hit me, wanna stick me, get me for my riches
They wanna diss me, wanna clip me leave me stiff in ditches

[Hook: Gerald Alston (RZA)
And I can't take it (yeah), no, no, but I'm gonna make it...
(Yeah, yea, turn the beat up a little right here)
Yeah... I'm gonna make it... oooh...
(Yo, yo, yo, yeah, yo, just, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)


A-yo, RZA, Meth, GZA, Deck
Ghost and Chef be cashing checks
Killa, Cap be snapping necks
Street and 'Zilla flash the tech
Sacrifice a savage life
If he trying to bag my ice
Tag a price on merchandise
Tell me, is it worth ya life?


No... it's a cold, cold, cold world
You can't be playing games with my life
I've gotta fight to survive, fight to stay alive


A-yo, metal pipes ignite, sparking fire, light the darkness night
Trying to stick me for my riches, now y'all bitches taking flight
Major business, raise the digits, tried to strike me for my life
Slice and dice, men or mice, GZA tell 'em what it's like


A-yo, money making, people flaking, Cash Rules, fuck the bacon
Earth's quaking, head is aching, bank stop, dice shaking
Times are hard, so are jobs, scheming niggas wanna rob
Use a hoe to slob ya knob, hit you with unruly mobs
Stab you in the back and smile, watch you bleed for a while
Hating on the agile, steal ya name and bite ya style
Hold you for a ransom note, Goliath cutting David's throat
Grab ya vest, abandon boat and leave you out at sea to float


Now with success and I've become a target
They wanna set me up, I guess more money equals more problems
They wanna hit me, wanna stick me, get me for my riches
They wanna diss me, want clip me, leave me stiff in ditches


And I can't take it.... no, no... but I'm gonna make it...
Yeah... oh... I'm gonna make it... ooh... yeah...
It's a cold, cold, cold world
I got my hand on my gun, they got a brother on the run
Yeah... it's a cold, cold, cold world
You can't be playing games with my life
I've gotta fight to survive, fight to stay alive
This ain't a game, this is my life
Keep pushing me to the edge, I'm gonna push back
And you won't like that, it's guaranteed you won't like that
When ya laid down, laid flat...




"Who I sleep with is my own personal business"
"Nah, man, no, who you sleep with
The first face you see in the mornin'
Is very, significant, man, that's where you get your energy from
It's your mirror, can you dig it?"


I'm thinking of the drop?
Peace beautiful how you doing?
You know I always see you, girl I wanna know
You know what I had in my mind for you
I just wanted to let you know that, damn girl
(To all the queens), just give me a chance
(To all the earths), I know you dig me, and I dig you (the goddesses)
And I don't see why we can't make this happen
(All the wisdoms) All you gotta do is have the will in yo mind
And the will in mine -- I already got the will in my mind
To say let's make it happen -- (all the syrens)
Let's just see it, man, let's just find out
Because I see the way you look at me, and I look at you
The thing's that on my mind are all the time
It's heaven, girl -- it's just heaven (yo, yo)


Love or lust, voluptious strain struck my eye
Black butterfly, said she'd never love another guy
I was a secret lover, now she says the'll be no other
Hard to keep each other, knowing one day will be discovered
See, I love ya, since my childhood, ma, look how you've grown
We used to zone off and making love through the phone
Now, stay with me, daisy lady drive me crazy
Crazy tried to kill my baby, steal my baby, baby


Girl, I wanna know, you know what
Fact, listen girl (I wanna know)
Just like everybody wanna come at you
I'm comin' at you, but I'm the real man
That wanna let you know something
I wanna let you know, you got it, girl
You know what I mean? You got it, you got the flavor
Like raspberry to strawberries, girl
You the one I need


High priced ice on my neck, cause the windchill
She melt like a snowflake up against my car windshield
Eyes like a reindeer, lost, innocent Bambi
Toss the jammy from me, loved the life family
Long talks and pillow fights, walking at night
All she needed was a little light, shorty shining bright
E-mails flirtin' with you, Bobby bout to burst a missile
Wanted to hurt or tickle, girl, could you slurp it, would you?


Can you hear me? Can you hear what I'm sayin' to you girl?
I'm tryna show you how much I feel, the way I feel for you
But here we go again, ma, one more time
All you gotta do is just take a listen
Just listen to me baby, ok? Just listen
Listen to my needs, listen to your needs


Five and a half in Boys, ass is off the hook
High school pussy, heard you got the best noogie
Sugar walls, watch your love, slide right on my dick
I'm palmin' ya ass like this while you ridin' it
I'm about to cum boo-boo, chill for a sec
I feel it at the tip, ma', your pussy too wet
One false move and I will blast like the very first time
Burnt you with candle wax/wax, while you was slobbin' mine
Dick is sensitive, you move, baby here it is
Oh Lord, I told you not to move, you dumb broad
Cummin' for days, wettin' ya caves
My dick is like the sprinklers and maybe ya dush, I'm here to save the day
Solomon was wise and I got fifty other bitches
Some eat bitches, some bitches fuck my niggas
Solomon was wise and I got fifty other bitches
Some eat bitches, some bitches fuck my niggas


Girl I wanna know..
You know you always stayin' on my mind
Listen to our niggas, ok girl
Girl I wanna know..
Because together we can make a change
That'll be like, ahhh
You feel me girl, do you feel me?
Girl I wanna know..
You always on my mind, girl, always
I wanna know, you know you always stayin' on mind
Can you tell me what I need to know girl?






Looking on various street corners
I'm sure you've seen it yourself
Standing on the corner, is an alleged brother
Dressed in blue, or green, red and black
And starting the news, that the revolution is coming
And you better get ready, sort of like (I feel you son)
The end of the world is coming, unfortunately (I got you, though)
The world is just gonna drag on and on (I know how it is)
And we have a poem that we've written particularly (I said I know how it is)
For the brothers on the street corners


When the revolution come, you can see me on the front line
Firing my gun, standing right beside my son
If I go, it's understood that I stood for something
When my whole life, they told me, I was good for nothing
I was raised by the stray dogs, blazed off, layed off
Breaking laws, graveyard shifting every day war
Focus now, notice how, things change, soldier
I remain the same, I'm older now, I embrace the pain
I blame the struggle, nearly drove me insane
Thought I lost my head, till my brethren told me the same
No tears for the reaper, I've buried bout a thousand
In graffiti, "rest in peace" sprayed off throughout the housing
I tried to stay civilized, the hood's a prison inside
The only difference is the doors don't slide
Still we trapped in the animal cage, cause we got animal ways
So we react, with the animal rage
And my section's real, weapons peel, cheddar's the deal
Seen the depths of hell, now I stare, death in the grill
From the slave ships, to today's bricks, same shit
I'm awake, to the wickedness, and one, with the pavement


The all great mind stays divine, my hands remain deadly
We shine without the hung jewelry, produce light
That'll travel through mics, now as the time riping
We took words that we nourishing, encouraging
A nation to awaken, those who were sleeping
Can you conceive the thought? Transatlantic import
Slave and bought, secret relations between blacks and Jews
Might set a fuse off in the head
Many dead lynch hung, swung from trees
Brothers in the struggle together, eat from one pot
Hold each other down to the sneaker
Nothing come between us
Fast money and chicks, did it to the best of cliques
It's sickening... huh

 (x2)
It's me and you son, forever in the struggle
No doubt, we hustle, survival is the motto
Will you soon follow, a better tomorrow
...For a better tomorrow


I catch a few flashbacks about, going through the struggle
How we used to make dollars, from all the snow we shoveled
In a broke neighborhood, where the kids often dream
About a lavish life, that is mostly seen in the screen
Where some dreams are quickly cut short, due to gang violence
From loud guns, that kept witnesses, in deep silence
Was it bad timing? Jealousy from too much shining?
Or a set up, from a girl that he wined, kept dining
It's a known fact, they will attack, cause it's like that
And depending on the, kind of impact, that strike back
In a town where the talk is cheap and, beef is brief
A mother sobs uncontrollably, and exhibit the grief
Large holes in the front door, of a housing tenement
Allows room to retaliate, so conflict is imminent
This hate in the brain, destroys the cells like cancer
Even experts are stuck with more questions than answers



Yeah, yeah, yeah, Rebel I.N.S., your highness
AKA Ayatollah, the high roller, title holder
For my nigga J-Love, Brace yourself..


1, 2, yo, yo, I swing swords, one into four like Charlie Ward
Clep shooter, crash the SSL Boards
Should of scored when it come crunch time
One time tryin' to steal my sunshine
No time to unwind
I put my hand on my hip, don't let the black chrome slip
Loose lips cause full clips to fly on the strip
So I walk swift, toatin' a Johnny Walker fifth
Niggas talk shit, real heads be spazzin' often
From the Shao borough, that be the sec I claim
Test my grain, find the cause of death hard to explain
With the pen still smokin, I drop the next lame
He got the same hot flame before the cops came
I be makin' heads spin, like Dayton
While takin you back to phat tags and breakin'
This is Menage-a-trois for your mental, diggin' out the instrumental
I drive you wild like a rental

 (x2)
The Tiger and Crane techniques. The tigers fast, tough, fierce, hard
A sick one - your swordplay, inspector, has much improved


Yo, hittin' there like Thomas Hearns
Bustin' wild, the weed burn
Shorty sixteen, yearns for my whole crew to take turns
I'm a loose cannon, medically examine
Found deadly as a plague, so it spread like famine
Splurgin', whippin' out the dirty version
Throwin' rocks at the ghetto birds circlin' the urban
Workin' overtime, you know it's just shine
Niggas scope mine, might as well work for for po-nine
But who's sign, light up the city like it's Gotham?
Startin' from the bottom, then work with stardom
Hit 'em with the anthem, words never forgotten
Modern-day marksman, Killa Bee squadron
Armed and dangerously crash the party
While he be toxi on dark Bakardi
Next thing you know, lights on time to go
Bitches cursin' niggas out, like they ain't got dough

 (x4)


Shoalin, Killa Hills, 1-0-3-0-4
Rebel I, terrify, S.I.N.Y
And what, tear the gut...



 + (Raekwon)
On the firing line... lock, one round load
Ready on the right? Ready on the left?
Ready on the firing line? Watch for ya targets
(Yeah, yeah, yeah...) pay attention


Welcome to the fish fry where niggas get burnt to a crisp
Jump out the pot, "Yeah yo I got this"
Long armor, construction's on, I'm pro-drama
Catch me in the wildest beefs, I bring bombers
Bearded like Talibans, booted, my black ninjas
'll come through, tuxedos on with the gold llamas
Priceless like emeralds, check out the ski mask
King Tut's nephew gave it to me for three bags
Of heron, Don Baron, sniff a bag of blow
Fifth out, runnin' up in Saks with the ill army
Shake feds, play dead, yo check out what Rae said
Lay on ya hands, let the Branson break bread
High energy, all my niggas a kin to me
Regardless how it go down I still get ten a ki
Beware of my enemies, y'all remember me
Nikes with the low goose on and I've been a beast
Wilding in my headphones, red in my stones
Good ganja out, if I die fill up my headstones
With water, dough, acid and gold classics
All my niggas who pump, the spirit'll jump out and grab shit
Max with the laser on 'em, staircase caskets (caskets)
Broke bugged thugs in the hallway maxing (maxing)

 + (movie sample)
Still them 1-6-Ooh niggas, straight up (whoa, hold up, hold up)


The nozzle aim rip through ya frame for pocket change
Fiend for the Rush Hour 4 then pop a vein
Thousand dollar corks pop, pause or get off top
Used to be a general, just lost your spot
Animal House, two grand'll handle ya mouth
Beast mode with the G-Code cancel 'em out
Son, I've seen Hell, fell into the palms of Satan arms
Don that I am made 'em bow in the face of God
Graveyard Shifting, different day, the same thing
The name ring then the chain swing and dames cling
Money green, Maury kicks, whips and new fitteds
(It was all a dream) Advocated by the few who do live it
Bloomberg make a nigga cop the Mausberg
Shorty ain't a shorty, he a shooter like Wahlberg
Old man told me, "Don't be blind to deception
Only strive for perfection homey, ya mind is a weapon"


Relax, you got ya muscles tight, relax
Word... Word...

 + (U-God)
First we told y'all niggas, then we showed y'all niggas, huh?
(We gon' take it back with this)
By the time you get a show, we've been all around the globe, huh?
(We gon' take it back with this)
Before you even had a name, you was screaming "Wu-Tang"
(We gon' take it back with this)
When we was running on the block, you was under ya pops, remember
(We gon' take it back with this... let's go)


Armor truck money, Shazam bangles, play the throne like
Julius Caesar, gorilla mob, slash, Killah's gaurd
Fake passports and visas, all of my goons
They be carrying spoons because boom he had a massive seizure
Hot chocolate lovers, guns is published
Detroit bitches out of town be dying to fuck us
This is real talk, shank lullabyes
Ben Franks, we like Jet Blue we stay hella high
Curl on the dumbell L, we can't even S-P-E-L-L
MTV or TRL's
Supreme novelists, we rank superior, guarding the post
Down low in the 'jects, got it locked in ya area
Ain't tryna hurry up
We like rebel niggas powdered up wilding in the streets of Liberia
No matter the crime, I'm beating the case
If I'm a wrong, a chair hit a judge right in his face
Shitting shanks out, come to court dates
Mittens on shines with blood Wally's that's the color of wine


Talk to me, my criminal mystique
Kick back the boards, six thousand a week
Pay homage, what the don beat, you're a minor threat
I see ya sweat roll down ya cheek
And ya soft and sweet, ya talk is pork
Get murdered in New York when I enforce the heat
And the cost ain't cheap, my advice is priceless
Bring back the life that ya thought was lifeless
The way of the gun, son, who the nicest?
S.K., no stun gun, smooth devices
Time crisis, I played the game, low lifers
In a brawl, ripped the phones out the walls in Rikers
Vipers in the infirmary rooms with slicers
Shiesters with hate in their blood might bite ya
Fuck that bitch if yo wife don't write ya
Cancel her, buy another one just like her
Pipers in the bucket of ice taste righteous
Today's mathematics when we build in cyphers
The baby automatic kill like Air Force strikers
I'm still Asiatic when I spill the hypeness


The dark, and this place will come here
That's right!






Im cold like Leonard Snart
Spark where predators mark
Any record that can shred it apart
Check the live talk, sidewalk slang, make your mind walk
Fire off my lines, pop off like ninety winecoff
Serve up rappers a side of fries with cole slaw
My crew hold it down like Hodor! Hodor!
Ultra magnetic, track record
Read it on Reddit, the heat is on, the beat is on set it
Deeper than Prince Namor
Chainsaw massacre half of the rappers whos claiming that they were
Hashtag cash bag, puff pass watch me spaz that
Hazmat rap, smash your mans swag
Czarface darts sharper than 
The template for new emcees to emulate
The bad man mad like marching the Pac 10
Catch me slow dancing with Scarlett Johansson


Kamikaze quotes I write like Ta-Nehisi Coates
Smooth like Muhammad Ali floats, get you on the ropes
This is jungle action, TChalla on you folks
Salvador Dali in the zone with the smokes
My cranium, negative vibes of vibranium aplenty
What kind of Wakanda are you staying in or living in
I keep it low key like Tom Hiddleston
My words carry weight like a triple chin
Feeling so focused now you can say Im a synonym for Ritalin
Well youre a synonym for simpleton
The only time you on stage when we waiting for the fans to trickle in
You aint fooling nobody man you got us giggling
Listen, I caught a body rap and no life bid
Because real killers move in silence like hybrids
We the fly kids, make your mind darker
Two Lukes on the mic, Cage and Skywalker

(S is for Skywalker)
(I love it, heh heh heh)
(Talk that talk)

Now the formula is this
Me, George, and INS
For those that cant count it goes, you know the rest
The emcee  big up is who we be
(Czarface) baby in the place to be





I make it rain not distributing cash, but like an Indian Dance
Really never gave the rhythm a chance
Still chained in the dungeons of rap, thunder clap
Get back, I spit facts, leaving blood on the track
Thats your highness  like Im attracted to light
Im on another plane like Im getting back on a flight
Deadly statements, sedate your mental stasis
Cause you nausea, temporal displacement
Jooks on the good look, tally the books
Burning Cali kush pushing through the valley of crooks
Czar Fonzareli, Czarface is what youre dealing with
Hazmat Rap, check your pulse you aint feeling this



Blacs is dope, flier than Snook off the top rope
Phantom of the Op swinging my cloak, chopping your throat
I know Im nice but dont gas me brah
All hail the Czar bringing action like Run Run Shaw
Blast it for you, wont run no more
Black Panther movie debut, Marvel Civil War
While you rolling through the ER, strapped to a gurney
Im strapped on a yacht with Czarface on another journey
I spark fires in the booth, the human torch couldnt burn me
Your final resting place is on a mantle in an urn G
Knick-Knack-paddy-whack get your jaw tapped
From Round house kicks cracking through your thorax



Im hanging out the window of a stolen Corolla
Holding a hammer so berserk all my verses touch you like Boba
Ill acupuncture your skull then Ill actually punch your nose
Accuracy of blows, make you actually touch your toes
Imagine Baron Zemo directed by Tarantino
Now imagine Czarface crushing him like a glass of vino
Ill put your gal up on tracks like a palomino
Now shes lifted, and hes gifted
On my high horse like Seabiscuit when the weeds twisted
Im rhyming on a 60 foot boat and I glisten and glow
Tighter than your grip on your phone
And its like the NBA commissioner spoken cause I get at it
With my silver tongue official like a whistle is blowing
Pull up, like Golden State in the transitional motion
I got a mechanical mind, with an outstanding design
Thatll last through the annals of time
Each lines mad titan, word Im the Thanos of rhyme
With fans wall to wall like how tarantulas climb




Four wheelers, pop the hatch and blast that hitter
Honey times, money hurry, snap that picture
I wanna see the walls come down, if ya'll bout it
For New York, I cover the sport, like Marv Albert
One, two, when I exhale, the one-two
Lock it down, similar to Denzel in John Q
Fire the semi, with no ice, no Bentley
I'm just low fitty, throwin' limes in the Remy
There's so many fraud, how could you call that real?
I supply fire that'll forge the steel
Can't ignore the real, yeah ya forced the deal (With who?)
With that nigga, that kid, you're sure to feel
Big money, big guns, big cars and all
Rocked Halle on the floor at the Monster's Ball
From the 718 to the 310
Underdawgz, U.D,'s, the unsung heroes


They see me in the streets they be like (That's that nigga)
Rebel I.N.S., ya'll know (That's that nigga)
Girls of the world be sayin' (That's that nigga)
All across the board they goin' (That's that nigga)
Girls of the world say (That's that nigga)
All across the board they goin' (That's that nigga)
They see him in the streets they be like (That's that nigga)
Rebel I.N.S., ya'll know (That's that nigga)


The Movement, follow my lead, clock my speed
Number one with a bullet, that's cocked to squeeze
He's artist of the year, who can touch me son?
Like Jimmy Castor, trust me, I've just begun
And I won't stop, hoggin' the lane, droppin' my game
My dogs be, rockin' them chains, poppin' the same
In the distance, hawkin' my style, talkin' loud
Non-believers wonder how I'm talk of the town
Hate Me Now, like Puffy and Nas, I uprise
Never thought big guns would survive, but surprise
Now what nigga? Only drugs sell quicker
Been chained in the dungeons of rap and held prisoner
You'll find me, cruisin' the Ave., tool in the stash
My tomb blast you in the smash, movin' the mass
I'm comin' like the taxman for all their business
I'm bound by my honor, so ya'll bear witness




A Titan like Steve McNair, be prepared
For the Top Gun, smokin' like weed in the air
Please beware, the Underdawgz roam in the yard
Postin' hard, approachin' get you closer to God
This is real life money, not a scene from a movie
U.D.'s tighter than the jeans on a hoochie
The groupies crowd around the 6 point O
If it's like that now, wait til this joint blow
Tell the world, the prophet has come, problem for some
The masses, holla for son, hot as the sun
That keep your eyes open don't you get caught sleepin'
Your boy get you bouncin' like a six four leanin'






Wu, Shaolin, yeah, yeah
Lets stand up y'all
What up, we on the rise
10304 types
Move with The Movement
Its like Roy Jones said
What's that son
Y'all must of forgot or sutten word
Yo INS


We love fast cash, trickin' on a few girls
Spazzin' like the yellow cab, through the new world
I walk slow, slaughter order like new kicks
On some Wu shit, two chicks shootin' my flicks
Might creep through ya town all wrong
Half a bone, twenty inch chrome
Illuminatin' off ya dome
Like OT status, the one to get at
Never sweat that, I'm focused at the X on the map
Treasure chest stash, the guest house attached
Forty acres and a mule with the sawed off gat
Fuck the media hype, I'm into Stereotype
Name ya price, then let me get my hand on the dice
All my life, nine out of ten involved in the heist
Only for ayallytes with the target sliced
Now the parasite blined by your neon light
Tryna eat right so maybe I can sleep nights, yo see


Heads get ripe off-a this
Thug all night off-a this
Ladies fight off-a this
This is That Shit
The Projects flip off-a this
The trees get lent off-a this
Crash your whip off-a this
Cuz this is That Shit


Yeah yeah, niggas stay showin' they teeth, knowin' they weak
We supply you with the fire son, cope with the heat
Roamin' the streets, slowin' the Jeeps, ownin' the beat
No sleep, chasin' papers, stay focused, it's deep
Keep an eye on boy, he gonna rise like the crime rate
Vibrate the tristate, I make ya jaw aque
Been around the world, put a house on the hill
But still greasy like the corner store grill
We roll like Vegas dice, pay the price
Watch me roll straight strikes in this game of life
See me, yankee hats, John John, blue boots on
Movin' in the Ucon, schoolin' all the new borns
Mommy get ya groove on, ya bustin' out ya outfit
Lovin' how ya move on the floor, baby bounce it
Big boys step through, they all step aside
They all mesmurised man, y'all recognise




Heads get ripe off-a this
Some will bite this, Rebel INS your highness
Screamin' high pitched, survivalist you bare a likeness
In the pits where it's high risk, I work the Nightshift
Like this, like that, put pressure on rap
Cheques stack, watch a sex trap
Shorty through an X in my 'yac
Caddy stretched black, don't question the fact
I lay my head back, spazzin' off a new Meth track
Count weed, bag green, blue, purple and brown
Crown King with my down Queen lurkin' the town
Circle round, get a glimpse of the kid gettin' big
Feel that, I peel back, heavy into ya wig
For the fugitives and big timers throwin' bricks
Plus the plot thugs locked up proven to this
Son hit it like Arabs, the world don't curb haters
Don't quit ya day job, ya girl know the words






Uh-huh, Ruthless

Eh yo, my fam's desperate
When it get real, we let the tech spit
We like AIDS for those who think they can't catch this
We manifested this rap shit, we could go beyond this rap shit
Let the gat spit, buck that hatchet
You fake rap was malpractice, let me get at this
And show you where the fuck you lack is
These Bastards is like Cassius Clay with the gun play
It's like drivin your car down a one-way
You bound to get hit, my style is legit'
Nigga, wildin ain't shit, cuz I can do that and do this
But I analyze, niggas chit chat, I plan to rise
Yo, my fam is live, livin this life, we still fantasize
About the better life and all that real cheddar
Cuz we forever trife, that shit'll make me feel better
I be Infrared, niggas keep y'all guns in y'all holsters
I'm out for the bread, so I make lead jump out the toaster
I keep my people closer, closer than you'll ever get
Niggas is delicate, bomb like a gun, you never spit


We the authentic, far from counterfeit
Bound to hit, me and my Shaolin click
Son they talk shit, but they forever forfeit
Bangin with the Blaquesmiths, kid, we want fish


Eh yo, we blow hydro, hit hoes and tag toes
Fo'-fo's put holes in Parasucos
I used to hustle on the block, holdin crack in my asshole
Now I do shows, sip the Crist', forget the Moe's
Watch my back, for Colombo's and Donnie Brasco's
Droppin tops on convertibles, lyrically murder you
Who are you? I never heard of you, verbally servin you
I analyze 'em then I size 'em up, where's the rope? Tie 'em up
Gag his mouth, shut him up, Ruthless Bastards don't give a fuck
I run up in your mansion, hold your family for ransom
When I'm twisted off Branson, too thugged out for dancin
You'll niggas askin for Sha to jump in a stolen Maxima
I drive by clappin ya, pay attention when I'm after ya

	"Hip-hop is writin and rhymin, a way of life
	 To hold the mic in your hand and crush everything
	 in front of you, that's hip-hop."


Caught in collisions, niggas cut you 'cisions with razors
Little league niggas bleed from fuckin with the majors
This wild life's contagious, in guns we trust
And if they're aimin at my team then ain't no more to discuss
I charge to bust, goons from my platoon to bang
Shook them thangs and watch shots come back like boomerangs
Orangutangs swingin through this concrete jungle
Slangin them thangs, bummy with grimy niggas in the struggle
Either we love you or hate you, half the shit y'all can't relate to
Like niggas actin like you feel just to snake you
Scientific breakthrough, your flow's infested with cyanide
When I die screamin "Fuck the world!", I lease 'em high
Beast from SI, fuck with my peeps from I, increase the crime
When I release the nine, tryin to teach the blind to shine




Yo, yo, yo, ill greed general, war platoon steez
On the battlefield stripes get stripped off your sleeves
They bleed like we bleed, I fiend for the cheese
Just like you, in order to feed my seeds
No remorse, so I'm forced to bring forth the flames
No game, engrave out my name into your brain
The nobel, Sir I, rap mogul
Move global on you locals, blow em when I've come through
Hundred deep, nuff heat stashed in the Jeep
On the creap, like broken floodin the streets
Yo, this is for my niggas who post on live corners
The brawlers who keep they hands on the nine Taurus
Straight out the woods, hit the hoods like a taskforce
Mass force, pullin the sting, take the cash off




Son they talk shit but they forever forfeit
Bangin with the Blaquesmiths kid we want fish




Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Manhattan
And Staten, and Staten, and Staten, and Staten


I'm from New York City, birthplace of the gritty
Dog eat dog, only jakes willing to work with me
Watch your back 'fore they lace your sizurp with a mickey
Bodies'll burn like dub sacks of purple sticky
Kojaks developing Kodaks of your meeting engagements
The young guns put pressure on the made men
The fiends'll, they'll cap you for your package
The mass act savage, living sis selling her ass and tits
Your best friend'll send shots to wet ya
The badlands, hammers on the waistband, the regular
Trapped in this hood dwelling, selling five and dime
Cuz ain't 9 to 5 for two-time felons
And little man wanna be just like me
The sadness thing, he just might be
Where the livest, Christiopher Walken, King of New York, and
Resort to talking when the heaters on him, grieving on him




Ol' blue eyes said, "you make it here, you make it anywhere"
Drug wars for every square, bloodsport, the semi's air
Now watch where you walk through, watch who you talk to
Watch the young Gotti's, the'll off you
It's like the mafia plot
The fishermen they find more bodies then cops
But the shots don't stop trynna get it get it
Inside where the broads and the ballers kick it
Big city lights, with chicks and ice
You living, you victim to them sick gritty types
Drooling with their tongues out, guns out, spraying clips
Who lay in the pits and pray for a taste of it
If you can sleep you awaken by the loud sound
Of barking chrome, sound foul but I call it home
So keep heat when on the roam, speak brief when on the phone
In these mean streets you all alone






Yeah, major players of the game, still swinging
I'm up to bat again, ya'll already know
Barry Bonds flow, out of the park with it (Mental Instruments)
Let's go


You run through the competition, they treat you like a champ
When you winning and you make it to the big game
Dive in a pile of riches, fly bitches
Chain fridged when you, make it to the big game
Get money, big money, big fame
Spot packed out, and the fans entertained
They like me, we go hard when we play
And that's how the fuck you get to make it to the big game


Early on the paper route, blood on my hands
Cannons and lasers out, cool as a fan standing in Satan's house
Show 'em what my name about, boss of myself
Turning your lady out, talk is cheap, shut up, pay me now
Hands on the dice work, stopping your bank
Shorty you're light work, Comic View rap making my side hurt
Talent's in the mic worse, drama to rank
Feels like my life cursed, down to go out, what's the price worth
Seats leaning with the rod held tight
In the BMW g'ing with the Roswell lights
I spit gemstars, splitting your dome and I double up
Everything, heavy swing, bringing 'em home
So I'm sitting like a king on the throne, like I used to be
The right hand, now I got a thing on my own
Showing love for all my ringers home, quoting my name
You niggas been a clone, homey can't swing in my zone




Revolvers with the lazy eye, late for my plate frame
You crazy fly, screw the tip off, jump in the baby I
More papers, law makers, all of us jaw breakers is on
Vaticans in action in all ages
All my teams armored, from all the way to bulletproof socks
Hit me in the calf, it's no option
I won't fold, destined to make bail
Call up my Norfolk niggas, tip that bill, we can't play jail
No time for RICOs, kids ego
Fucked up the game, that's like sticking your eye next to the peephole
The next generation of dumb niggas, we built the legacy
These bum niggas, got invaded by slum niggas
All mine battling, we gonna battle for mansions
Branson and more bottles of Gallo
A villain slash genetleman, blowing with nine thousand Indians
I'm the Chief, this the millennium




After all that I been through, critiquing all that the kid do
The moral though, I'mma continue
We hungry, son, you ain't seen gully
You Wesley at the Carter, New Jack City, you G-Money
I beast money, feet stay fresh off the runway
Hotter than a summer day sunray, I must say
Truth like a Bible page, twenty flow said night or day
Twenty warheads at you right away
Play maker A-gamer'll sell the house out, silence the nay sayer
Throw a shout out, to all my major players
Deck take it out the park, Barry Bonds stance
They wonder, damn is his performance enhanced?
Rumble in the jungle, blind to the pressure
See, son's cool, million to one odds, he come through
I leave your trunk blue, holding your head, stuck off the one-two
Turn up the game, I just begun to




Live and direct, Staten Island 10304
USA, all the way to muthafucking Africa
Back to Pinkin Avenue



* multiple gunshots *


Yo, when we do this, we do it for real
We do it for the love, we do it for the money
For the cash, for the women, the birds
We do it for the foundation, for the people
No matter how we do it, we do it for The Cause
Yea, yo


What you in for? What you live for?
What you die for? I hope its for The Cause
..
What you work for? What you stand for?
What you strive for? I hope its for The Cause


Inspectah, rhyme beretta nine in ya sector
Wet the scenery with extreme measures
Supreme lecture, bless the heads, you dare enter
The 9th Chamber, dance with the mind bender
Surrender your thrown, there's no room for pretenders
Bystander pollyin worldwide with nine members
Distributin, my verbal sharp shootin
While I execute the deadliest moves with fine tunin
Duel of the Iron Mic bound to spark fusion
Movin at the speed of light, nice at what I'm doin
Drop it in ya brain like spice, without the five mics
Heads roll off hilltops when I strike
Sniper aim, stick you up for your price of fame
Like the flame, watch you get hot inside the game
Recognize my name, I.N.S., your highness
I rep for live sets, place ya bets, make ya threats
There's no cure, even the experts are stunned
My work is done as soon as I've just begun *echo*




Strictly, Streetlife, I never play a fan of the fame
Just build on my name, and master the slang
I'm hittin harder than a lot of artists in the game
I'm lyrically inclined, rockin just the same
Than any MC who ship platinum or gold
And only recoup to pay back what you sold
Over budget your video, got pimped like a ho
My niggas move slo-mo like robotic clones
I'd rather be alive and paid, than dead broke
My life is like a thin line, on a tight rope
A fiend with no dope, wrong way to provoke
The man behind the scope, tucked, ready to smoke
]From the same place you from, different hood, the same slum
Mother's third seed, father's first son
Bastard child runnin wild, livin foul
Ran into some juvenile niggas in design
P.L.O. Style, sign my name on the dotten line
Your beef is mine, dangerous minds combine, we all carry nines *echo*




Hitman like Thomas Hearns, bustin while the weed burns
Shorty, sixteen, yearns for my crew to take turns
I'm a loose cannon, medically examined
Found deadly as a plague, soon to spread like famine
Splurgin, livin out the dirty version
Throwin rocks at the ghetto birds circlin the urban
Workin overtime, you notice the shine
Niggas scope mine, models won't work Capone nine


We travel in pairs, you got the front, I watch the rear
Got money on my mind this year, by all means
Put an end to your cold stairs, crush your small dreams
What you hear is the truth, fuck what you used to
I provide you with street music you can ride to
Push through, sound blastin through the sun roof
Street surfer, lurkin, thirsty for the loot
I'm in it to fuck fans and rock mic stands
I work for cash and fans, and die for the Clan




He's been taking it easy, and then suddenly the moment came
Suddenly, the moment came, watch it, and...
He has put together a flurry and put the champion away
But no one has ever been able to do that
And he's trynna survive to the final bell, what a fight

You never will conquer the champion
You never will conquer the champion


I stream machine gun funk, trump slayer
Major Payne game hunter, summer time shine
Mind controller, hold the crowd still hill top dweller
Sell the garden out, House Gang chain
Cuban Link blink, lose shoes, you can never wear
Stare hard, God rise above, love hate, make your choice
Voice like Luther, future Hall of Famer
Came a long way, stay fly, I, soldier, Ayatollah
Airbender send a chill, drill sarge, hard bottom
Got 'em hooked, took my time, grind heavy
Ready for the world, girl please, he's too experienced
Been a don, Avalon size, wise to it
Do it like, Nike type gritty, city boy, 'noid never
Better recognize, eyes of the tiger
The fire breather, he the truth, son
The champion


You never will conquer the champion
You never will conquer the champion


This is Ruger rap, clap clips, strips buzzing
Cousin got the spot a blaze, J's crisp, this time styling
Island of Stat, Black Hawk, walk with me, fifty cal flow
Blow the roof, you learn, burn unit
True it's popping, watch 'em work, purp' smoking, toke and rapping
Catch a tidal wave, slave to the rhythm, give 'em hell
Bell ringer, Springer Show, throw a chair, air it out
Doubting Deck, check your pulse, folks, witness history
Rewriting the script, switch it on 'em, taught 'em how
Now's a new day, say what? Clutch shooter
Through the storm, calm bomb, armed dangerous, spit game
Flame thrower, Cobra Commander, pandemonium, it's only him
Swim with the sharks, spark like night breeze
See plan the camera flash, cash only homey
And not jammed til the band done, the champion


You never will conquer the champion
You never will conquer the champion




You gotta get up, you gotta get out
Get from under, it's time to get over
Get right, or get left, get even with the odds
Get yours, Solomon...


Eight million stories in the naked city, New York City
You make it, they'll take it quickly
Ask Po & Richie, coke sold blow you over fifty
I know who with me, I know you won't trick me
I'm O.G., stuck to the code G
You can never break him or take him alive
You can never face him or trace the design
Believe me breathing, guaranteed I'll make the way to survive
And built with such grace and strive
That from all those who sore mention him with the greats of his time
Before I sign off, salute
To every soldier, major player or crime boss
We not taking time off
It's harder to hustle, I must get mine off
Mandatory, the story concludes
And according to Wu, you know Cash Rules Everything


I want it now, and ain't got time to waste
And even though they say crime don't pay
It's got to be a better way, they thinking more like 10 years
I'm thinking more like 10 days


Yeah, I shook up the city, trap star of the city
Had the best work in the city, had the flyest broad in the city
Ran with some of the flyest niggas in the city
Til they left me for dead in the city, with no water
Left me to dehydrate in the city
Money supply, went short in the city
The wise tell me, money can't buy love
But what's funny is love can't survive without money
Nowadays in my poverty city, but I love my city
And I'll be damned if I lay down and die in the city
Never, cuz in order to rise, you gotta fall in the city
But the mission is you get up when you fall in the city




Yeah, Ayatollah, Heroin
K.M.G., Young Wu-Tang
Hustle hard, nigga




That's black? Whattup God?
Aiyyo Shorty got beef with that nigga? Word?
 Oh shit!!! Yo!
Hold the fuck up


Aiyyo yo, eight niggas down (just enough)
Fuckin around with my sound (ci-ty)
Yo, bring backup (ci-ty)
Fuckin with me, and mine
Murderous, check it, yo


The world is shifty, we living just enough for the city
The rough witty Killa Bee sting just like the jiggy
My Family Stone, foes attempt to gradually clone
Labelled MIA and I send the casualties home
In closed coffins, Wu storming like the light brigade
Ride the wave like Frankie Avalon inside the cyber age
Crime pays, the law's long arm be tryna strong arm
Walking time-bombs who thrive on firearms
The charm smoker, I hit the dread with a poster
We told 'em to show him love and exposed the black toaster
Composer was shook, I took your bad looks for joke
Get your back broke, deep throat this Murder, I Wrote
The antidote be seeking like a buried treasure
By every measure lethally inject your whole sector
Wanted Dead or Alive, Rebel I escapes
Across the desert sand, leaving no footprints to trace
Keep a war face, your place conceal the baby knives
On the North breaks, I still shine in shady times


We living just enough (living just enough)
Just enough for the city) (for the city)
Just enough for the city


Yo, In the jungle, I make moves like Iron Monkey
Plots to bump me off, D.O.C. be on the hunt for me
We stay hungry for money drugs and guns
Ones who fake get caught in the crossfire for crumbs
Know the science be my guidance
The facts tell, gats sell like sex and violence
And break the project silence, a vision
This is way beyond four corners, escape this mental prison
Before we're all goners, now embrace the world
For the world war is ocean bomber, visionary soldier karma
My code of honor, mind still scarred from the drama
Trauma sent to victim, witness them run, scream in horror
Military chopper come gun down the slum
The outcome do or die son, it's bound to come
Mentally aware I see truth within the square
The future's here catch me on computer software
Warfare's inevitable, Rebel I hold several government official
Issue thirty-eight specials, that step through
Like Nat Turner create a spectacle
I may die in the scuffle but I'm taking forty devils


We livin just enough
Just enough
Just enough
For the ci-ty


Killa Beez, stinging MCs
Yeahhh, Wu






Young Krizzle that nigga they never rule out
Goin' forward, hit like Thor, what movin' you 'bout?
Lot of niggas claimin' MC's won't stand the test of time
Thank God I was blessed to rhyme the way that would reflect the shine
Lights on the southern country folk
Know they hatin' when I'm bassin', knockin' pots up off their porch
Window tinted, got me hidden, creepin', crawlin' like a float
Or parade, grippin' grain and chariots on them spokes
Spartacus couldn't spar with us, true gladiators
I had concubines way before I had paper
Tryna live in high rises, Mount Olympus krill
This ain't even my spot, it's just some simple shit
Got a couple Medusas that keep me rock hard
These niggas optical illusions, they are not stars
If it ain't that GQ then it's not ours
Fuck that bullshit, bitch, I'm 'bout war
Hope you're 'bout yours


I'm one man against the world
Remember this forever
The king of my kingdom
Bring it to 'em raw
Ready for war
That's how you bring it


Ayo I spit sick, it's Term the ill spick
Here to rip shit down with Villa and Big K.R.I.T
It's the gambino, callin' in shots like Rick Pitino
In the Benzito, hustle for ends, and Bens, c-notes
I'm in the villa with Villa, bumpin' that Dilla
Pop a pill or crack a fill and just listen to how I kill it
Yo your boy's chill, but my chain is chilly, chilla Charles Manson
Choppin' bodies and throw 'em in the river
I be head huntin', puttin' hundreds on your head
Hollow heads have you singin' Hail Marys in your bed
See the bloodshed? Ain't a blood but I love red
I be blackin' out, wakin' up runnin' away from feds
Went from Beantown, Chi Town to Mississippi
Got killers with me flippin' them 50 cals, gettin' busy
Ain't a thing pretty, I'm prolly goin' to Hell too
And when I do I'll be chillin' with Pun and L too
But I'ma let my man Pun tell you




Game of thrones, king of the north, that's how my name is known
Play bold, off with your head soon as the blade is shown
No chaperon, you alone in the battle zone
Dome blower, lightin' up the room like bad cologne
I spit piff, still kill you with the stress line
See a sigh on the set whenever Deck rhymes
I be closin' on bread, just like a bread tie
Reppin' SI, do or die, NY
Ridiculous game, my slang tastin' big and gross
Thirty chicks on their period ain't got a sicker flow
Three chicks alone, I spend about what you get a show
You still runnin' behind your man like a pick and roll
Call me the general, there's blood on my stripes
Mud on my Nikes, the struggle made me double the price
I'm nothin' nice, I shake 'em like a couple of dice
Wanna ride with a nigga, better buckle up tight


There's a code! Your clan tried to kill me, now I'll kill all of you! I warned you! You have no chance!





Through the eyes the windows to the soul
Seeing visions of gold
Glory or gory? Still a story is told
Where there's hate for the hero
And the villains are god
'till fate revealed his card
Hes still feelin' it hard
Now i don't believe in magic ,witchcraft or voodoo
Just karma, the things you do come back to you
Third eye wide survive
Try to stay alive
Make a way
Just to say
You lived before you died
Look ahead with faith,not back with regrets
Blessed,safe travels on your path to success





You gotta have love for yourself
Before you love something else
The feeling itself
Could be harmful to health
Trust is a luxury
Earned by respect and loyalty
The honor make it to next to royalty
Some stand in the sun their skin begin peeling
Blind to the truth
Battling with inner demons
Poison in the brain
Sure they going insane
Maintain through the joy and the pain
Its like all we know
Bless the children before we go
Love is love, that's at least how the story go






Oh yeah, coming through with my Shaolin crew
Two cent for a case, gimme St. Ide's brew
In the midst of broken bottles and crushed up cans
Methtical's in a jam, oh how dry I am
With St. Ides in my system
Crack another I'm blessed, let's go get the next one
And get over, the object is to stay sober
Lay on the sofa, better yet, dial my chauffeur
Call me the Wallabee Champ, stretched out, could never be Son
Ricochet daily hit the deli for a cold one
Naturally blessed, yes, my rap is like a laser beam
Laser beam, laser beam, laser beam...


Uh, uh, uh
Sing


So we all got children, products of the ghetto
Momma cooked the soup, daddy did the yelling
Uncle was a drunk, cousin was a felon
When he got pitched, he told them he wasn't tellin'
Auntie was a cook, her husband was a crook
Cause every job he had they be payin' him off the books
Ghetto university, knowledge is all it took
In a tenement I was listenin' to the hook
Change gon' come, the spirit of Sam Cooke
When the feds comin', everybody be shook
Now we doin' life like Eddie Murphy and Martin
On the chain gang, I was singing into the coffin


The roaches and the rats, heroin and the cracks
Couldn't blame me, I'm just giving the facts
I'm tryna hit the top, cause' bottom ain't where it's at
Everybody got a past but you can never go back


Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Sing)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Sing)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Sing)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Sing)


Tellin' you like it is, how we ever gon' live?
If we ain't gettin' money, how we feedin' the kids?
It's a revolving door, where brothers be doin' bids
I know it sound wrong but the door will be what it is
Survival of the fittest, this poor girl the illest
Broke parents and black cats give me heebie-geebies
Life seems hard but nothin' ever comes easy
Whatever's in the dark, can always become the light
If you ain't in a battle, how you gon' win the fight?
I gotta speak the truth when I'm up in the booth
The streets be flyin' birds but they don't be on the roof
Poverty is a pain like you pullin' a tooth
Told the streets don't let me go like I'm Bishop in Juice


Roaches and the rats, heroin and the cracks
Couldn't blame me, I'm just giving the facts
Tryna hit the top, the bottom ain't where it's at
Everybody got a past but you can never go back


Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
(Gotta sing)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)


Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Sing)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Sing)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gotta sing)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(She's a king)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
And they sing New York City
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah




Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the lyrical grand prix
We have our drivers racin for a $3,000,000 purse
Winner takes all, gentlemen start your engines...


Give me room, hit the tune
Feature presentation coming soon, early June
Killa Bee platoon, well groomed
Spells doom, raise the volume
You react like a werewolf in a full moon
With the force of a Trojan horse
Pushing forward, have your seat belt fastened
We blasting into orbit, Wu restore the new chamber
Wu-Banga number 9, expert precision and design
Mastermind the plan took a matter of time
From the confines of the cold world I shine
It's amazin, the grace, changin in the place
Blazin the brakes, invadin your space
Which remains in the race, claimin first place
Raisin the stakes, it's a game to disgrace
I hold many jewels, drop more than I wear
I come in peace, prepare for the warfare
The invincible fold, when they're caught in the square
And the talk mad shit when the coast is clear


Yes, ladies and gentlemen
We've just completed the first lap


Blood kin, knowledge, knowledge, I build with rap scholars
Guns and wallets, prowess, Staten Island stylist
12 men roster, live long, prosper
Street philosopher, you end up like Jimmy Hoffa
Ain't a damn thing changed but the aim, bullet range
Strange universe, I was nursed to blow your mainframe
Think first, convert, all verse live in concert
Pull a skirt, burst, while y'all niggas star search
Mind yours, why you eyeing mines for
Posing like a matador, I must got something you wanna die for
Touch mine, reach him up, his headline, both grant
9 inch rusty splint push through your nose is vent
Got my eyes on the grand prize, place your bet
Watch me win it by a landslide, pull off an upset
Hold the burner close by my hands and my pocket
Hold the trophy high and keep my eyes on the prophet


And a new driver has entered the contest
Ladies and gentlemen, driver number 99
In the red car...


Fog lights beam, car 99 supreme
A high-powered machine spits sparks of baroline
The smell of gasoline, motor roar, the crowd roars
The rag tuck rip, box cut caught in my jaws
Enforcing my laws, ramrod in my garage
The grease lightning, dusty rose, shake him, bon voyage
Now duel of the iron, flying feud for you writers
The speed demon, rebel talk, triggers, freedom fighters
Was tracked in the cock pit, I'm writing exact
I'm crushing corners, who that kid riding the track
With the Wu helmet, 6th nigga, 5 cars track
The last but not least, I bliss through the scrimmage
No brakes, I dart, I'm racing for the finish
Understand my hunger for my land down under
It's the thunderous rush, after the sounds get crush
The purse snatching pound, by all means snatch cream
Tear your ass out of town


As we near the final lap
Team Wu-Tang seems to be buildin
A sizeable lead on the competition


Yo, I know how to fold 'em like Kenny Rogers
Popular demand, overstand these piranhas
Moving on the track like a Monaco GT
I stand out similar to 3D on your TV
Easily breezing watching the speed dial climb
Style of rhyme, left the foes miles behind
Leaving skid marks on the charts
Aimed at the hearts of the fake, sparked on the tapes
It's starts from the gate, darts penetrate
Freestyle as the decoy to sharpen the bait
Holding major weight, my Supreme Team dominates
Circulating, taking all bets you place
In and out of state, twirling L's on the freeway
NY to SC, NC to VA, GA to MD, CA to KY
FL to IL, TX to MI


As we near the checkered flake, ladies and gentlemen
Team Wu-Tang's holding down the 1st, 2nd and 3rd positions
And it looks like it's goin to be another sure win for Team Wu-Tang
As they take home another pot of gold with this $3,000,000 purse
Rebel INS, U-God, Street Life

Get the loot, get the loot
Cash money y'all, cash money y'all, cash money y'all




They say the first blow stuns you
The second one, that's the KO
My knuckles 'bout to hurt, going in


Y'all don't want it with Deck
You know anything I drop will never fall short of respect
Y'all the type that they sorta respect
I'm a war vet
Off with your head once they forward the check
Yup, the cream keep calling me back
Never falling to trap
I flee the scene with your broad in my lap
And I ain't worried 'bout half of the chat
Haters talk 'til you see 'em
That's when they try 
Keep a wise mind writing his act
Don't even try to react
Tony Stewart how I'm riding the track
Even if you don't vibe to my rap
I still be on your dome like a snapback, fasten your straps
The rebel how they said I act, no lie
Like I work for Home Pride all the bread I stack
Call the jet to a west-side flat to relax
Left with the stewardess on the red-eye back


See I'm straight, y'all got it twisted
I'm great, y'all not as gifted
See I'm straight, y'all got it twisted
I'm great, y'all not as gifted


Beside man, relax
Stand up, straighten your back out

Realize it man
He made some good fertilizer, fam
It's what I said as I tied his hands and feet to a post on a random street
Then I chop his little body up into sandwich meat
I'm flying handsome version of Bryan Cranston
Holding a cop for ransom
Open up my demands and clean it out
But keep every bit of the finer ransom
And make some giant bands that want this wild anthem
A phantom pteranodon
Quick, turn the cameras on
Get a pic with him or the dying rapper he's landing on
As he turns the ghost cannon on
Says he bought it on Amazon
Now tell me what the fuck are you planning on? (Nothing)
Damn, he strong, can't be wrong
Airheads out like the candy's gone
It's CZARFACE, back to attack your heart again
Destroy your ass like Drax from the Guardians
CZARFACE is here, we got you


See I'm straight, y'all got it twisted
I'm great, y'all not as gifted
See I'm straight, y'all got it twisted
I'm great, y'all not as gifted




Ye-yeah
Smooth like a green Caddy, ya fiend badly
Heads spin like Giovanni's on the Navi
Hammers spit, quick as the darts, niggas part
Like the Red Sea, test me, I'm sick with the art
Been held back, it's either rap or sell smack
Black Knight like Martin Lawrence run tell that
It's the I-N-S-P-E-C-T-A-H
Livin' life on the line, I hope I see daybreak
This is ground level, rounds echo out the Special
Be easy, U.D.'s out to get you
Throw it in the smash (so fast)
Known to spaz (go ass)
We like strippers makin' niggas (throw cash)
Smoke the blue green (call it topaz)
Fake thugs (hold ass)
You be the next rapper (fallin on ass)
Wanna measure my size? I rise above the norm
The urban icon ridin' on the eye of the storm, fool


All my people from the front to back
If you want it like that just.. MOVE!
Get ill, no time to chill
Yo, you feel what I feel then.. MOVE!
Girlfriend, you love how it sounds
Put ya drink down and.. MOVE!
COME ON! COME ON! COME ON! COME ON!


What ya do now, put ya loot down
You can bet it on the new sound
Heavy like a Hummer on deuce pounds
True hounds, on the loose in ya town
Bound to the move the crowd, it's The Movement (you down?)
Scream at the top of ya lungs
Pop one for Aaliyah, Left Eye, BIG, 'Pac and Pun
Ride with me shotgun, rock with son
Heads bop to the drums, still shocked and stunned
Come alive y'all, gangsta like white walls
On the blue Snoop Deville, watch ya eyeballs
Blade stay choppin' the track, game top of the pack
I spit flames y'all acknowledge the fact
Find out Big Rug get it poppin' like that
Throw it down like Stackhouse, cockin' it back
So ladies? Is you wit me now? Don't fake down
Everybody brace yaselves, it's a shakedown




I do this for dough, but it's really for love
Feel me, it's love for hot girls, willies and thugs
My groups cross seas, call us junglin' thugs
And it's sure to move ya feet like a gun in the club
I blaze like a ounce and a half, stay countin' the cash
For all lames that doubtin' my craft
He's no pretender, he won't surrender
(He's a rebel) Don't y'all remember?
A major player in the game
Play the frontline, ain't afraid to make a change
I stay way beyond range
So far from the norm my code name's Doc Strange
Now get down with the get down
Sendin' missles to all my dogs in the big house
Make 'em wig out, Spiderman still on the web
Log on like ya clickin' the mouse, yeah!






This is the greatest story never told
The life and times, seventh episode
Based on a dad that I've never known
Mama raised me to hold my own, but I went against the grain
The tracks of a tear, show's the pain
Trapped in cage with the shackles and chains, I lost my grip
Try to handle the game, through the fire, didn't happen to change
You can try and kick it with him, I ain't listen, I was trapped in my way
Young and dumb, buzzing off that 151 Proof
Backshotting shorty on the project roof
Wow, look at him now, came a long ways from the hallways
Coppin' on four, 4 and Broadway
I was 16, working the triple beam
Catch a vick, jack a whip, anything getting this CREAM
The fiends had him falling in love, and the fiend became me
I needed more than drugs


If you look in my eyes, you see what I see
Take a look at my life, you see why I'm me
Everyday on the grind, I"m fiending my seed
Try to seek out at dying, that's where you'll find me


I heard the homey say, this can't be life, this can't be us
He can't be right, or maybe it's true, or maybe it's you
I say it's the devil and all the things that he persuade me to do
I'm holding back just for making the news, chasing haze with the booze
Doing the tango while they playing the blues
Loose cannon, attracted to the neon
Little RC stepping up with his G on, he on
I learned from the corner dons, the cops, the cons
The sugar daddies, the tricks, the johns
I was quick to get involved, addicted to it all
Got MY GED behind the prison walls
I risked death just to rep where I'm from
I got slapped in the head with the gun
Second to none, perfection with my kids it become
Cynthia's son, forgive me for the sins that I've done




Sleepless nights, vampire fiesting on the darkness
How could I see the light?
Grown-ups try to lead them right
Still catching felonies, they telling me, everything gon' be alright
I'm like, I ain't try to play the fool, I just want a plate of food
Pay my dues, hustling to make to make it through
I'm same as you, but I'm considered lucky
Cuz my buddy's in the grave should of made it too
The stress and the pain, my lifestyle destined to change
Lord bless him for the rest of his days
May he be everything that he say, give him strength to be a leader
Or to lead him astray, the sheep or the pray
Mama used to say believe in this day
Situations force people to change, I"m so deep in the game
I will never be the same
The devil be the blame, that's the reason I sing






Hey, lace your boots up, tracks get looped up
The chocolate deluxe gets scooped up
All my pigeons is cooped up, Wus up, Ws up
If you aint with us, chuck a duce up, and let us do us
Break a promise but not my group up
Veterans is dying and used up
Lets see if they can hang, Im already tying the noose up
Im too hot, if you not, get you stuffed
Get you touched and get you shot or you cut
Young buck Im just trying to toughen you up
Cant let you hustle with us, ya aint struggled enough
Yall been cuddled too much, maybe mothered too much
So the burner giving out loans here is a couple of bucks
Had a couple of scuffs, I aint saying Im perfect
I aint cursing on the rhyme but I wrote it in cursive
Quote the verses, boy I flow with a purpose
Get that proMeth and a soda, come with the purchase


Who is that up in the building?
Hashtag we still win
Raekwon no relation to Chef tho, but still trend
My youngun tell em its them
Wu-Tang is for the children
They bugging, tell em again
Wu-Tang is for the children


Lab with the pole, slide down, Im in the basement counting faces
Drunk on the slouch, count the spaceships
Jewelry to my knee caps, breathe stacks whores & sleestaks
HSBC see me getting g-packs, herringbones mad stones in em
The voice is olive green, three doors Im on bring my goons home
Pumas on, points like unicorns, fuming in uniforms
What you wanna do with me, just sue me homes
Yea Half Mike half Nike, handle got grip
Got monkeys out here ready to flip
We pull a stunt, grab knots, push cops, just for vengeance
For killing that real shit independence
Far glowing like blonde hair, probably be the way we be rolling
Lets cash a check yall bring the broads here
Until the sun burns out, aint nobody eating
We on your block now, Glock up or call the precinct

(Chorus  Method Man & Raekwon)
Who is that up in the building?
Hashtag we still win
Raekwon no relation to chef tho, but still trend
My youngun tell em its them
Wu-Tang is for the children
They bugging, tell em again

Deck performing on the track, call him Jeff Gordon
Im still buzzing this is Hennessey the next morning
The upset talking, Im yes y'allin for cheques
Bossin the set, you acting like my ex calling
Aint that a bitch, not the 5 or the 6
I rock 7 on my back thats Kaepernick
I dazzle like a magic trick, fabulous swordsmen
Sort of like abortion I aint having it
S I ready for action, heavily cashing
We set for whatever, whats happening
Cold like the weather in Aspen, flow everlasting
4, 5, 6, your head is crackin, just a fifth of E&J and a eighth of green
No promethazine but I make them lean
Im running with the real yall chasing dreams
While the crowd go wild for their favorite team

(Chorus x 2  Method Man & Raekwon)
Who is that up in the building?
Hashtag we still win
Raekwon no relation to chef tho, but still trend
My youngun tell em its them
Wu-Tang is for the children
They bugging, tell em again
Wu-Tang is for the children




On the average night, I'm likely to stab a fag with a knife
That's when I'm chilling, imagine when I'm mad what it's like
Damn right it's a disasterous sight
Why you think I've been in prison more than half of my life
My life, wolves, bloods and crips, duckin' the digs
We don't like basketball, but still fuck with the knicks
Dimes, twenties, fifties and bricks
Summer art though, if the bitch need a fix, it's triple the tips
Do whatever it takes, the fakes, I can never relate
Ya'll can chill as long as my cheddar is straight
But if I'm broke, shit, I'mma load the beretta with eight
Show y'all niggas my gun game is better than great
Little crack baby, ignorant son of a black lady
Who never bothered to teach you cause the bitch was that shady
Recognize nigga, we can settle the score
Big Sai', Dutchmaster, we reppin' the raw


"Raw I'mma give it to ya" - U-God
"Down and so raw"
"One thousand grams of uncut to the gut " - Biggie
"Raw I'mma give it to ya" - U-God
"R.A.W."
"Watch us cook this hood shit"


It's war, I want it all, man, nothing's enough
I'm on the chatline doubling up, cousin it's us
Pimpin' out the toy trucks, pumpin' the clutch
Smooth through on the graveshift, dump on you ducks
Above the law, still duckin' the cuffs, still fuck in the truck
I hold you hostage, corrupt with the bust
In the mean streets, stuck in the lust, never trusted in trust
When the pressure's on, perform in the clutch
When my hand deal, call it a flush, think I'm fallin', you nuts
Northern Lights rap, caught with the rush
Burn a big bud, tossing it up, flossin' is up
The raw with the big paw, ballin' with us
See my warface, the project halls is rough
With a satellite phone you couldn't call my bluff
Many runnings with jake, left my jaw to scuff
On some what, paper chasing, from dawn to dusk




Bekay's the reason that your label got a street team
The definition of a street dream, listen to the streets scream
The game made the pain, I'mma bring longer
But I'm like Magic with AIDS, what don't kill you make you stronger
Corny chickens, my dick, whores be licking
Fifty pound loads, to they jaw, they sipping
And anything I'm rhyming on, will spit flames to the roof
Like gonorrhea dick, pissing with a condom on
Had to do these slugs, locked in cutie's butts
Dip my balls in vodka, I'm absolutely nuts
Whose gonna spit, bruise in your clit
If you nice on the mic, I'mma put screws in this bitch
Your big fucking mouth just had a violent start
More kids know my name than Mike Jackson's private parts
Fuck your roster, my click burn labels
Dutchmaster scratch your fuckin' face off with a turntable






When the road is gone, and you can't find no way
So don't you threaten my, my, my friend now
It'll be another day


Black male, jail cell, same hell, murderous prospects
Drain ale, same pale, buck shots, reign hail
Same meal, stepping like robot, pain kill
Trail stream from silk screen to nine mill
Crush my will, cook a meal like rosewoods
I'm coming for them gold goods, precision like dope head
My biscuit toasted, open fine hoes, acid for flat bread
Solicit, catch casket dripping, unbutton hostlers
Embroidered clips in, Chicago Bear puff, quick to snare off
Pick six to carry off his coffin
While I'm often pterodactyl off white widow with horsemen
Back to the Wall Street lawn, heaters and more shit
My literary literally drown your war ship
Send a shell now tear up your style to the corporate
First forty eight hours is never seen, no force could measure me
The hunts off when he endorse my treasury
Yellow apparition, smell a kush and incense
I dwell on benches where the Air Force is scared to going off course
Burn your after murder spree then I'm off to witness
Double dutch and I don't mean the ropes, I'm off the benches
Coughing endless, kill me and spends off a genius intention
Bring the nigga henchmen, spend shells on and on it was expensive



Now there's one thing I should mention, massive pounds of pressure
Nothing can hold me, watch as I levitate gravity
None could match me, cave chest cavity
Basic mathematical flow, like the max spray
Monumental word play, carefully construct the measurements
When you weighin' up, refining to it's higher science
A spill of carbon, one gun shot of diesel
A microphone touch of mission, plan an eruption
Underworld corruption, don't trust him it's sadly to say
You might have to bust him one day, I thought I told you



Broad day bullets over Broadway for more pay
Verbal assault, you bitches rep more then foreplay
All day, this is routine, not a facade
No mirage, no regard, no HBO Entourage
Bloodsport, caught with the force, Star Wars, Skywalker
Offin' your boss, tossin' your broad
And there's no shells, left in the drawer, spit them in raw
Nobodies leaving til we settle the score
Chose the high road, never look down, like if my eyes closed
Mine flows, trying to get mine, before the time goes
Ayatollah mind controller, free of the blindfolds
Survive with 50-47's, the nines blow
Dip don, boss underdog from the rip bomb
Click strong, Melo with the handle like the Knicks on
Clips drawn, ducking the blues, choose a fit form
Big arms, lay down your king, only six pawns


My friend, he's an expert, in ninja
Give this letter to him, he will come
Mmm...
What is this ninja?
I'm not familiar
Is this from him?
Watch out!
This may contain poison, don't touch it




Come on! Yeah... yeah..
Yo, yo


Wu-Tang, we always in the Spot Lite
Get paper, every night is hot night
We stay tight, we just livin' our life
We just livin' our life


I drink till I'm drunk, smoke skunk with my stinkin ass, smell the funk
Eekin out the pours, cum stain, shitty drawers
Pissin' down ya elevators shaft, no class, writin graf' on ya walls
It be us, fuck ya law, nigga, my cause is "because"
No yin to my yang, it's a black thing
Used to be in chains, now we snatch chains
Took the crack game applied it to the rap game, y'all
Pop quiz, now, what artist hits the hardest?
Get down with the syndrome: retarded
I think it was them swordsmen, place ya chess pieces on the boards and
Take it to square, this ain't no Yacub affair
Or a New World Disorder, got us, fuckin the coal miner's daughter
That y'all, but not us
Fly back, flag a cab and say "check ya"
Next time you see me, say peace and I'll respect ya, Tical




Yo, lights, cameras, don't forget the action
The needle skip, but the turntable scratchin'
Chain blow, bangles, heavy on the cashin'
Same old, Range rove', rainbow Manhattan
Craftmen, captive, still I'm avalanchin'
Holy war, handsome, break 'em off harassin'
Latest fashion, passion, bullets reign gashin'
Flippin' through frenzy, the same Wu-Tang
The Hollywood frame, purple haze stain
Rules of dame, fools, choose to bang
Nigga, you lose, Wu, bruise the game
A few men came, that really held weight
Drop, Chinese bars, stars in fifty-two states
Like, bats out of hell, we crash the gates
Without a base, left the gun powder case
Ladies chase, the hip-hop Babyface




Word up, throw your hands in the air, like you just don't care
Wu-Tang in your atmosphere, everybody say "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"


Mic Capone, it's best to avoid my strike zone
I zone and swing a sword that'll slice stone
Nice clone, but you could never match the born master
Who tore back half the world, and still saught after by
Dick ridin' niggas, and chicks who do ditto
Singin' like the Four Tops, providin' info
See me low, through the Jeep window, the chrome spins slow
Gene-ral on the J.O., survival M.O
For now get wild, similar to Ol' Dirty
A third time felon just hit with over thirty
Note worthy style, have them so thirsty
First degree heat, you quittin' on me
Cold turkey, no mercy




Wu-Tang, put you in the Cobra Clutch, til you give up
Ya'll can live up to, Witty Unpredictable
Street mentality, return of the cavalry
36 Chambers, we off key block
Black on the block, tell ya D.J.'s to quit
M.C.'s, to stop that bullshit
Me, Ghost and Rae, we known to pull shit
Step with the brick, on some Ice Water shit
Wallo's in all colors (now) let's get chips, like
Robbin' the bank, pull up with the new whips
Don't get mad, respect rank
No matter how you gettin' dough, give thanks
Everybody hold up your shanks





K
2009!! Geez
Yeah, this be that old school type shit
Yeah, that Blaxploitation shit (Afro picks, Cadillac whips)
We gon' hit you like Truck Turner, with the burner


I'm the Stereotype, in the zone where chrome meet chrome
Hard heads call it home sweet home
I rep that, hat to the back, chrome blaze
Low fade, blazin' the haze in the hallways
Young black nigga, bout to come back bigger
Rap action figure, that's strapped with the spitter
I serve mankind like a super hero
Gonna move the people, with sharp darts to the ear hole
And terror spin, veteran style, ghetto child
Call his name, hear it echo for miles
Check my files, before you get wild, reconcile
Trust, I touch kids, but I'm no pedophile
The Superfly, I, O'Neal, holdin' the steel
With the ounce from the greenhouse bent behind the wheel
What's the deal? Dick riders on board
In this Bloodsport, I'm like Jean Claude, yes, lord


This thing, is gonna be alright (alright) here comes the Stereotype
It takes, time to get it right (that's right) count on the Stereotype


The Stereotype, this life, I'm knee deep in
The creeps keep creepin', the heat streets sweepin'
The greed keeps feedin', the seeds need teachin'
Police be seekin', all the ones free speechin'
Guns be blowin', young g's holdin'
Nerve control 'em, they say that son be zonin'
I'm half Huey, half Malcolm, part Martin
Mixed with Mark Garvey, sharp as Sharpton
A known fact, that I stay pro black
I go back like Kojak or Bobby Womack
Or maybe Jim Brown, been down from Ground Zero
Crowned renowned hero, sound pounds your earlobe
Mean daddy like a '69 green Caddy
Seen daddy soakin' that fox, she beam badly
With more drama than you find in the flicks
I'm Dolemite, without the afro picks, I'm flyin' kicks, it's...




My chain hang loose like I wear my jeans
I got soul like Rakim and Grandma greens
I represent The Projects, everything hood
Big wolves in the woodwork, everything good
In the bright lights, Big City, it's ten times gritty
Doin' life on the streets, whose biddin' wit me?
Regardless, I'mma hold mine down, load my pound
Target on the unknowns who roam my town
There they go on that bullshit, when it go down
You know who the culprit, sure enough
The R-E-B-E, L, yell it freely
I, call him Stereo, T-Y-P-E
Greasy, on the hunt for the big easy
Switch the game like plantin' cracks on the D.T
Say what you say, G, hate don't mistake me
Or play me like a must paid fee, that ain't me






My S.I. swagger, I'm kill'n em the best style faster
The shook and touched by a rapper
They thinking it's just music, Like my Nike Airs I just do it
This here life neck and my wrist blue, It's how fish do it
Chef it to the block, My bitches love hard cock
I stuff a quarter of soft right in their twat
My block, I'm like a soldier with fatigues on strapped
With stripes, Like a General leaving for Iraq
My drive, Be successful leaving and then fly back
Hit the road, Yeah we eating, So pieces dived that
Taylor, I was leaning on corners with my back
Up against the wall, Had no choice but fire back
Now, Benz truck with the tires on the back
They was in the Doge Shadow when my tires had a flat
Ohh, Why you hate Fes, Cause I stay fresh
Young black nigga from the hood and you make less


Been in the streets, Been-Been-Been in the streets
Been-Been-Been in the streets, Shaolin stomp with Timberland feet


Is it the way that my jeans hang over my kicks
When you see me I'll be on the G strolle with my bitch
Skipping towns like I'm owing a grip, Set show em respect
I'm repping alone, I'm home on the strip
Zone with the kids, You feel me cause you know what it is
All you eying from the sideline probing my biz
Hell right now I'm open for biz
And my life style's blowing your wig
How they like wild'n with the kid
Like a nigga fresh home from a bid
Focus on tips, City boy post on the pigs
Focus on his, Supposed to stay close to the ridge
You know anything fucking with a soldier this big
Watch me now son, I'm over the bridge
Type a nigga have his outfit matching with the boat and the crib
Why you talking, Why you open your gibbs
No points for me to open your wig, Nobody know who you is nigga





Both Jonathan Hay albums, The Urban Hitchcock LP and Mountain Biking Through Louisville with DJ Whoo Kid are being released on March 1st. All the lyrics will be added then




You wanna go to war? I'll lyrically smoke you all
Got villains, guerrillas and killers, feelin' demented
Respect this life and protect yah neck, get your necklace swiped
Turn your flesh to ice, it seems like you don't respect your life
The rap game look at me in a respective light
Cause I bless the mic with the bess rappers to ever write
Check the hype, comin' at T isn't the best advice
Slap rappers around, make 'em lose their electrolytes
These new lyric rappers, make 'em fall backwards
Give 'em closed caskets and cold blackness, I'm so ratchet
The flow's magic, reputation is so classic
Got the shows mastered, you rap like you're asthmatic
Animal shit, we're cannibals and killin' you quick
You fuckin' with Term, Inspectah Deck and Chris
Can't forget the Blanc0, he stay strapped cause it's hot out
Where you can get shot up just for givin' a shout out


Word in the hood, homie got popped for stealin' bricks
I'ma rock this shit, caught him sleepin', gave him half a clip
Candles burnin', smell the roses, family took a hit
Took a L, empty cell, nobody snitched
This when the drama popped, boy don't get your mama shot
I know niggas with no limit in and out the box
Niggas who see murder, don't say shit to cops
Niggas who beat murder, self defense and walked
When there's war up in the jungle, niggas carry hawks
Carry 
Split your shit wide open, don't leave a scar
Catch that bitch you pokin' right in the car
Give her the other half that nigga's let off
She cryin', headshot put it to rest it off
Nigga, this the way that the war begins
Hood shit, every night hearin' shots ring


It starts with heartless niggas runnin' their jibs to you
Run in their crib or put one in their wig
Watch you mouth with it, stupid, my whole unit is outfitted
Money over bullshit, cause we about digits
Cash money, I laugh, niggas is past funny
Half a grand, my little mans'll blast for me
Land of the lost, king me, no matter the cost
Say you boss, then you better let your hammer off
Two time felon, yellin', "Who want what?"
When the war begin, in the end, spoils, it's all us
Thirsty minds, over time with the dirty crimes
He threw the safe off the roof like thirty times
Thirty times, that describes how many shots he took
This to life, risk your life on a sloppy look
Look, see they just don't give a fuck
Listen up, for fifty bucks the triggers bust


So call me Nostradamus marchin' with Martin, Marshas, and all the Spartans
 barkin', I leave you niggas on cartons of milk
My artistry's built, foundations 
Partially killed before the ink'll tarnish the quill
Hotter than steel, crush diamonds with my thoughts alone
Titan when it comes to poems, rhymin' 
Comin' home either dead or victorious
Heavenly glorious, trust me I will get the Delorean
Best to historious, kill your mother, bleedin' her corpse again
You're forced to end, Shaolin mark, hit you with a falcon punch
Bruce Lee, I'm looseleaf, infinity is rounded up to me
The only MC on the level of celestial beings
My emblem gleams, dragons out the best of the kings
You're less than a dream, I'm Nightmare on Elm with the fiends
Kruger, I'm the ruler with the hardest attack
Plus I'm lyrical, Biblical, the god of this rap



"Uh..uh..uh..baby!"


"X-Ecutioners" "Ya..ya..y'all know the name"
"Stabbin the track with both hands"
"X-Ecutioners" "Ya..ya..y'all know the name"
"Louder!!"
"X-Ecutioners" "Ya..ya..y'all know the name"
"Stabbin the track with both hands"
"X-Ecutioners" "Ya..ya..y'all know the name"
"You out there?" "Louder!"


This is masterful, classical, material wax, imperial tactics
Black shit I master, traps that collapse backwards
All area access, passes without practice
Hit em, then I'ma shit on em and spit on em, and send faxes
Maximum amount (uh) not the minimal
The oratal rock chop like Florida Seminole
Subliminal raps which make criminals act bitch
Instrumental in creatin the most pinnacle rap shit
Got Toni Braxton lookin women collapsin
My beats get feet to steppin like Fast Actin Tinactin
Dominant X-Men conference like Pac-10
Backslap wack rap actors to get a reaction
My venom rips tennaments up then I'ma wreck shit
Then I'ma flip, administer hits on this next shit
Deejays collect tips from them then hit the exit
At they show the front row, usually gettin hectic
The X shit...


"Ya..ya..y'all know the name" "X-Ecutioners"
"Stabbin the track with both hands.. together"
"The fall.. you out there?" "Louder!"
"X-Ecutioners" "Ya..ya..y'all know the name"
"Stabbin the track with both hands.. together"
"The fall forever gon' win.. you out there?"


Yeah yo, uh-huh, yeah, check it
You wanna get to my level but you don't hustle enough
Any attempts at touchin my stuff and I'm fuckin you up
I'm sick of weak shit winnin, nigga yo' rhymes ain't rockin
The good life is a bitch, seem like everybody cop blockin
The shotclock is runnin out, gunnin out the police
I crack the teeth of any nigga with beef
Masterpiece, X-Ecutioners, naturally
Any problems, come to Los Angeles and ask for me


Yo castastrophe, none can match me, naturally nasty
Manually smash ya faculty
Veral assault and battery
Sparatically blast at the capacity crowd and cause casualties
Street savy, niggas blast me out the Navi'
Groupie chick wish she could have me
XE in back of me, hit like a daquiri
Accurately, ya don't grab me, ya skills still latchkey


"Ya..ya..y'all know the name" "X-Ecutioners"
"Stabbin the track with both hands.. together"
"The fall.. you out there?" "Louder!"
"X-Ecutioners" "Stabbin the track.....the track"
".....with both hands"


I got my man Roc Raida on the slash and cut
Rob Swift where you at son, the "What What"
Sinister make em - now we ready to go
Last but not least, total eclipse (Whatchu don't know?)
I got a question, who can see him? I don't know
But whatever I play, you know that Skillz gon' flow
Shit we mastered the feat, you can't bring us (what)
Y'all could crap if y'all was doin that shit with eight fingers
Come on black, we in the Hall of Fame
Got ya picture in our crib on the Wall of Shame
I expect emcees to wanna murder me (what)
Cuz when we open up and start cuttin, you wish you was in surgery
You see the X? Hardly
Here's some on-offs nigga take yo' ass back to doin parties
You're better off if somebody shoot ya
And change ya name to DJ I-Got-Beat-By-The-X-Ecutioners


"Ya..ya..y'all know the name" "X-Ecutioners"
"Stabbin the track with both hands.. together"
"The fall.. you out there?" "Fifty thou in the stands"
"X-Ecutioners" "Ya..ya..y'all know the name"
"Stabbin the track with both hands.. together"
"The fall.. forever gon' win" "You out there?" "Louder!"
"Y'all know the name"

*Redman's vocal dog barking*




I came in the game, young nigga banging for fame
In the process, staking my claim
And I train like, Leonidas' son, the fire and sun
The blood, sweat & tears, grinding for ones
Nearly died for it, cried for it, hustle and flow
Right from the seed, competing with my love for the dough
The hunger it burns, I wondered and yearned, they tried skipping my turn
This time, muthafuckas gon' learn
About the rap general, Rebel, I stack regular revenue
Globally local mogul, vocally soldier hold you
Dude faking and fronting, you just say that you want it
I'm the next Nike ad, greatness is nothing
Who run it, I'm coming, I can't, won't, don't stop blunted
Til the dough stop coming, til the hoes stop stunting
Label it a rap, case closed, no discussion
I'm back to the block, got the whole spot dumbing

*instrumental break*


I hear plenty barking, got the semi sparking
It's my time, this is it, like I'm Kenny Loggins
Empty cartridge like Hannibal A-Team
Stop me, wake out your day dream
Stay out the way, please, before you have me facing like eighteen
It's gotta be, then let it be, I'm straight in them state greens
I've been through it all, still stuck in the mud
Eating good, living right, still them fuckers a judge
Like a nigga can't get no greats, when I hit, make the bricks go ape
Cuz I spit cocaine
And I'm leaning em, blue coats is beaming 'em, rolling with the team and 'em
But really only few folks are seen with 'em
Ya'll better mark my words, before it's all set and done
I'mma stun ya'll like Spock and Kirk
Honor the rep, UD's, Donnie and Fes
P.C., Fisk, Banga, straight body a set

*instrumental break*


I even the odds, I'm bleeding, I'm scarred
A nickel bag in the trunk, believe I'm involved
I'm on everything, cuz I ain't feeling the job
Your boy Deck's a king, keep it realer than ya'll
Or say keep it true, you watching like the streets'll do
Hip hop is falling apart, Deck, he's the glue
Haters get off me, you sinking my ship
Fixing your lips, yapping like you thinking he slip
I got a million niggas thinking he sick, a million kids
Thinking he rich, a million bitches think he the shit
You think it's a game, laugh when you leaking in pain
Speaking my pain, hater I'm the reason you came




The maker, owner, plus soul controlla
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the clouds my sofa
To supply ya with the fire
Ayatollah




I was chained in the dungeon, banging, busting
Came from nothing but hunger, pains and suffering
Dunked in the cage for pumping, a younging with hopes
Of becoming the boss, running the force
No respect for none of the laws, something because I'm in front of the broads
Some of ya'll be talking, but avoid the confrontation
It's one of them situations that'll be hard to walk away from
Grown man, stone jam, Daniel taming the lion
Broad day, blazing the iron, hallways where they surviving
You gangsta, you lying, you faking, you hiding
I destroy batti boy, you taste it and riding
Made man with close ties to both sides
Known to get it and blow digit, if the ho wide, for sure, right
Broadband, heavy hand, hit you with the contraband
Wanted man, A-Alikes salute me as I walk the land
New nigga, kneel to Zard, or feel the rod, no appealing the charge
Catch a bad hand, watch you dealing the cards
I speak from the heart, you weak from the start
I be sleeping with sharks, you be briefing the NARCs
Give me reason to start, I be eating your heart
I'm a beast with the bar, you be pleading he stop



Still running your mouth, gun in your mouth, why you wanna start shit?
With the hardest known, bad to the bone, fuck shit up regardless
Modern day martyr, larger than your dollar bill
Numerous groups are faded, the die hards holla still
Killa Killa Hill, still build and destroy the track
Deal is the boy is back, ya'll killing the thrill
I deal in the field, walk my talk, talk revealing the real
I do it for the spoken heard, those who feel what I feel
And I won't let up the pressure, til the pipes bust, the mic's dust
Strike up the cash, man, I catch you when my flight touch
And don't play with the king, and don't play in the ring
The body shot's brutal, leave you layed in a sling
Now get your tombstone, before you're moved on
Before your bird get distracted by the blue stone
Son is a beast, come from the east, the mogul keeps it global
Mountain mover, pounds of buddah, serving the streets the soul food
Many'll call, few are chosen, few are hoping, few opposing
Dude was joking til the ruger smoked him, exposed him
It's more than a game, cats who hate rap, calling my name
For that morphine flow, break a needle off in your vein



I was chained in the dungeon, banging, busting
Came from nothing but hunger, pains and suffering
Dunked in the cage for pumping, a younging with hopes
Of becoming the boss, running the force

No respect for none of the laws
Something because I'm in front of the broads
Some of y'all be talking but avoid the confrontation
It's one of them situations that'll be hard to walk away
From grown man, stone jam, Daniel taming the lion

Broad day, blazing the iron, hallways where they surviving
You gangsta, you lying, you faking, you hiding
I destroy batti boy, you taste it and riding

Made man with close ties to both sides
Known to get it and blow digit if the ho wide, for sure, right
Broadband, heavy hand, hit you with the contraband
Wanted man, A-Alikes salute me as I walk the land

New nigga, kneel to Zard or feel the rod, no appealing the charge
Catch a bad hand, watch you dealing the cards
I speak from the heart, you weak from the start

I be sleeping with sharks, you be briefing the NARCs
Give me reason to start, I be eating your heart
I'm a beast with the bar, you be pleading he stop




Still running your mouth, gun in your mouth, why you wanna start shit?
With the hardest known, bad to the bone, fuck shit up regardless
Modern day martyr, larger than your dollar bill
Numerous groups are faded, the die hards holla still
Killa Killa Hill, still build and destroy the track
Deal is the boy is back, ya'll killing the thrill
I deal in the field, walk my talk, talk revealing the real
I do it for the spoken heard, those who feel what I feel
And I won't let up the pressure, til the pipes bust, the mic's dust
Strike up the cash, man, I catch you when my flight touch
And don't play with the king, and don't play in the ring
The body shot's brutal, leave you layed in a sling
Now get your tombstone, before you're moved on
Before your bird get distracted by the blue stone
Son is a beast, come from the east, the mogul keeps it global
Mountain mover, pounds of buddah, serving the streets the soul food
Many'll call, few are chosen, few are hoping, few opposing
Dude was joking til the ruger smoked him, exposed him
It's more than a game, cats who hate rap, calling my name
For that morphine flow, break a needle off in your vein



"Wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned..." --> Rakim
(repeat 2X)
"Wake you up and as I stare in your..." (repeat 2X)

"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
 Remember P, the one you got your whole style from?
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
 Remember me, the one you got your rhyme style from?
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
 Remember P, the one you got your rhyme style from?

"Yo it's the P" *cut and scratched*


Yo, disperse from off this, who the culprits
That claim to be the newest, rappin bullshit
My rhymes, get Ruger endorsements, my song boost
Intertec sales through the ceiling, let's talk with guns
Convo til the po-lice come
Give you a red shirt with the wet hat to match
First max like it's Hamburger Hill for real
It's Red Dawn when the Mobb get it on, my outfit
Stuck on some wild out shit, all about it
We move gambit, through the overcrowded
Forthwith, pull out long fifths, extended clips
Point the nozzle and shift your back disc
Me and the clique-a, sit down and eat dinner
Wake up every mornin write a new banger
That strike harder than your best attempt to sound like P
Or the H-A-V-O-C, nigga

"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
 Remember me, the one you got the technique from?
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
 Remember me, the one you got your freestyle from?
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
 Remember Deck, I told y'all, Protect Ya Neck

"I'm Rebel INS your highness" *cut and scratched*


Fake one, take one, no ultimatum face one
There's no escape from straight from the grain come the great one
My blade swung, decapitate your snake head
Slit your snake tongue make one false maneuver you a mystery
Unsolved, the mob that revolves automatically involved
Musclebound sounds surround commercial thugs
Rock turtledove bowery suits
And purple gloves, me and you can have some fun
Make it a blast, you couldn't take the impact
With steel shoulderpads, blood for blood
Veteran, covered in mud, wounded in the midst of war
Still tradin slugs gettin major love
Way above you newcomers, I come thunderin
With the heat of two summers when I enter the zone
Move mountains with the presence alone before the words
Rip through the microphone, chrome dipped lyrics
Are known to split stone, you private eyes home in
But can't seem to clone

"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
 Remember Pun, the one you bit your whole shit from?
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
 Remember Pun, I snatched away the moon and blew away the sun
"I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned"
 Remember Pun, the one with over a thousand guns

"You start to suffer" *cut and scratched*


Yo, Big Punisher's ready
Prodigy, Deck and me, QB ("Shaolin") and Bronx trilogy
Lyrically hazardous for your wealth, swing on your world's piece
Foil your plans, boil your grams, take a shine
Fold all your hands, spoil your mans, make him mine
Take all you made, call you gay on Hot 97
Drop by your dwellin got the nueve right behind your melon
Ain't no tellin when the bullet's behind the trigger
I do it to live niggas and Pulitzer Prize winners
You wouldn't survive nigga, if I chose you
Froze you from ear to ear, showin your whole vocal
Who told you, you could roll through, my lyrics practically rose you
From the grave, like The Crow's do (*next lyrics overlap Scarface sample*)
I told you a long time ago, don't ever fuck me
Cause if I leave you half dead ("Oahh-kay!" - T.M.) consider yourself
("You wanna play rough? - T.M.) very lucky, very ugly from the face up
Leave you laced up, Joey Crillz, Pros, Cuban Link, Triple Seis, WHAT?

"Soon you start to suffer" --> Rakim *cut and scratched*

"The RZA" *cut and scratched*

"The Inspectah Deck" *cut and scratched*

"Yo it's the P"  *cut and scratched*

"The Punisher's ready"  *cut and scratched*






What y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
This '97
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to '79


I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultraviolet shine blind forensics
I inspect you, through the future see millennium
Killer Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets, Queen Bees ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block


As the world turns, I spread like germ
Bless the globe with the pestilence
The hard-headed never learn
This my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life standing firm
On foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
Transform into the Ghost Rider
A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire
Who got my back in the line of fire holding back?
What? My peoples if you with me, where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
What the blood clot? We smoke pot and blow spots
You want to think twice? I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums


I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
Vocabulary 'Donna talking, tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what? Run for your brother kid
Run for your team and your "six can't rhyme" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme, your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts, paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought
I got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God


The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang


Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape Hell globe spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anaesthesias
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings


March of the wooden soldiers, C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square we stay in gold like Flair
Escape from your dragon's lair
In particular my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat bass lines on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck, I'm ducking five-year probation


War of the masses, the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song


The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none


Yo Yo Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink, you had a Navy green
Salamander fiend, bitches overheard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cork-pop convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese, is that so?
Ceaser needs the greens, it's Earth
Ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz


Aiyo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer, Blue-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor world tranquilizer
Adjust the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening
Guaranteed made 'em jump like Rod Strickland






Weve just received a report that New York City is under attack by swarms of killer bees. Theyve been seen approaching from Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. We urge you to stay in your homes at this time, as we will be bringing you up-to-the-minute information. This just in: Police are reporting that theres a man on top of a skyscraper, ready to jump. Im told that he is possibly Ol Dirty, a member of the Wu-Tang Clan. The police suspect that there could be some connection between this old dirty man, and the killer bees

Check out the avenue, New York, New York the Rotten Apple
We grapple in the streets to stack loot and slip the shackles
I'm currently, servin twenty-nine to life
Duckin the searchlight, no sleep for like the third night
The big life is trife, got the young kids hyped
Cops shoot on sight, heat pipe be blowin through the night
The land where you ain't fam, there's no pity
Similar to Chocolate City, ten times gritty
Hittin hard, liquor's God, niggas plottin on the come off
And come off, quicker than the clothes on the stripper
And slide like she doin up and down the railing
Bitch tailing in the Range with Golden Arms smooth sailin
The clock's tickin, somebody's on the block snitchin
The plot thickens, phones are tapped, cops listen
Too hot for prison, plus too cold to hold my girl
Cause I married this life and she's my whole world

Chorus: 

It's just a sign of the times
Calmly listen - to these lines..
I'm goin out of my mind
Livin - the street life..


Aiyyo, aiyyo
Make me wanna holla way they do my life
My life, is like a carousel one endless night
Where most die for pies, some holdin their chrome
A large percent die for causes not even their own
When the Inspectah Deck be long dead and gone
Long live the INS clone they workin on
Til then, I hold a section, I stand alone no co-defendant
Showin the weapon, this saga had no story endin
It's ghetto heaven, and at the same time hell - shots propel
The one that missed me got Chanel
In the future ruled by computer, I self tutor
The music is the simulator, facin the user
I do it for those who walk the same road
And no regrets do I hold for the path I chose
No sleep since the intro, patrol the windows
I reminisce, with the chalice and my eyes half closed
If I could do it again, I'd probably do it the same
Thought I was through with the game, I'm goin through it again
The hood life, I'm in it to the limit
Couldn't quit it for a digit, die for it cause I live it

Chorus


Yo, been around the world but just can't seem to leave
The state of mind that causes tangled web I weave
Made my home in the heart of it
Move like Seagal, "Hard Target"
Most want no part of it, it's logic
Cutthroat party in the Shark Pit
Cold blooded souls carry bulldogs and oxes, knowledge this
Maintain and remain sane
In the cold world where the rules ain't changed
Still Rebel to society, government be eyein me
They probably watchin me right now as I'm speakin
But all I'm guilty of is teachin you the truth
They got proof, so you know I'll be home before the weekend
The hood life, I'm in it to the limit
In it from the scrimmage, livin it, lovin every minute
And every hour, til the powers that be
Eventually stress me to the death

"Y'all know the science right?"
"Death with the intellect"
"aight.. aight.."
"Represent, I make it hot"
"13th.. chamber.. specialist.. from the Bricks"

Chorus


Street life.. so trife..
Street life.. for life..
Feels like.. feels like..
My paradiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiise..

"Yeah y'all.. uh-huh.." (7X to fade)




Oooh, nananana, no
I will stay true, we will make, we will make it through, I know


It's like every day bullets over broadway, pumping out the hallway
With small change, this is how we live
It's pop city, gritty ditty bop, got the Glock with me
Shots if you not with me, this is what we give


Born by the liquor store, used to hit the store for Mr. George
Where them playas and them pimps trick the whores
Saw the dope tracks, I sold crack, phone taps from Kojak
The old trap, send the fiend through before your home's jacked
Chrome clap, shopping through the gate door, killas can't escape war
Get rich or die trying to make more
Corner store, cop me a four, with the egg and cheese
Hancock and evergreen, stop cop from SMDs
Young me, used to wheelie the block
Mountain bike, Nike Dunks, skunk, Phillies and gwap
I watched the older heads shake those dice, same night
Watch them, pull out the gauge, when he aced out twice
I mean, everybody searching for the same thing, trying to make a name ring
And claim king, the lifestyle the game bring
Sick whips, linens and crocks, thick women in flocks
Or just a cellblock and prisoners pop


People change like seasons do (people change like the weather)
You know I always stay true (stay true, say me)
Though this life ain't promised to you
In the hardest times will make it through




At 16 I hit the Ave with a brick, smashed with the chicks
Dipped fast on them dicks, zip bag full of nicks
I was bad on the strip, deuce deuce in the booth
Blue goose with the troops, fruit juice and a loose
On the roof with the city on watch, got that brown bag of chocolate
From up top, fifty a pop
Since the OGs told me how to get me a knot
Since then it's been impossible to get me to stop
In the PJ's, where the fiends stay leanin' for days
And the V's stay gleam, blades gleaming the raise
Where the G's play, they don't need a reason to blaze
And the D's stay scheamin' to take me to the cage
Cuz I'm living it, deep in this life, and I'mma love it alot
Cuz anytime grim reaper could strike
Another homicide, it's ironic, son got it
Same corner where his father died, hard to hear his momma cry, why




My people, this is for the struggle
It's not for the ballers, it's for the struggle
You know I got you, it's not guaranteed
We gon' ride though, we gon' live, hold your head




Your highness, live from the bricks, one six
Pete Rock bang your head, break the drumsticks
Verbal assault, rhymes rippin through the mix
Specialist, with the smash hits that can flip
Savagely attack this, clash with, accurate aim
Spark the flame, burn this inside the vein
Ride tracks like the Soul Train, hold ya brain
In the state of shock, make em drop, it's a cold game
I bang with the big boys, those who hold name
Amateurs get hung with they own gold chains
I swing blades, best bring grenades against
A Tru Master, way beyond your freshman attempts
Spit rounds on the floor, evidence of the war
It's on til the death til we settle the score
You can never measure, to the standard, of the most
Popular demanded, rap classics
Pop corks while the style knock your socks off
Ghetto summer jam's got the streets blocked off
Plots to knock me off get stopped short
Armed with my thoughts, move the world with an unknown force


Aiyyo, we had the bass pound speakers, shell toed Adidas (uh-huh)
Original rap with new school leaders (true)
Graffiti art names with fat gold chains
Shock the world cousin, while hip-hop remains

"I'm a true master, you can check my credentials" - Jeru
"Master in the MC field" - Parrish Smith
"Master, preacher, poet, a teacher" - O.C
"From the master.. from the master" - Biggie Smalls


Yo I drop jewels like hail, rap rides the third rail
Transmit def styles with sign language in braille
In hot pursuit of Donald Trump rap loot
Produce what you feel with Navy Seal mic troops
Spark the S-P, slaughter, Pete Rock of Gibraltar
Miraculous lyrics that tread water
A rap nigga, show respect, write rhymes that connect
Collaborate, break bread with Kurupt and Deck
Keep my feet blessed, fresh with the Scottie Pippen's
In the game of life, I play all positions
Stop look and listen, total package, yes a true master
Produce rhymes, slang hits faster
The master of the game, solo artist by name
Paint the masterpiece that lies inside the frame
Pass with flying colors, the number one Soul Brother
All eyes on us, guard your grill and take cover

Aiyyo, we had the bass pound speakers, shell toed Adidas (uh-huh)
Original rap with new school leaders (true)
Graffiti art names with fat gold chains
Shock the world cousin, while hip-hop remains

"I'm a true master, you can check my credentials" - Jeru The Damaja
"Master in the MC field" - Parrish Smith
"Master, preacher, poet, a teacher" - O.C
"From the master.. from the master" - Biggie Smalls


I'm the epicenter of this natural disaster
I'm disastrous with smashes, cold and hot flashin
Masters of self, a whole carload of explosives
Like Zorro your host is
Death with the intellect from wizards to warlocks
I'm sore ock, I'm raw ock with four Glocks, smallpox
More ways to get paid, more ways to display
More rhymes to say, more AK's to spray
God is good growin up in the hood
Done some things bad, done some things good
Me and Pete is like rhymes to chemicals, clash
Atom bombs to mustard gas
We intervene, I break ya, take ya to a whole difference scene
AR-15's and beams
Got em jumpin like I swallowed a gang of jumpin beans
Explode and reload, we dumps machines
Radical in war, Kurupt's a mad star
I'm a hard dogg, raw dogg, hog with the gold paw
Dogg Pound Gangstaz -- D.P.G
I'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta -- D.P.G
I'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta -- D.P.G
Inspectah Deck and Kurupt and Pete Rock to drop the beat

"Masters of art" - KRS-One
"Be the sharpest motherfucker
With the beats, with the rhymes" - Method

"Check this out..."




You know the age old saying with dead role playing
Leave an a-hole in the k-hole praying
Newsflash, this is how an emcee sound
I put it down like no look dunks from Dee Brown
We in the house
 two doors down from two Thors now
Evil, Lex Luthor's style, the crew's all wild
The price of death never been cheaper
And you aint gotta notify your next of kin neither
You can't sleep 'cause the inn keeper is the Grim Reaper
I'm a sin eater, Czarface the ringleader
Bust a nine millimeter rhyme at your two-seater
Crush your spine with a lethal line, you're an easy bleeder
I'm a mind reader so I transform the streets off
Wide-eyed looking at bodies like you're complete soft
My pen ain't deadly, depending on how the beats are
It's deadly 'cause I made it explosive, you know how geeks are
Each bar leave a deep scar, we spar
In the East where the beasts are
Catch my metaphors kind of like Bautista
Respect authority, I'm throwing up a police car
Rugged flows, I'm Eleven with the bloody nose
Telekinetic, you rapping telepathatic
I bring stranger things
You'd think a demon was arranging things
Godly king
My change of rings smash my angel wings
I'm a nice guy, but only off the track when I don't rap
You been a dick, no Cumberbatch
If the beat cut the right field like Mookie Betts
I might just hit you like two in the chest


(Yeah, Czarface, face off)
G in the game, youngins dream of being the same
No, you couldn't be me without feeling my pain
Throw up the grind, snake eye, notice the shine
Hit 'em with a quick clip like I'm posting a Vine
Off of the bread, violators, off with their head
Rather walk off to ledge before talking to Feds
Working your brain, fast life, merging my lane
How I crush up the base like I'm serving 'em 'caine
Hate if you will, I still get 'em papers and chill
Baggy jeans sag really, thats the weight of the bills
Swim with the shark, boy, you getting lit from the start
Saying life's like a movie and I'm living the part
Deck is a Beast, naturally they envy me
Limitless lines, you swear that Im on NZT
Dude is a vet, INS schooling the best
Lose your breath when I hit you like two in the chest
Hit you like two in the chest, hit you like two in the chest




Round up, round up, round up, round up
Round up, round up, round up, round up...


No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now


The greatest B-Boy of all time, started from small crimes
While others had big tops I was slingin' small dimes
Tryin' to make the come up, the blow used to numb up
A few G's a week, my clique used to sum up
Till my brother got locked up, my girl got knocked up
My closest homies each, got popped up and shot up
And cops flood the block, no way to eat
So I dropped a half a G on a rented SP
1200 Sampler, and a Yamaha Four-Track
The bass from the lab used to blow the fuckin' door back
While Ghost was doin' stick-ups, tryin' to make a vic' up
Waitin' outside for the Brinks truck to pick up
Nothing would work, so we're back to choppin' nicks up
Givin' grown ass women two vials for a dick suck
When I was stressed I would head to the rest
Then the pads on the SP-12 got pressed
Makin' beats for the streets, so the family could eat
In '93, Wu-Tang Clan dropped their first LP
We went platinum, *whoo-peesh*, yeah we flatten 'em
Pockets got fat and um, went and got Cap and 'em
Staten's on the map and um, Brooklyn Zu is bombin' 'em
All around the world, Killa Beez start swarmin' 'em
You can't stop us, you can't block us
Rock us or mock us, knock us or top us
Better sit back and watch us...




Can't stop me man...
No matter how hard, you better go hard
So hard, if you gonna try and stop me now
I be ruckus to rhythm like the blocks be wild
Bad enough I got the cops tryin' to lock me down
Can't nobody break my stride or shake my pride
Without a homicide, case and trial
It's a long time comin', long nines bustin'
Cradle to the grave I be on my grind hustlin'
Sometimes when I think about it, have my mind buggin'
The shit that I been through, things that I've seen
The chicks that I ran through, places I've been
I'm a victim of the very song I sing
That's how it is in the heart of it, most want no part of it
Some will soothe the pain through booze and narcotics
I'mma hold my head, stay true to where my heart is
Either you pay with your life, or you pay dues and homage





*eerie winds blow*
*winds die down as beat drops*


It had to be this way
This is for real
Nobody said it would be easy
So let it be (ooh.. oh yeah)

Aiyyo, S.I.N.Y., Killa Bee hive
Eastside, duckin' the 5, roll wit' the live
Sweet Love, sweep me in the bug eye, we 'bout to glide
Head fried, spittin' the scribe, move in disguise
Wan' test I? Access denied
I live and die by the motto: let none survive
Livin' off my last cut, can't hold the sword up
You can have that for free before I take your best offer
Stalker, preparin' for your sayanora
Torture, test my waters I come like orca
Niggas need life supporters, for bein' so weak
I speak as a veteran and lace the heads I've creased
And live my footprints wherever I've blessed my presence
I.N.S., livin' legend 'til the essence
Givin' with no prescription, this is the medicine
Settin' a new standard, they fail measurin' up to
They suck too, thorns in the hustle
Pawns in the struggle, darts fly like C.I.s beyond the jungle
Trouble Man can't dance the Hollywood Shuffle
Knees buckle when the Killa Bees come thru
All you heard was "1, 2", then the gun blew
Question is, "From who?", numb you
Like a 100 CC's of morphine and daily
Keep out of reach of your offsprings


Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
You pumpin' that Substance, that's Uncontrolled
*repeat 2x*


Too cold to hold, Substance -- Uncontrolled
Five-O said, "Tell it to the judge", I never told
Never fold, know some turn like fake gold
Young and old I look down like parole holds
In the midst where the clips blow, I rip shows
Hit your zip code, my sick flow condones
Soon to spread like Ebola, the autopsy showed
The reports, another Jon Doe -- overdoser
Overexposure, facin' the flame thrower
I hold you hostage, the code name's the Iyatollah
Mind controller, 2009 time quota
The high roller, sting like a King Cobra
Blow the whistle on kids who unofficial
Pistol pops, ceremony deep within the gristle
Nickel and dime, rhymes sign of the times
My life line, bubble like a fine wine, dyin' for mines
The dopeman, deliver like the postman
Patrol man, saw the hand-to-hand, did I run?
They know I got the teens strung, plus the fiends come
In abundance, lined up, spendin' 100's
The Substance provides, continuous high
I'll give you one free for every 5 sides you buy
Gettin' high off my own supply, low in the ride
With the low eye, daybreak and makin' dough rise




My style's so underground, I write rhymes on fossils
Use as directed and wear protective goggles
Shaolin's the borough, rap Picasso
Blow like a hollow-point, foes sure to follow
Pop a bottle forever, can't stop tommorow
Chewin' all food for thought, hard to swallow
Cold like Chicago winds, taps on my convo
El Diablo cross the Verazanno
P.L.O. Style, released while the beasts raid
And those who can't stand the heat, they seek shade
The rapture was told of how one man tackled the globe
We go so deep, it rattles your soul
I see many have come, but few are chose for the role
In this ritual, rhymes walkin' on hot coals
Quick to spot those who pose as friends and foes
Wind up violated like I was the P-O


Satisfaction or your money back
Gotta keep to makin' comebacks
It's the best that you ever had
Got you fiendin' on the next bag



Uncontrolled...




Plush whips and rollies, ice chains and stogies
No bitch could hold me, in this Thug World


I hold it with the bolo grip, solo control the strip
Behold, P.L.O. the click, man, it's over with
So quick, notice how we bang with the knuckles bare
Wu-Tang, keep it fresh like tupper ware
The Jungle, Animal House, gat in your mouth
Polly with the wild life, cannibal out
Give this five course meal in effect, reel to reel or cassette
Or with the mask on, peelin' the tech
Killah Hill, man, you feelin' my set, feelin' my rep
And I'm met, with the top down, wheelin' the 'Vette
Scoop me downtown, cop the brown and back to the bids
Twist a blunt in front of Jake and still mash on the strip
Face sick with the rap shit, stacking them chips
In the pits, stick shit, cats packing them grips
Bad bitch with the black six, after my dick
She like, 'this your pussy,' then she splashed my clique
Not a fake, not a fraud, see my name on the wall
Niggas straight, like an inmate, try'nna make the board
Snake waiting, dudes came for sure, I lay law
Stay raw, cause a 'massacre' with no 'chainsaw'
Half y'all talk about it, but you don't want war
See my wolves eat the bones and we still want more
We be foaming at the mouth, even, I doubt we leave without eating
So without reason, pounds are squeezing
The lifestyle of fiends and beans, big dreams and CREAM
Bitches ride like the Scream Machine
For a taste of it, the chicks strip, clean out the jeans
Next thing she was smuggling coke between the seams

 + (RZA)
If real niggas is listening, the life we living in, is wrong
(Witty Wu-Tang is unpredictable, Witty Wu-Tang is unpredictable)
Back for transitions, to save us from harm
We in the race for time... so we won't lose our mind
But if we run the race like a thug
We would lose that mind that we made of


You kept the weapon concealed like a magician's secret dollar bill
Liable to pull a knife from out of his heel
Snatch the sword from the rock with one hand
One finger, bzzz, turn ya body to sand
You'll be hoping you'd be Spidey, to get away from this
You be hoping you be whitey when the judge get pissed
One man, can't uplift the land
Like Method Man standing on the hands of fans
See the Captain and Lieutenants, true descendant
Splendid, unprecedented, hip hop vintage
Started from the park benches, before the NARCs could snitch us
He was God Cypher Divine, trying to spark the wizards






Been a long journey, they always told me ''don't worry''
Been through so much the ways of the world don't concern me
I rise above it, can't front, sometimes I love it
Then I realized so many lives died for nothing
Picture me tricking, this is blood money, brothers was slain
Cause of the game mothers suffered the pain
Even though there was nothing to gain
We got our life on the line, everybody wants something to claim
Life struggle, all we search for is the right hustle
Fight the bubble and flex if tight muscle
And all you ask for is the one you'd like to love you
And if you say you ride, just know that I can trust you
Whole hearted cause it's so cold hearted
They are zombies, all of their souls have departed
Through the good, bad, the ugly I'm Eastwood
Trying to eat good so I can sleep good


When my seeds grow old and I'm weak and gray
That's a job well done so in peace I lay
Until that day comes I'mma lead the way
Won't be a stray until I see the day
When I leave the streets and earn a decent pay
When I'm feeling that peace I put the piece away
Until that day comes I'mma lead the way
Won't be a stray until I see the day


My travels acquiring knowledge, grab a handful
Shaking the dice, living life on the gamble
I won't slow up on the daily getting dough up
I probably won't live to see my reward, fuck it, so what?
I can't complain, well can he stand the rain?
Yeah, I'm sure the storm surely get a man to change
There's a lesson in everything, the best go through it
If you ready for anything let's go do it
I wanna see my niggas free out the cage
Or get blazed off of diesel and haze
They'll be amazed on how things changed
Should the youth take the blame? Time marches on
Still nothing stays the same, I'm so focused
Grabbing hold to every moment
Getting my stance, this is the chance, don't blow it
Fake none, this is what you waited for from day one
Make no mistake, son, I pray when the day come






Yeah, yeah, this how it go down nigga
Urban Icons, they got my nigga JoJo Pellegrino
In the place to be, like Run-DMC, nigga
Uh huh, Rebel INS, come on, come on, S.I., S.I
(Yo, check it out, yo, eyo) Shaolin!


How dare you insult my intelligence
And question my lyrical excellence
I should break your neck for this negligence
Public display of ignorance
Yo, matter fact the next rapper attemptin' to beats
Gettin' jammed in his ass with a jagged broom stick til his finder rips
I'm me at my best, you, just you with your worst
So naturally you at your best, couldn't fuck with me at my worst
A hungry MC willin' to blow at any cost
One day I smoke the hydro and battle myself in the mirror
And loss, burn you like vanilla Dutches, twisted like blunt wraps
Take kids to school like yellow buses give 'em dunce caps
Yo, step into me, get it poppin' like a western movie
Witty punchlines is how I get 'em usually
Wu harder then a bore, show your barber, some get lost
Seen your flick in the Step Ya Rap Game Up column in the Source
Effortlessly I smash rappers, platinum artist to napsackers
Tell 'em turn around and spit, this shit is assed backwards


Yeah, this shit is assed backwards
(Get out of here with your wack ass rhymes, nigga)
This shit is assed backwards 
(Break it off, you and your notebook, punk!) Eyo, eyo, yo


I spit heat and watch all you perspire
Fuck you, my balls is twisted, I air you out like drawers in the dryer
And your wifey piece, I'm all up inside her
Yo, you's about to get burnt
Fresh out the gates of hell I brought you some fire
Hella flip flows to fifth pros off and gets hot
While Pelle' grip hoes like a pit bull's jaw when it's locked
Run for cover when them large guns clap, and wanna flat
With a slug up in your Von Dutch cap, JJP!
Ain't no beefin' with him to this beat to your chin
And have you speakin' Chinese like Jin
Get to cuttin' like Funk Flex scratchin' the classics
And leave 'em patched up, like Jeff Hamilton jackets
Once you gettin' wrapped in the rug, clapped in your mug
Spun around and left face down to drown in your blood
Joey Fazools, pop tools, handle the snub
And my wrists all nuggity like Canada Bud
Crip is weak, grips the lugar, compliments to the mafia
And I don't mean the Three 6 or Junior
Platinum scan 'till I'm set with this
I'm sorry dad, but raps my ambition, so fuck a 401K plan and benefits
Yo Sonny brought the AK man with extra clips (Yeah)
Your button make you a brave man, your meant to picks (Yeah!)
Snitch, dissin' Joe's like pitchin' in the winters
Half time, when the whistle blows it's the beginning to your end
Riches I spend, bitches I bend, you fake pimps pretend
I fuck around a friend, you fuck a Rhonda friend
And ain't nothin' your shorty wouldn't let me do
The way they use a Don Juan, the chicks don't want nothin' to do with you
Caked up like make-up, on Anna Nicole Smith grill
You holdin' out the blade and leave your mug with a fish gill
I'm what the fans need, the birds want, and the Bricks feel
They thought I was the shit then, they think I'm the shit still, Clippers




There comes a time when you'll be stripped of your stripes
Take away the accolades, and look yourself in the face, you know
No lactose, just a reality dose
We keep it true, yeah, yo


You wanna be large, you wanna be hard
You wanna be God, you're not quite
You wanna be thugs, you wanna be Bloods
You wanna be loved, is that right?
You wanna be friends, you wanna be him
You wanna be them, you act like
You wanna be live, you wanna be fly
You wanna be high, I gotta be me


Born July 6th, 3:23
With a finger for the world up in front of me
Had the gall, had a ball, but ain't have shit
Played the hall, played some ball, average black kid
With a passion to live and see the lands
Without sacrificin' my soul or meet demands
I strive for what I live for, me and my Clan
And searched for provocative plans to feed the Fam
This is no act or mirage, never rocked a corsage
Spanned the globe on roam, nobody God
See everybody's a thug, everybody sold drugs
Everybody rocked an ice cold mug
Most killas I know, is either six feet below
Or lost in the system, doin' years in the hole
It's the changin' of the God, witness the move
But your feet not big enough to fit in my shoes, nigga




Far from the inventor, like Notorious said
But I'm quick to pull my sword and it's off with your head
I never was a dick rider, you never see me try to
Be like that dude, soft, plus, he wack too
Put the money on wood, make it all good
Then make arrangements, I'm bringin' my hood
Pushin' four wheel motion with the sounds and tints
In suspense, ya'll snake eyes bounce off the tents
See, they rent cars and jewels to fool you
In the video, actin' like, that's how they really flow
But only a low percentage know
Only five every hundred make dough, they say so
Oh, you got a rollie plus a six point o
But no, you're not authentic, you're just for show
Lookin' for the next free ride to latch on
In the short amount of time, watch the world catch on that




And that's who I be
Money back guarantee, if it's not quality
This here's official, if not, I wouldn't hit you
I gotta be true, I take offense to the issue
Not your typical rituals I chant
Givin' the chance, watch it rain like an Indian dance
State it like Abe, at Gettysburg, bet he's heard
Through galaxies, aliens stuck on every word
Livin' legend, veteran known to set trend
Flex powers on the mic, like the X-Men
Destined to hit the hall of fame, quick
But ya'll kick the same lame shit
Kick 'em in the groin, for playin' both sides of the coin
Now who will be the next click you join
I stand on my own two feet, truly unique
That's the difference between you and me, you wanna be






Yo.. yeah
Don't erase none of that good shit in the beginnin
Yo.. spill drinks on ya, get stank on ya
Yo.. yo.. pinky ring shit, yo
That pinky ring shit, yo


It's that pinky ring shit, the legend of masked kid
Shoot out the speakers when my guns get jurassic
Superbad, who am I? Dolemite classic
The vandal's back, hands on Angela Bassett
I handle my plastic, gunplay I mastered
No coke, dope mixed down with acid on record
Broken down and crafted in seconds
Lady's choice, the golden voice still peppered
Better, respect it, bitch believe
I pull rabbits out the hat, tricks up my sleeves
I air out the showroom, the shit can breathe
Fix your weave, behold my expertise


I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back
I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back


Take it back to the peoples, leanin' gettin' rec room punch
We in them authentic alley switchin joints
Major general niggas, five stars
Both arms rock when coke dropped we read a hundred niggas palms
Silencers, garbage bags of hash
For every cop we paid retired now the nigga on smash
Gash you out your burner fast
You swing down hatin me now respect get your fingers off the glass




Yo what the fuck yo?! Yo what the fuck y'all comin for?
Get the fuck away from my door!
We got big guns in here, coke over there
With blue bag and E pills stashed under the chair
And there's Boss Hog black and white pit with the pink lips
Stan thought he was soft 'til he bit his fingers
The shit had me dyin yo, big fat nigga bleedin
Big cat nigga all season
On the beach truck, stuck with Hawaiian ice
Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought FUBU
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
18 karat rap between noodles




Up at Killa Bee headquarters, four whips just pulled up
I saw Johnny sippin Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin off the hip
I sit took three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead king, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ".. Any Means Necessary"


John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all get shot


New York, New York, legendary rhyme boss
Code name Charlie Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
You crash-tests can't measure the threat
I dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah
Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin, feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself
The Noble, Sir I mass mogul
Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals


This is grown man talkin, coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect father Eton with Addies
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see


From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets









Yeah, back from the dead
It's the Rebel, I Soldier, I told ya
I shall return, yeah


Ya'll done fucked up, lettin' me live, something's got to give
I'm positive, you're gonna all pay homage
Believe me, I ain't lyin' down that easy
And that thought applies for those who proud to see me
Through the distraction, I was wounded in action
An act of betrayal, but I knew the assassin
Now I pack a vengeance like Steven Seagal
I'm back from the trenches to even the odds and...


You hear the rockets red glare? The bombs burstin' in air?
Gave proof through the night, that I stood through the fight
Yeah, the Rebel's still here, what?


Ya'll better rock ya'll hoodies
And hold your girl tight, before we pop that pussy
It be so real, I don't need no deal
My mass appeal make a marvel out how he so ill
Ya'll time is up, try your luck, ya'll wind up
Fucked up, before you even recognize I struck
Roll with the live dozen, got all eyes buzzin'
With strong rhymes cousin, been a long time comin'
Break your weak links, in the chain, fuck your mink, and your reign
Son is lame, plus he thinks it's a game
But, we about to apply the heat (the heat)
And snatch him up out the driver's seat
I put my life on it, post up like who want it
Blast off with the force to send ya'll in orbit
Wild like whitey's in the mosh pit, yeah we gon' start shit
Pack 'em down, then corner the market


To all my real M.C.'s, the ones without a deal M.C.'s
The ones who kick the real life music
Let's link, them niggas can't move no more units


For life I'll be underground, their first thought
Was yo, "How did he survive with no commercial support?"
Damn right, I miss the corporate politics and tricks
Where the SoundScan is rigged and contracts are fixed
I sit in the pit where the grime exist
Legendary, they still lovin' my rhymes from 9-6
Now I'm back, that's my word as I reveal this shit
By choice or by force, ya'll gonna feel this shit, ya hear?


Yo, this is all out war, I'm callin' on all outlaws
Son, they new to the art, ain't true to the heart
Who's down for the cause, huh?




"Phantasm, I'm about to flip"
"Every time I speak shit, I freak shit"
"Phantasm, I'm about to flip"
"Every time I speak shit, I freak shit"


It's funny how we forget ya bastards
Ain't mastered it yet
CD's, we out lasted ya set
Recline my seat
Dwellas, time to shine and eat
In '99 y'all can't compete
Loud Records, yeah we run the streets
With Wu, Big Pun and Infamous
Pete Rock and Dwellas son get into this
Ever since a teen
I've been plotting for cream
Ain't nothing stopping my dream of us locking the scene
But yeah, finally we capitalizing off the rhyming
It's surprising how we rising, reaching new horizons
Analyzing, masterminding, combining
With the best
Enterprising, still shining and climbing, fuck the rest
Trying hard to maintain this
While you get it up the anus like Greg Louganis
Talking 'bout you rich and famous
I keep the stainless steel and one shot, one kill
And don't mistake sales kid for skills for real


"Rough neck, Inspectah Deck's on the set"
"Yeah"
"Rough neck, Inspectah Deck's on the set"
"The maker, owner, plus soul controller"


Yo
I rock for block niggas
Young bucks and brolic bitches
Politicking with the globe in exchange to cop riches
Dynamic vocal
Span global, ran locals off the avenue
You brand new cats can never handle
The one man brigade known to raid the airwaves
Write rhymes with survival knives, bleed in the page
The rap attack is like Mr. Magic
With tragic results
Electrifying, imagine the volts
Burn tracks like Pirellis
This unchained melody trapped inside your memory
May cause a felony
The antidote for the wack quotes you blow
Rap pro holding too much weight to overthrow


"I freak the ill shit"
"U.G."
"Scientist pack appliances"
"I freak the ill shit"
"U.G."
"Hit, smash, by the half"


Yo, yo
Verbal slaughter
Rap skills kill like Orca
Quick to off ya then float off like flying saucers
My rhyme torches, leaving cats begging for life
Third legging your wife
Sharp like the nails that punctured the palms of Christ
When I write rhymes
I slice lines that leave your dome froze like white lines
Shorten your life sign
Son I strikes spines, crack your vertebrae
I'll murder you then run around showing the tape
Like O Dog did in Menace
Rap chemist
Smacking this
Never slacking this
Slap the shit out of rap niggas
For playing a role
Don't give a fuck if you platinum or gold


"Word up man, y'all motherfuckers really don't know what this hip hop's all about" - DJ Premier


Yes yes y'all
I hit ya like a wrecking ball
Stepping tall, weapon all hood
Supplying the goods like cartels in Spain
While the autopsy shows hemorrhage to your brain
Stand in close range I leave ya ear drums in flame
Thoughts lightening up the charts with sharp shooter aim
This Uncontrolled Substance can't be contained
With the blood of battle, I remain stained


Diabiase
Skate for eight more lines to kill
Shines the thrill
Drop rhymes at will
Collect hella respect, it's Dwellas and Deck
Keep ya fellas in check
Cause they don't pose a threat
You best control your set
Told you ya whole crew will get ran through
When we stamp through like the Manchu
Stay strapped like bamboo
For those who oppose, .38 snub nose tucked in 40 below


Yeah, fuck what Willies wear
Rap's wild like hands in Billy Bear
In 48 Hours, verbal showers, get your rain gear
I reign here
You niggas be soft like rein deer
Ain't nothing but pain here
Fucking with me, you sucker MC
Like Run and them
Put a gun to them
Punish men, stumbling off gin
Often get lost in my own zone
Split ya chromosomes, bones hard like stone from ancient Rome


"Ya violating, straight up and down. Man, I'm sick of this shit. Underground will live forever baby." - DJ Premier




Apocalypse Now, mind over matter
Next batter be Tical, put it on a platter
How much uncut raw shit we dealing with?
Murder track what? Slang killing it, touched
You feeling it in your bloodstream
Deadly Venomous elixir hammer like Sledge that be Sister
All In Together Now, follow me the Mister
Mef Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh
Death come in the scripture, 2001
Bring the rap Armageddeon, let it be known
When you walk up in this Dead Zone, with all that wack shit
Now you know you dead wrong, one thousand lashes


Detonate that, pussy Massengil rap cleanse that
The kids rank, snatch collars off while riding off
Float boat big boys, Oakland A's stashed away blades
Ventilation let the sharks Animaze
Something shiest like seven butcher knives
Rolling Rover style twice, finger itchy like lice, hair fell out
Something to conquer, stomp ya like that cat Blanka
Toy Tonka truck, ten carat on ya monster
Ring rocky like fuck switch sides like water rides
The DAT bubble life preserve the other guys
Now fuck y'all act wilder
The style wilder than a praying mantis, chilling like
(long inhale)


As my brothers and I reign rebellious, changing
The courses of time, devils no longer exist
As God Cipher Divine, all minds one, no question
Now check it
Perhaps we can go through Lessons
Or might shot me a pussy protesting
Coming with that lip professing, you must take Allah for fool
Where's his Jewel? Was he using Mathematics as a tool?
Tell me, the struggle is God and I came to build
Shit is so real, inside you distilled
Back in the form of mist, you wishing you did the Knowledge
Before speaking, seeking, where you went wrong
And why would I bring you such physical harm?


Mind arson, my squadron surround the SoundGarden
Guns for hire plus you under fire and a target
Sniper in the cypher, I Pied Piper
Move the housing by the thousand, I watched out the Chrysler
Bombs strike ya like the Mighty Thor, blast the door
Recite a page like a tidal wave crash the shore
Two pulls, I'm wild like mechanical bulls
Pack a full house, it's girls night out, pull a handful
Heavenly laced, stimulation make it feel slow paced
I motivate and await my sober state


Magnificent, heavenly the God stay bent
Five Percent, Range whipping, Soul Controller of the lynch
Macking phone rings, Stephen King drama down at Danzine
My mood swings, suplexed off the rope, magazine
Coconut juice, walnut colored shoe, ninth annual
Moses lost his sandal hiding the manual
Blowing evangel bugging off of Bon Jovi hits
Grandma Lowvey, famous murder weapon was a trophy
Seeds posing in Osh Kosh, guzzle Grolsch
Sabotage massage rap bandit at large
Wolverine Carnation Milk, Wu denim jeans
Thurston Howell the Third, kid's back on the scene
Call it chopped meat cause every word is choppy
Malachi crunch all crows to death, Kobayashi couldn't stop me
Getting caught up in my world, Hagen-Dazs swirl
Back flip and then a twirl, cave your whole world in




Shit is serious, all my life this shit is serious
We got mouths to feed, we got families and babies dependin' on us
We ain't layin' down for this shit, we gon' stand up right now
Yo, yo


When I wake up in the morning
I'm thankful just to wake up in the morning, not layin' in the coffin
Did time and crime, now I write these rhymes
And I die for what's rightfully mine
Most my niggas is gone, I'm fightin on
Like how did I survive this long?
So I plant these seeds, please believe
They'll salute me the moment I leave
Big city of dream, quick pretty machine
In the mud fight, where we get gritty to gleam
Where the thug types bust life, then jiggy for CREAM
Cops storm around the block tryin' to get me in greens
I'm a loose cannon, incredible with Bruce Banner
Lickin' off through your speaker like Snipes with two hammers
Rude manners, bad attitude and grammar
Been through the slammer, got my trees through Miranda
Midnight marauder, want it all nothin' shorter
Hundred dollar big faced bills, now what's your offer?
Forcin' my hand, I bump you off where you stand
Yo, money with the fake fronts, talk to your man
I'm from the land where the hoods roam, and chrome gets tossed
And the rats snatch the throwback off your dead corpse
You could be a gangsta, you could still get caught
And, it be your main man sendin' you off
That's why I wake up in the morning with a six shooter
Ain't slept all mornin' waitin' on the intruder
It's you or I, it's do or die to get in
In the real world, your grandmom's door gets kicked in
I do what it takes to survive, seen the greatest alive
Go from glory, through the snakes and lies
I seen, a honest man when the stakes got high
Grab a gun and take lives over cakes and pies
Gettin', CREAM, cheese or bread, however said
All your dope stash won't match the price on your head
Cause shots flyin' out a blazin' pace
Made ya name save a place, daily in the paper chase
So I wake up in the mornin'
Blessed that I made it to the morning, but the streets still callin'
Yeah, pumpin' my jams or, runnin' a scam
Either way I'm gettin' ones in my hand
I'm one felony short from doin' life
Duel mic make me loose it tonight



* samples were not cleared for the official album release


Y'know? General, general! Word out...
Yeah...
Aiyyo man.. you poppin fuckers
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


It's just rules with beats - you clown niggas can't rule the streets
We set shop! Wu-Tang, we rule the East
Taking over the block!
"From the gate now!"
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
Aiyyo, it's just rules with beats - you clown niggas can't rule the streets
We set shop! Wu-Tang, we rule the East
Taking over the block, you can't fuck with the block!
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Aiyyo, I stay funky and piley, blue Excelero
They lookin for me, what the fuck you behind me for?
Stressing everything I breathe on
I'm from the boulevard where niggas get jacked and peed on
Whatever homey, we more lavish
I might sneak you in the crib, see my lasers and glasses
Try to get my come up on
Yo, and when you see me, you know I got my "come up" arm on
Cartier called me up, robbery here
We got your seed in the back of the Beemer starving
We like lion killers, catch me on stage with the gauge
In my right hand, grenade and this leather bomber
I scout money, you know we hungry and talk funny
Coughing out corner rappers, don't never walk up on me
I write with only insane Malkovich
My troops gave me money to clown with them, fuck it
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


My first gun was a .32, back before uh!
Graduated to the .38, maybe a nine
I prefer the fo' five, stay alive
Techs held the crack gank in '88
8 oz. straight from Florida, the best temp
Camouflage vest, repping the set
Wu on the east wing, twenty-ten, sexy bad
We up at Spain with that thing thing, my crew strong
We take no search for your party dunn, you know how I run
Spray places, cover faces, beat cases
A big mouth will get your teeth knocked the fuck out
Keep a nunchuk, take money, stay ninja
I injure, any motherfuckin contender
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Hey bitch, your time's up! Go finish them rhymes up
All my soldiers is lined up, my corners is crimed up
Niggas know where to find us, settin the grind up
Police checkin them pies up, my rims are shined up
Wu! We on the rise up, crops supplied up
Plottin niggas demise up, boxed in conduct
Scratch we got 'em sized up, and when the East is in the house
You, you, you, you, you...
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


On the side of the projects, grey skully, bubble 'Lo goose
Mac 11 tucked in front of the belly
Prestigious moves, we killin 'em, hoes we drillin 'em
We like George Foreman out in the streets, we grillin 'em
In the van, .45's and dilly's, ready to slam it
House arrest box is goin off, Tony got grams
Gotta bath tub full of white, lay in it like Sam Montana
Tune 'em out, to blow out, chop 'em like fans
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


This is boulevard hard, lounging in your black car
Camouflage rat guard on "Stomp the Yard"
I-N-S spit monster bars, flip long regards
My click dons bitch, y'all are frauds
I get it in like Tim off the glass
Slamming my name, I'm like the prez, sending men off to blast
What I spit, make 'em spend all their cash
I'm so Wu, so new that I ain't ripped off the tags
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


RZA done birthed us, some curse on purpose
I'm the grouch, my mouth is a circus
Burner plus a good learner, don't need a hood
All I need's a good burner, Nat Turner
Snake rat murderer, all I hear is turf talk
Rack rooms full of goons with bullet wound birthmarks
From the first spark, you heard my response
(Wu-Tang!) More results talkin 'bout whole crew's mission just lost
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Out the beehive, you dip and you dive
But you still can't survive, you can't see past five
Check the outlook, this is not in the book
You bein dragged across the floor while your 'dro in my hook
Lyrical joust, found all the deal off the books
Steve Rif gave the nod to Universal, good look
Still spit poison venom, Red Monkey and Wu dem
Have any dudes seen the condos? It's all 'em
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)


Put my +clan in da front+, +reunite+ 'em
Make 'em all R.S.V.P., if they want it, we don't invite 'em
No beef, less talk and more action
We parole as a whole, we'll send you back in fractions
Break through fanatic, low crates deep in attics
The Abbott pulled out a .45, looped with static
I scrolled through the menu then rolled to the venue
The dress code is armor all, put a hole up in him
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)



"Are you ready?"


You know how we get down, we gets down
Whenever we come round, it goes down
You know how we get down, we gets down
Whenever we come round, it goes down


House Gang Undadog, do it for pay
Would tell you kill the rumors, but it's true what they say
Yo, what they say? He be popping like he using the K
UDz, Urban I, another usual day
You can see me on G street, twirling the kush
Prime time, nigga roll with the circle of crooks
Break bread with my G's, they be serving it good
What's the time, what's the reason, what's the word in the hood
I be moving so you know I got a ear to the block
Heard a voice then all that I could hear was the shots
Killa Hill, the badlands, we are the cops
Where you get popped just when you nearing the top
INS, I been there, lived there and done it
Still grind, know I comb through the city for hundreds
Still shine, though the kid stay gritty and love it
He ain't that nigga, you can get it for nothing, hey




S.I.N.Y., crossing the water
See Stoney got that headcrack, four and a quarter
Big unit, pitching this corner to corner
Getting gwap see my daughter gross more than Kimora
Two stepping to the thief theme, real with this thing
True heads represent cuz they feeling the king
Pop a bottle, daddy start doing his thing
While the goons in the bathroom stealing your bling
Man, don't take it personal, it's only the business
All or nothing, INS, know me to get it
Oak dash, stone driveway, linoleum kitchen
Big plasma with the game on, roll with my slippers
The shit that I'm on, they ain't market it yet
Sick maid with the swift blade honor my rep
New Jack City Nino, nigga, growing up fast
Get tossed off the fourth floor right in the trash, yeah






Pop in peace..
Once again I gotta rise from the dead
Like the prophecy has been fulfilled or something
So be it..


I know the code, I'm a capital G., still surviving lowkey
Brain shifting, pitching out of the V
Bottom line, you got a problem with me, my name pop in the P's
Fuck a watch, I got property deeds
I don't talk, won't spot me with D's
You can spot me at the spot, with the next top model from Queens
East side six rider, won't stop at the freeze
Where them, coppers'll squeeze and them boppers is G's
Where it's regular to serve the curb, when I splurge the word
Now break bread, break birds in thirds
Whose y'all I never heard y'all herbs, never burnt ya herb
I run circles, all you work y'all nerves
I'm a legend watch me work my swerve, on the verge to surge
You understand it, if you learn the words, it go


This is what they want, son, mansions and yachts
For a taste of it, the'll off ya top, ayo
This is what they want, son, big dreams and CREAM
Bitches ride like the Scream Machine
This is what they want, son, but they fail to get
Cuz the radio don't play this shit, yo
This is what they want, son, real talk on wax
Never mind bout who did the track, man


This is that get low, blow your 'dro, sip ya hypno'
Three miles a hour, NARC style in ya whip slow
Big city glow, I rest where the semis blow
And sleep with a piece, the streets won't let me go
So, I'mma rep, til I'm dead, in my physical
No, I'm not Biggie Smalls, I ain't 'ready to die'
Or ready with the infrared, his head's ready for I
Live from the mosh pit, they black Jennifer's eye
It gets like that, when you grinding in the pits like that
The overtime, never quit type cat
Stay low, posting up like Shaq
Catch me stepping in the crisp, uniform like Max in white cap
I'm back, so true to myself, I shine black
Like that, then I get you more for nine flat
I-N-S, House Gang on the plate, I buy that, like
You cross me, and ah, nine's clap, and






How I be rolling, holding my sword, Lord I be zoning
Going hard in the moment, only God can control him
I told 'em it's not a game, show 'em, know how to flame
They broken, I got 'em smoking, he stroking a lot of dames
Saying who the boss, stupid 'till you prove it, it's talk
I'm Anakin before the Dark Side, moving with Force
Of course ready steady winning the feeling
The rain heavy, confetti, bet he be toasting up
Pepsi and Henny, plenty before him had bored him
But all that saw him had soared him
He the king of the kingdom, forefront of the forum
Scoring like I'm Jordan, applaud and they support him
Reflection of what they taught him, salute him in postmortem
Don't short him, don't try, can't play him
Can't stop him, don't try, won't phase him
The money, the broads, the cars, nah they don't make 'em
The CZARFACE Part 2? That's a bold statement


You'd rather sweat out a fever in Liberia
With 50 men that fit the ebola virus criteria
With nurses dead in puke unprotected
Infected area, ice-grilling ISIS while isolated in Syria
Now that's a bold statement and it's real
I find 'em all in infuriating
Kinda like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D
With two bars kill your five man group
They got a three word vocab like "I am Groot"
Gimme Tylenol and Advil cause I'm violent of the head still
I silence all the devils when I'm wilin' with the rebel
Esoteric, I run rap like freestyling on a treadmill
I'm a giant with a pencil, modern science wants to stencil
You never get the calls and bitch about how crooked refs be
Your style's pesky, like spelling Mike Krzyzewski
Bars dumb/hot like a Fox News anchor slut
Hang it up, your hottest shit I trump it like Gillespie


It was a concocted tale that was convoluted
Lawmen and prosecutors heavily armed to shoot it
A storyboard that was rough and rugged and filled with splinters
Courtroom colder than the Alaskan winters
A wild dog bit the extended hand
Exposed the secret world of a tormented man, damn
In this world, loose tongues are cut with razors
Something major, inside the darkest corners of twisted behavior
The lowest and hottest places on Earth
Large pools of sulfuric acid marks the turf
Giant land masses that pull away
A crack in the crust no trust and the killers are willing to pay
Eruptions for years in lakes of lava
Huge dome of rock on the block that's from the plaza
The youth has risen to the challenge
Cause the grass isn't green enough but its blades are sharp as talons




Shaolin, suuuuuuu!
Where you at huh, where you at huh? (Uh huh)
Loose Linx, House Gang, Undadogz, 2-4 Warriors
(Back from the mothafuckin' dead, we 'bout to ride, the army of darkness, kid)
That's how it goes in the G-H-E-T-T-O baby! Yo, yo


We get rough, rugged and real, you won't stand still
Bottom line, it's time to let your man build
Park Hill drop heavy like a anvil
Try and to stop mine, wind up in the landfield
Now where it's good at, tell me where the hood at
Hustlers, thugs, dimes, and the hood rats
I live the wild life, roam with a wolf pack
Quick to pull gats, bangers, and wood bats
Big cups of gin, dubs spin, lifestyles so exquisite, the buzz on in
He's the rebel, we jump off above the rim
Big timers in the grime got love for him
Not a fake nigga wit' a hundred grand in stones
Lookin' fly in the bid, but he can't come home
Always talkin' 'bout packin' the nine
Tell me how all these rappers catchin' body, nobody catchin' time
I don't know about half of you kids
Some of y'all ain't been past the precinct for smackin' ya wiz
You probably wouldn't last through a bid
How many made bangas out of bed frames and macaroon lids
From up north to down state, back to the crib
This is real life, you hype, save your act for the flicks
I mash on the script, slit fashion in sick
Flow fresh like a sandpit passin' ya wig, fool!
Uh, where you at huh? Come on, where you at huh?


Yeah I'm still stuck in the Stat
Yeah I'm still hungry mothafuckas, stomach touchin' my back
So like, yeah I'm still clutchin' my gats
Tryin' to make a mil' off of crill still fuckin' with cracks
I said you know I'm still servin' the heads
And I eat through the beep, don't sleep, never heard of a bed
And I'm just a little over the edge
I see ghost when I smoke, and just a little over your head
I said yeah I'm still stackin' my cake, and I don't care if you share
Cause I still don't mind snachin' the plate
And I still don't mind catchin' the case
These niggas runnin' they jibs, I'm do a bid, behind crack in they face
Put the steel to the back of they face, and I squeeze with ease
If they hesitate, I'm crackin' of the safe
And I'm still movin' packets of base
And I pass out bombs, you pass out when I back out arms
I said yeah, still Cash that Don
Ten brown from the twin pounds, ten rounds to smash upon
And I send hounds to snatch ya moms
Niggas playin' till them shots start sprayin', then they ass is gone


Do it mothafucka, we got you!
Loose Linx, Homicide Housing, come on!


Hot time in the city, I get it poppin' and crackin'
Crackin' and poppin', you askin' who is he
I'm a House Gang Animal, bear grizzly
Y. Million, still ride with me, count those lies
Remember never trust a bitch, if you a cloud in the sky
And we at you mothafuckas, ain't no question to why
So many shots that your body would fry
Verrazano Bridge, Homicide Housing S.I., nigga that's what it is
Calm your man down, hold your bid
Carlton Fisk, hold down, orchestrate the strip
If the feds come I plead the Fifth
Send men, then I blaze the fifth, I'm not a stranger to this
It don't matter if you Blood or Crip, thug or bitch
My House Gang Animalz will flood your strip, nigga
(Yeah, yeah, where you at huh,  where you at huh?)


What's good for the goose is good for the gander, and also
Bustin' is good, but missin' you bad with your hammer
Yeah, you get you man up, but karma is real
The dirt that we do if we sleep, sure creep up in the jammas
Coincide with me, what was saved refuse my thinkin' of what I'm plannin'
Then catch you like ducks and air the cannon
I got thug Law and Order on my side, y'all kinda got strength
But it ain't fear if law enforcements your side
Niggas popped at me, I ain't respond
Before I had a chance to clap, half police bureau respond
Print my picture, askin' around, "where is this nigga?"
Activist, call respondin' to get to buildin' then figures, I know
Ya'll been jealous, been knockin' my hustle
I probably been bitten' if money wasn't like muscle, you feel it?
We in the jungles, what's keepin' me safe is prayers to myself
And the un-seen force of my mother, her spirit
Properly guides me, mainly from snakes beside me
Watch me, while creepin' in the lobby


Uh, where you at huh? Come on, where you at huh?



"He who write the songs.." - repeated throughout the intro


Festos (who got it, huh, who got it?)
Underdawgz in the building, U.D.'s (who got it, huh, who got it?)
Streetlife, Size/7, what, Johnny Blaze (who got it, huh, who got it?)
Yeah, what, it's a Shaolin thing y'all, get familiar


Truth scholar, you holla up the few dollars
I work it overtime, whether white or blue collar
I prove my honor, cuz I been through the drama
Wu-Chronicles, and I continue the saga
Chart topper, rhyme tough as body armor
When I speak, I hold the globe like a Dalai Lama
The flow is aqua, pa, you swimmin' wit the known piranha
The soul father, get to know my whole persona
Like Shaquana, from Guyana, stay lace in cabana
For papa, she shake her tata's like maracas
Fiend for the block opera, your top sponsor
Got you locked in the scope of the rocket launcher
Stop your offers, cop mine, I drop it monster
Let the rhyme inside your mind like chocolate ganja, it's the worst


He, who writes the songs, he, who writes the songs (who got it, huh, who got it?)
He, who writes the songs, he, who writes the songs (who got it, huh, who got it?)
He, who writes the songs, he, who writes the songs (who got it, huh, who got it?)
He, who writes the songs, he, who writes the songs, he..


I supply the fire, let your headsets be the bomb
One song, give you pipe dreams like Cheech & Chong
Got dough, cop and go, all else breeze along
Be strong, the high last four weeks long
Get your eat on, she'll hold you til the fever is gone
Got you cold sweatin', and up creepin' til dawn
Wide eyed, off the side, no sleepin' on morn'
O.D.'ing, just the side effects, so, please be warned
Son, I raise your blood pressure like tight jeans and thongs
Guaranteed like throwin' the bomb to Keyshawn
Put your peeps on, I spice it up like Dijon
We be, ease to calm, to the streets we belong
Don't be alarmed, cuz indeed the heat is on
So hot, to touch me, you need tweezers and tongs
If I breathe on the mic, it's left weakened and torn
Til he gone, you'll be leanin' like your sneakers are worn, off the worst




I got the works, like a Burger deluxe, you heard it was us
Got You All in Check like Dirty and Bust'
Play dirty and rough, remain thirsty for bucks
Seein' dollar signs like today's the first of the month
Dunn, it hurts when I touch, flames burst off the verses I bust
Some wanna scuff, but ain't worthy enough
What? I burn you up rookie, just hang your jersey up
I'm on the east side, workin' at a Mercury truck
Seen me servin' up the uncut, that certainly crush
Murderous, first to bust, expert in the clutch
That's my word up, loose links, lurk in the cut
On the re-up, be sure to catch a third degree rush
Here's your beat up, I keep the cut, verbally plush
Keep a burnin' Dutch, heat tucked and burgundy chucks
Won't you turn it up, them wit the girlies, they lust
It's the dopeman, my jams run your thirty and up, it's the worst








You rapper... you big, buyin' the chain out the back of The Source
Your whole style is cubic, dun, aiyo, aiyo
Yo, yo, aiyo, yo, yo, aiyo


Who live as us, streets vibin'
Freaks linin' up, cuz we shinin'
Pretty mama go on, do that dance
Cuz after the jam, we slidin' into two black vans


And we out to the double tree, shorty she lovin' me or
She love the fact, we got weed and bubbly
Lovely, sounds bang out the Benz buggy
Mami got a fat ass, plus her friend for me
Ya'll keep try'nna front, meet I.N
Keep ridin' us, cuz we grindin'
From the front to the back of the club
We them knuckleheadz actin' up, and that's what's up
Crack that cognac and pass the cup
Had me, come out the throwback and match ya tough
I'm comin' with the mask and gloves, to stack the doves
And everything after that is love
Who's that? That's your cuz, back with us
Throw your hands up, and catch the buzz
But yo, Baby Boy, though I'm not Tyrese
My initials, Deck, but two, I.D., and where you find me
Slowly floatin' in a new fly V
Cruisin' down the side streets with a true dime piece
And I spit nothing less then exclusive
Dressed in the newest, 'Festo, ride with The Movement


Who live as us, streets vibin'
Freaks linin' up, cuz we shinin'
Smokin' tri-colored weed in a bong
Greasin' this song, for g's, got freaks in they thong


Ya'll keep try'nna front, meet I.N
Keep ridin' us, cuz we grindin'
Got a jones for those big faced bills
Chicks, they grill, see me when I hit 8 mil, bitch...



Fuckin around, its that the fuckin clown?
40 Cent? (uh-huh)
If you real thing, cuz you was here
You'll be fuckin dead, you hear me cock-sucker, DEAD!


Yo, yo, yo
Who the hell is 50 Cent? Crook with a deal
Keep talkin, you gon' meet a crook with a steel
You really want beef, I'mma hand you war
Got big guns, shit you never seen before
Just a no-name nigga, seekin the rep
'bout to take aim, spit a hot flame in your chest
Although everythin was cool, had to start wildin
Front all you want, but not on Shaolin
Point blank, simple and plain, you small change
Tear you up out of the frame from close range
Fake 50 Cent tryin to face the best
Wanna impress me? Let me see you fake your death
Until then, you herb, don't deserve respect
What possesed you? Who gave you the nerve to flex?
God bless you, I'mma lay your soul to rest
Think about it next time you'll pose a threat


2x
Who the hell is 50 Cent? Cornball frontin
'nother studio thug, ain't hurtin nothin, nigga
And your raps ain't built for that
On the real, niggas get killed for that


So you wanna stick the Gods for they funny-ass rings?
How dare you? Clip your wings and straight aim
You be careful, how you mention the name
Speaks codes, I violate your clan like parole
Who want it? Run in your lab without a warrant
What you gon' do now? Got your ass cornered
Feel a squad closing in, from all angles
Hit you, split you from your ass to your ankle
Let my dogs eat your food, hear my wolves howl at the moon
Lock down your body, leave the room
You fake fuck, wanna start with us?
Anybody ever told you, you talk too much?
Niggas want mine, I'mma put five on your bucket
Shine on the wrist, cost more than your budget
Who you? Face it, your whole camp doo-doo
Wanna get it on, nigga do you, fake fuck


2x
Who the hell is 50 Cent? Cornball frontin
'nother studio thug, ain't hurtin nothin, nigga
And your raps ain't built for that
On the real, niggas get killed for that


Yo, I lay long enough, for you cowards to eat
It's time to apply pressure, devour the streets
Yo, it seems another crab, like runnin his mouth
Where he at? Point him out, and I'm callin him out
Make his chick nod the head like she's suckin me off
Keep it raw, meat combat with the dog, dustin me off
No joke, you ain't never seen gun smoke
Nickel pump bastard, stick to playin jump rope
Who the bosses? Power like thoroughbred horses
With more guns than armed forces
You ain't ready, overnight joker
Strip you like poker, your bullshit's over
Give it to me raw, I want mine the foul way
Small change in this game, nigga like a child's play
Motherfuckin coward


2x
Who the hell is 50 Cent? Cornball frontin
'nother studio thug, ain't hurtin nothin, nigga
And your raps ain't built for that
On the real, niggas get killed for that


Fuckin 40 Cent
4 dimes and a nickel, God
I challenge you, thats right
Fuckin cheesy boy
Cream Team niggas see you boy
You better have your shit out
You better have your shit right, nigga
YouknowI'msayin?
We the flavoury niggas
We fuckin flavoury niggas
You fuckin coward
Trying to come in this shit
You know I'm sayin'?
We out here, you just small change



 + (samples)
(Make me yours) He get out of line, break his fucking arm...
You know how it go (What am I supposed to say? Yeeaaah)
You know, word up, not playing the games, with these niggas, man
(Somebody tell me what do I do...)
None at all, man... hit 'em off, none of that, man


Aiyo, jump out the Acura, crazy heavy, what's popping?
Us locking the game, word to every hand on the locman
Street gwop, everybody eats, sweep blocks
This is a message, ain't go no grams, we gon' beatbox
Study like lessons, niggas in the game biting the grain
You knowing where it came from, stop it
You thought we wasn't coming? You dumbing, you blunted again
Watch Lex get that dough out ya pocket, rhyme all 'pallegic
Can't nothing move when I rhyme, when I drop lines it's law out in Egypt
Love ups, don't need no batteries now, what?
The only niggas that'll glow'll be us
Yo, throw me in Sin City, leave me with the vultures and bats
Then give me two weeks to bubble like Kim titties
Dirt Dog, we miss you, now it's time to murder the game
Cuz if things change, you know it ain't against Wu


What am I supposed to say? Yeeaaah
Somebody tell me what do I do...


We keep it hot, keep the heat on the block
We never stop, drawing water up until it begin to drop
Raining with the patchwork of puzzles
That was written in the year of the dragon
More raw than you could ever imagine
How much of a great blessing to a rap city
Where the youth is organically fed, from the Witty
Unpredictable, Talent And Natural Game is lyrical
Analyze the picture, the portrait, the visual
A Cuban Link Chef cooks spaghetti that's untied
RAGU nigga whose tomatoes are sundried
He gave y'all niggas whiplash from bling bling
But my rhyme'll give ya hot flash and moodswings
Math shed light on divine secrets, then science leaked it
For the lower level creatures that can't peep it
I observe MC's, regardless
From a neighboring world which is ten times the sharpness...




Let the track wind and ya mind flow free
Remain conscious on this ride to ya best ability
Infinity, back to the source of which it came
Energy, see it change forms, atoms being born, never ending
On and on and on and, travel with me
Not trying to convince the pack, that it's a fact
For those who can't adapt, I lived it, shitted it back
We have agreed, you'll feel the impact of the truth when I'll squeeze
The brain feels something pop, hip hop, locked in texts
Fat checks, fly whips, jewelry, chicks
Enough kicks, fitted crown, buttoned down
Underneath the white T lies the four pound
This is forty-five minutes of menacing
Dismantling, any MC opponent stepping in the zone
Get ya face blown (Get ya face blown)




Observe the word, when I speak, get the truth's heard
True to the curb, Wu classic is the new birth
Spreading the blessing across seven continents
Arm of the trench, there's no form of defense
Entertainment, nine swords swing rapid
Check the techniques, first bow to The Abbott
Witty Unpredictable, gritty individual
Valid, if it's Actual, Talent and it's Natural
Game, rugged like the train, pump it in ya vein
I and I ride or die under the name
W-U, the primary, ya secondary
Definitely not necessary, the legendary
You printed the blueprints to do this shit
Moving the youth in the bricks
Spit poison tipped darts that rip hearts
Through the chest, when I manifest my sick art


Speaking my mind, fall in line when I spit mine
Still in my prime, still'll shine til it quit time
If this is a crime, find me guilty, I'm so sublime
So rapid with rhymes, sayin' I'm slacking is assonine
Revealing the truth, catching feelings, it's still the Wu
Gorilla the booth, body armored, them killa proof
In living proof, I'm the Wittiest Unpredictable
Most Talented rap muthafucker you ever listened to


I'm a hustler, I grind til my pack is done
Give a seed mad knowledge til they crack and run
Can't nobody fuck with me, I'm just too nice
Smack niggas in they head everytime I write
Yo, I'm straight from Park Hill where the guns is popping
Where them little black kids do they grocery shopping
Go to school fucked up, it's Africa Island
We poor in the bricks but inside it's nothing but talent




You know where I come from, (Know where I'm from)
(It's that boy) Shaolin baby


S.I.N.Y. 10304, S.I.N.Y. 10304
S.I.N.Y. 10304, S.I.N.Y


Yes this shit is raw comin at your door
Ya start to scream out loud Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hours four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights and plus the cold war
Everybody face down on the floor before Hell break loose
Like Tom Hanks rushin the shore
Brother man stay bout it for sure
Big blades on the Escalade, Gettin paid bouncin on the law
It's only just a matter of time
I'ma flat line your vital signs when I rat-a-tat with the rhyme
Don't nah nigga do it like me, White tee matchin Nikes
The blue and white fifty-nine fifty
I watch the city like my name's Bruce Wayne
Counted loose change on a stoup hangin where my crew bang
Certified live, Duckin the five
With two pipes like Wes Snipes bustin from the side
So serious like the Gods in Medina
Street sweeper buck shots, The quake off the rictor
Gotta have it, Brother Osh popped the 'matic
Supreme team, Bags and beams, Rockin carrots
Can't nobody stop my grind, Bottom line
If it's on I'll put a fool in a box for mine
And I'm only gonna warn you once
Chew on this, Food for thought, Smash all your fronts
And I'ma eat yall frauds for lunch
Chump ass niggas ball for stunts, We fuck broads in a bunch
You ain't gangst, Son your soft, It's evident
For my thugs doin life I'm forced to represent
Watch the V12 sit on chrome
The same love I get outta town watch I get at home
Left shorty back blown when she hit that dome
It's like that when I get that jones, When I'm in that zone
This is for the die hard who ride hard
In every zip code switchin fresh cloths and fly cars






Smooth getaway, yeah
One time on my ass (getaway)
'Bout to make this hundred yard dash...
With the cash


I'm fleein the crime scene on the major decon
Power steerin, lost the handle in the Jeep spin
Deep in the seat, high persuit by the precinct
My co-defendant turned stake and let the beast in
They rush my old Earth lab, grabbed 50 g's cash
In the stash and let the Glock splash
Sun dash down the fire escape past the weed gate
The weed gate, thought it was a sting, popped the tre' 8
Jakes givin chase, now the dread's my 'space
I was creepin down the staircase, we met face to face
In the lobby, cold stares, show no fear
We out for now, but next time we might go there
Cuz po's here, must've turned down the walkie talkie
I thought I heard one tell the other that he caught me
Damn, they got my man, he knows shit
Bitch nigga that I rolled with told shit
I layed low, 007 'til I get dark
He told where my wiz lives and where the whip's parked
Got my address off the license plate
That eliminates, headin to my next restin place
Uncertain, my wiz peaked from behind the curtain
It seen the high beam from the chicky lurkin
The high speed chase, got my swervin
I needed a diversion, crashed in the side of a suburban
In the mirror, I'm starin at the eyes of the law
Couldn't jump out, fucked up the driver side door
Called China, meet me in a half with the pathfinder
No time to talk, I'll fill you in when I find ya
Stopped at a neighborhood diner, brought me some attire
And swore to hold me down under fire (echo)


The word on the street, they can't trace my rap sheets
Still I creep swift, tryin to slip all heat
The word on the street, this thing's way beyond deep
Promise me you'll keep ya mouth close and don't leak
The word on the street, the evidence's concrete
My cold thief mysteriously got set free
The word on the street, the photograph
Let the beast splash through the projects, the last you weep


You bein watched like you new on the block from roof tops
Get your moves on these hot shots, pop, music stops
Party's over, bold soldier move for his holster
Shot the lights out, struck the bouncer in his shoulder
Hard times for po-9, can't control the mass' sweep
For move backstage, we sling V.I.P. passes
Jakes sprayin mace, riots takin place
When the Clan show they face, the fans show they place
Get your blunt rolled, fuck the 5-0, they want it dun' know
Bitches get tripped over, niggas wildin the front row
Fire marshall catch a beat down, tryin to cut my sound
Radio dispatcher, back-up, bustin rounds
Without intermission from a crowd's position
Bullets ricochet off the strobe-lights, strikin Christians
My nigga slipped in, 'nuff ammunition
To bust back, fuck that, them out-of-town cats gon' take the rap
It's war on the dance floor, quarter to 4
Before we peeled off, they tried to seal off the back door
Gats for the beast, high pursuit down the side streets
Shot up my getaway Jeep, crashed the front glass
Flew the head rest off the passenger seat
I grabbed the heat, ditched the whip, and then escaped on feet
While the locals interrogated for names and photos
Work for 5-0, swappin info for dough






What's wrong with these cats
Gotta constantly remind them
I'm a made man like Tony and Vinny and them
Respect due fool


Wu disciple, rude since high school
Moves on the floor like the shoes of Michael
You say your king, this dude's the rightful
50 cal flow, soundproof the rifle
Physical like Olive Newt
In Mission Impossible, Tom cruise with the lyrical blueprint
Deliver the news quick: dude's sick, lyrically ill
Still trippin off that 1-6-oh shit
Lansbury murder, he wrote
Hand heavy, every word that he quotes, like serving you dope
The nerve of these folks, they know I'm clutch like 24
Get it for free you pay twice what it cost
Calm savage bomb the masses
Put your fire out plus stomp ya ashes
I'm the maverick
Soul-sonic force, I rocks the planet


Terminator (we blast on sight)
Decapitator (don't grab that mic)
Protect Ya Neck (you can lose that head)
(wind up dead from words that were said)


You need a little danger in your life
Take a fucking chance once in awhile will ya?
What are you gonna do? Play with your prick for another 30 years?
What are you... gonna read People magazine and eat at Wendy's til the end of time?
Take a fucking chance


Kodiak jaws, titanium fangs
88 slang, gladiator tap your vein
A X-Man off the map with the realest rap
I come back with a star on the shield of cap
I seal the gap, mechanical tentacles identical to Doctor Octopus
Harry Potter books can't describe my looks
I'm part King, part Mark Twain, I'm arcane my bar is mean
Indy shit, you won't find me in a large chain
That's a double meaning, double line, my lane
I'm a Shar Pei, ugly, maneuver through the errors
You will back up like Matt Gutierrez (Whats the other one?)
Don't try and chill
Evil I am, ill, egomaniacal
Buckin at Fresh Prince, yeah I fire at will
Rap trigger rigor mortis, yeah they dying still
Lying still, they admire the skill
Collide with me I smash your entire grill
Messiah, chill, trill in a fly DeVille
Early bird executioner with time to kill


Terminator (we blast on sight)
Decapitator (don't grab that mic)
Protect Ya Neck (you can lose that head)
(wind up dead from words that were said)



They're only words
It's the context that counts, it's the user
It's the intention behind the words that makes them good or bad
The words are completely neutral, the words are innocent
I get tired of people talking about bad words, or bad language
Bullshit, it's the context that makes them good or bad
The context that makes them good or bad

The force to leave you lost like the tribe of Shabazz
Murderous material made by a madman
It's the mic wrecker, Inspectah, bad man
From the bad lands of the killer
Rap fanatic representin' with the skill that's iller
Dare to compare, get pierced just like your ear
The Shooby Doo-Wop pop, strictly hardware
Armed and geared, 'cause I just broke out the prison
Charged by the system for murderin' the rhythm
Now lo and behold another deadly episode
Bound to catch another fuckin' charge when I explode


Slammin' a hype-ass verse 'til your head burst
I ramshack dead in the track, and that's that
Rap assassin, fast and quick to blast and hardrock

Flashbacks how I attacked your whole project
I'm raw, I'm rugged and raw, I repeat
If I die, my seed'll be ill like me

So, clear the way! Make way! Yo, open the cage!
Peace, I'm out, jettin' like a runaway slave

All the meth got me open like fallopian tubes
I bring death to a snake when he least expect
Ain't a damn thing changed, boy, Protect Ya Neck
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah jam is fatal
Quick to stick my Wu-Tang sword right through your navel
Suspenseful force bein' brought through my utensil
The pencil, I bring strong winds up against you
Havoc, then run up through your county like the Maverick
Caps through the tablets, I gots to make the fabrics

Slit a nigga back like a Dutch Master

Like gettin' smashed by a cinder block
Pow! Now it's all over; niggas seein' pink hearts
Yellow moons, orange stars, and green clovers

And I'm forced to fuck it up
My style carries like a pick-up truck
Cross the clear blue yonder, sea to shinin' sea
I slam tracks like quarterback sacks from L.T.
Now why try and test the Rebel INS?
Blessed since the birth, I earth-slam your best
'Cause I bake the cake, then take the cake
And eat it, too, with my crew while we head state to state


And if you want beef, then bring the ruckus!
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthing ta fuck wit

Can't wait until ya fake ass gone
Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, you either step or get stepped upon
Nigga, uh-oh! I think they're playin' our song
Lit blunts, Clan in the front, sayin' "It's on!"


Try to Wu hate, duck, you could suck my
Watch the block get clear when I buck my
Boomerang darts, you can't duck my
No tellin' which Clan man you got struck by
Chains get tucked when he walk by, hawk eye
Arrows bein' fired from crossbow, I talk fly
You can't Etcha-sketch all my rhyme threat
Try to bite my flow, you catch ya throat strep
Soaked in cess, dope, you eat the cold Tec's
Bold flex, W crown, the ice O-X
Up in the oolie, yo, who you know?
John Bizzi, Ghost Deini, Rollie Finger and them toolies yo
Stainless Bobby, boy, you have an English folly
To try to detain the slang that we can to polly
Plus you didn't peep Irief, kid, you sleep
I seen this heap of shit, you in steep




Yo, amist the gravel, play the words of the Big Apple
Broadcastin' live from the pits of the battle
Wigs split and rattled, get shook out ya saddle
You ever hear me losin', one of y'all fix the panel
Ask who? Wu, that's true, known piranhas
Who knows drama, fathers of your whole persona
The mad doctor, stay locked in the O-R
In too deep, beyond reach of the sonar
Still a vet, say my name next to hall of fame
Hurtin' third string players, first day in the game
It's on, son, the Killa Bee swarm come
Make the world shake with one continuous drum




Wave ya gun, Killa (I got you)
Shoot this nigga in his face fast, mumblin' (I heard y'all forgot Wu)
Wear ya crown, black down (Watch the block too)
Blow at y'all niggas (Blowin' at the cops too)
Eh-yo, my wallets stay bulletproofs, racin' in Coups, yea we the realest
Ultraviolet leathers on, pealin' this, love lookin' the illest
Gorilla things, monster background with a history
You're pumpin' crack, yap clowns, we all real in here
Strap a bomb on a family member, let y'all niggas know we here
Blasted, it's like cheeba when I splashed it
Real reefer heads'll know the meanin' of hittin' glass
I told y'alls, against y'all, Ginsengs, avenge Gods
Picture me stabbin' you in the yard for R's
Kid saw Staten, nine Bin Ladens
Valors on, colorful draws, lookin' all relaxed in


Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, You either step or get stepped upon

Nigga, uh-oh! I think they're playin' our song
Lit blunts, Clan in the front, sayin' "It's on!"




This where legends get made, claim titles through the edge of a blade
Afro bro flow, smoother than '70's suede
Number one headband, hold an edge, you'se a dead man
No wrist ID's, IV's or bed pans
Sword stroke left hand, blood in the red sand
You know where I rep the desert lands where the desert blam
Queens baby working my heavy hands, dudes call him Afro
Get sliced down from wig piece to asshole
And y'all talk like I'm the one to listen
I'm on a long mission, dude is gone fishing
Seven thirty early, you beating the dog fisherman
I don't chase 'em or replace 'em, I fish 'em in
I take a rib shot, and walk away whistling
Plot on tops of the five fam at the christening
Bubble goose, double loop like the Michelen man
Streets of N.Y.C. to the Michigan, man


Boy, you know, you already know, boy, you already know
Boy, you know, you already know, boy, you already know
Boy, you know, you already know, boy, you already know
Boy, you know, you already know, boy, you already know


Straight out the woods, where the hoods don't come
It's the legend and I'm second to none, son it's better to run
Try and test before you get to ya gun
You gon' leave wit ya head in the trunk
Sho' nuff I'm a beast on the strength, realize
You done said ya last words once I reach for the hip
Man don't even give me reason to flip, it's the season to flip
You know the drill, so don't even resist
The kid lives wit the blade, one wit the jungle
Calm and I'm humble, but I said it in the rage
I'm looking for some getback, getback
I'm quick to push ya wig back, nigga shouldn't have did that
Now I'm on your ass like tight pants
All across mountain top, deep water and highlands
See me, see the Indian dance, for all ya'll
I'm death in the flesh, remember my face
