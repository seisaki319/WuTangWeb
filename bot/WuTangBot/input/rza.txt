Bobby said, "Fuck spending fifty on a whip, buy equip"
Mental flip, he got a thousand tracks stored on a chip
Said he had mad toys to make noise
He split and separate drums like asteroids
The concerned producer sampled this question
Hit him with the beat for the answer with extra compression
My sound travel, it quickly grab you
And equalize the pitch up, until it have you
Bugged out, tryna think you can match this
The portraits are too graphic
Panoramic view for you, stamp Wu
The beats are Gothic, the outcome will be catastrophic
We roadblocked it, checkpoints on your next joint
Now who the nigga you anoint?
700 volts on the track to slay
Murderous wordplay displayed from killing cascades
Throwing bullets in the air to test wind
Which way the cyclone spin? Counter or clockwise?
Still civilized
Kill spies on the wall as still flies, all dies


Give no extension on the lynching
It's tension if the name of the Clan is mentioned
It's the aura that's felt that causes one to flash his gun
And reveal how he really feel, confirmed
He'll never live after the show
See the promoter for the dough I'm taking, breaking his wax
Throwing my shit on to perform the selection from the Swarm
Day 2 breaks, it's a stormy Monday
My ninjas lay in ravines and ditches underneath shrubs and leaves
They breathed through underwater reefs
The enemy walks above, Clan remains subterraned in mud
Off shore banks, tanks approach the location
Bombarded by the circle of death formation
Telecom lines are sniped from these low altitude strikes
Shattering bulletproof helmets with shrapnel fragments of cell
Inhale these venomous thoughts that I propel
Through the north facility, the city must suffer
At the hand of the Chief's command, volts are sent
At three minute intervals the heat intenses
Deadening the power from electrical fences
Defences are down, shake a nigga up
Bounce him off the sound


You know what I'm saying?
The God ca-diver, in the streets of Iris
We talk about sex, money and drugs
(Ruled by power) And y'all cats don't know
What it's about (Love and power)
It goes deeper than what you see on TV
Killah Priest, come on


Burning desire, ebony eyes
Painted toenails, legacies die
Women by the well, Egyptian queens
Arabian sheiks paid to knock off rich kings for the joy some sing
Graveyards filled with scarlet widows
Who stabbed they husbands sleeping on silk pillows
Blood on they robes, disguised as beggar in cheap wool clothes
Lambs and wolves in black hoods pull out they gats
Like magic wands, casting spells, sending niggas to Hell
Trapping they souls in realms
Baptize them with Holy Water
Springing on the heads of plenty witches' daughters
Interviews with the richest reporters, silent nights over Nevada
A thousand Muslims bow before the Kaaba
Hebrews flee to the hills of Masada
For the love of God, guns make a loud sound
I'mma show you how thugs get down
Shootouts, bullets turn into bloodhounds and hunt you down
Cursed nation, lost generation
X-Files found them in the future as cosmic rulers
Fallen angels from space intruders
Dying saints, blood spilled on the floor like wet paint
See it in the pictures, read it like the lost scriptures
Absorb it with your 100 proof liquor


I shot the sheriff and the deputy secondly
Threatening the lives of those who threaten me
Lessening my chances of defeat by predetermining the victory
As taught by Sun Tzu in the chapter, after the third one
I heard my word shall be born, regardless to anything or anyone
Or else I die by the gun, my life has just begun
Thought I was living all along, but I was wrong
This long road I have to travel in countless battles
These filthy snakes with poison fangs and rattles
Kings, queens and pharaohs change to cattle
Unable to duck the Devil's arrow
Singing that his eye's on the sparrow, mind narrow
Superstitions, horoscopes and tarots
'Hark Heralds Angels' and Christmas carols
Graven images hang from the mantels
Man-made slaves in modern day Babel
Brought from Africa in golden robes and sandals
By wicked thieves and vandals
Who manhandled us with leather whips and burning candles
And rambled through our castle, leaving niggas shambles
Stole our golden sodas like some Arab camels
We gazed, amazed and baffled as he loaded his ammo
Into the barrel and blasted out our bone marrow
We were the Gretel and the Hansel, tricked by this wicked jackal
Children of my grand-old-daddy have me
In mind when they're lost in this wilderness blind




Unable to become immortalized in life
Ghostface became immortalized in death
Creating a mayhem so vast
That the tale of his rampage would be passed down for generations
Gangsters told their children to never double-cross a man
Who's will is so strong that he can cross the planes of existence
To get his revenge
And there you have it
The story of the Ghostface Killah




16th Chamber, temple number five


Somebody said it's on, if it is then I'll be set
To blow a nigga up, with my Five Fingers of Death
I bring it to his whole damn fam, understand
If he frontin, on any man down with the Clan
I be comin, for that headpiece you can't cope
For my brother, I even kill a Pope, word to mother
Serial, killa, style from the Isle of Stat
My peoples are you with me where you at?
Shit's gettin deep in here, I mean like thick
Niggas lookin all in my face like they want dick
It's about to hit the fan, hit the flo'
That's all I can stands, and I can't stands no mo'
What is it? Niggas think they bigga
Because they got the finga on the trigga of a biscuit
They don't know I'm wicked, when I start to kick it
With the raw sound, wash it down with a Mystic
Better yet a Snapple, nigga want the juice
But he don't want the hassle
Thought they trying to overthrow the castle
Better yet the temple, I'm comin to your town
Black down, the rental, car, the pistol
YAH! If you don't want a burn from Glock
Then beware, I buck shots, meaning what, the buck stops
Here, no more dough will be made
Unless it's being made by who... the 1-6-Ooh

 + (Method Man)
Chamber four (1-6-Ooh) Chamber four
Temple number nine, temple number nine


I'm the original G-O-D
Making young ladies scream is my specialty
When I go ooh-wah, ooh-wah, ooh-wah, girls wanna get hype
From the funky fresh music that was stereotyped
When I kill, that ol' mad rugged flow
Not sayin Ason, is like a duck of disco
Or a disco duck, I'm strictly hip hop
Yo, Ason, what's up? I can't stop...
Wu-Tanging, flipping the script and
You could test my skills, but niggas must be trippin
Coked up from sniffin, you're the one who's riffin
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
You start to flip, now ya slip, cuz you're slippin
While you sleep I be the God on point, like Scottie Pippen
As I, jump on stage, cold flip a rip a show
Strip or rip a ho, ready like Bo
Jackson while I'm still taxin, I'm maxin
Relaxin, sittin backs and, laying tracks and
Again and again when I rock this jam
I wanna see 'em up in the air, throw up your hand
Introducin, the one-man band
A child that's wild, now with the style, couldn't stand
Niggas wanna jump, then stepped, to the center
Of the rhyme inventor, MC tormentor
You get jacked and slapped, across the MC map
I laugh at ya ass, on a horse shack
Come on through I black and blue your whole crew
Then I get rudie with the Hong Kong Phooey
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, MC killer
Money maker, Brooklyn, Shaolin style
That I lay down like tile
Gotta hit you up, one blaow, so you better come down...



 (x2)
Suicide it's a suicide, biddy bye bye
Suicide it's a suicide


So you wanna die, commit suicide
Dial 1-800-Cyanide line
Far as life, yo it ain't worth it
Put a rope around your neck and jerk it
The trick didn't work
Your life was fucked up from the first day of birth
After watching Jackie Gleason walk into a precinct
Gun down the captain for no fucking reason
And get some LSD or a drink from the bar
Get behind your wheel and crash the car
Like Desert Storm, got bombs for the war
Confront an alligator, let it eat ya raw
Back to the function, riding the caboose to hell
BZZZZZT touched the third rail
You fucked up chicken, now you just got fried
Cause it's a suicide




Hey you little rich kid, what's your beef?
Come and tell the Grym Reaper all of your grief
You asked for a Benz and you only got a Jeep
Your pop's got ends, but yo he's mad cheap
Maybe you're a bastard child you think
Mom and dad are white and you're dark as ink
Maybe you're Sicilian with a tan
But you hate lasagna and the pizza man
Now you stand on the grave digga plot and
You're singing the blues about the rough life you've got
(Not!) You don't wanna live no more
I guess you're really ready for the grave yard tour
When you get home, just seal up your windows and you doors
Turn your oven on high for about four hours
Light you a blunt, kiss your ass goodbye
You gassed yourself, cause it's a suicide




Yep, I've said it before and I'll say it again
Life moves pretty fast
If you don't stop and look around every once in a while
You could miss it


Six fucking devils stepped up playing brave, God
Had the fucking nerve to try and enter my grave yard
I'm the Rzarector, be my sacrifice
Commit suicide and I'll bring you back to life
The first was convinced
Stuck a water hose in his mouth at full blast so his head can explode
Second one said, "Hmmmm, that's good but I can top it!"
Put an ax up to his head and then he chopped it
Blood shot out in every direction
The rest didn't know what to do, I made suggestions
Put a slug in your mug; overdose on a drug
Wet your hand, stick a knife in the plug
Or be like Richard Pryor set your balls on fire
Better yet, go hang yourself with a barbed wire
Three and Four fell deep into the spell and
Ran to the zoo, locked themselves in the lion's den
Number Five said, "It ain't worth being alive!"
Smoked a dust joint, mixed it with cyanide
The only one who escaped was number six
He went home, sat in the tub, and slit his wrists
Yeah, more graves to dig. Goodbye
There's no need to cry...cause we all die



* all stuff in () are Blue Raspberry


Suicide... a suicide
I can't take it (suicide)
I've failed, I've failed
For one who has disqualified himself from mankind (suicide)
Now I've dealt the deadly blow (suicide)
A suicide (suicide) cuz I felt inept to carry the knowledge
The mission (suicide) to teach the uncivilized
(Suicide) WHY!?

It was a pitch-black night
The frost from the trees cradle light
From the moon, as my soul took flight
Upon my bypass, covered my eyes fast
The comfort, going through turns, blown thru a trumpet
Floating on clouds of hands, outstanding Qurans
That blessed my tan, but took me back as man
Brothers that I met, caught in nets suspended
When my strength for them, is the pendant
Attempts taste the sour grapes the hate
The fame, sliced his own vein
Escape, the living, I see things different
As I cry, to end it all and just die
Yo, a suicide is a suicide
A suicide is a suicide

(Suicide)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, a suicide)
(A suicide, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, ah, ooh)


Hey little bourgeois kid stop yelling
Come tell the Grym Reap' why you're rebeling
Your friend Marty got a new Maserati
His brother Arty got a brand new Ferrari
It really offends you to see all of your friends do better
So ask your pops for a Benz, you got a sweater
A pair of slacks, and a '94 Jetta
Shit was butter, but instead of
Gratitude, your attitude was rash and rude
Irrationally you started a feud
Now you Stand on a Gravedigga lot singing the blues
About the rough life you've got
You refuse to abide by the rules
Prescribed for life, as you grab a knife
You fool, commiting suicide, I will spit on your grave
It's barbaric as living in a cave

(Suicide, suicide, suicide, suicide)
(Ohh, ohh, oh, ah, ooh)
(Suicide, suicide, suicide, suicide)


Yo, your life, you don't want it, your braincells, been blunted
Better run to your lab son and dial 1-800-
Suicide, so you and I can unify, U-N-I-T-Y
22nd generation, it's time for the Devil's elimination
The death that you're facing goes on without discrimination
Become attracted to my magnetic
All snakes who face jakes get strung, hung, mutilated, beheaded
Fang is shredded, then thrown to a sea of premium unleaded
Gas, get the match strike it and set it
On your ass, said you wanted to go over the rainbow
Well, you'll get strangled with a hot cup of Drano
Or fill your grill with a million sleeping pills
Make you drive a 100 miles per hour blindfolded down Snake Hill
The pick, the sickle or the shovel it's got you puzzled
It's the blind, deaf and dumb, well I come to dig them out the rubble
Double trouble, triple sickness, plus genocide applied
Equal suicide, a suicide is a suicide

Suicide is a suicide (suicide)
Suicide is a suicide (suicide)
Suicide (suicide)
Suicide, suicide (suicide)
Suicide (suicide)
Suicide (suicide)
Suicide (suicide)

Gravediggaz, kid (suicide)
Trying to stay alive in '95 (suicide)
(suicide, suicide, suicide, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Respect (ooh, ohh, ohh)
(Suicide)



Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park


Locksmith, I go in unorthodox
Verbally vaccinate any rapper that sort of pop
My conversation's a combination of condamnation
You kinda hatin'?
Then you watin' with the corpse of Pac
I'm the best we got
Stop denyin' me
So many plain rappers sayin they fly; it's irony
I will eat 'em all, Tech bring 'em in
I'mma clean his skin
You can have his bones on the Wake Up Show


Allow me to set the pace for Revolution, King Tech and Sway
World famous, respected, go protect your neck with a brace
The realest radio rebels repping the west to date
Crowds - they forever stay moving 'em like they pepper sprayed
Every day, all day - always dropping exclusives
Spinning authentic rhythms not just popular music
It's Kam Moye, boy how could I not introduce him
On the Wake Up Show no man's stopping the movement


OK, Melle Mel, Makaveli, 40 Fonzarelli, Akinyele and Celly Cel
Weezy, Jeezy, Kanyeezy and Bun B
Easy-E, EPMD, Cube and Run DMC
Chuck D, Jay-Z, AZ, Lil' Kim, Eminem and Kool G
Black Thought, Mac Dre, Snoop and Kweli
Drop them names, cause hip hop ain't all about me!


Wake Up Show soldier; first infantry
You're fin' to be certainly worked into the verses in me
Purposely turned into t-searchin' to B. turfin' in burgundy
Lurkin' the streets; jerkin' this heat
Tech Nina's murkin' this beat
Wake up show brands 'em
Fans come at random
Hand 'em jams that damns them
I be givin 'em tantrums
My fam, son, is Sway and Tech, they the best and some
Trav and Tech in the phantom
This is the fuckin' anthem


Wait a minute, wait a minute cut this shit
Man, what you gon' do now?
What we gonna do right here is go back
How far you goin' back? Way back
As we go a little something like this
Hit it


Yeah, Hieroglyphics, we purveyors of dangerous language
Somewhat of a sadist, I bring it with or without my stainless
With "The World Famous", made it by banging out them bangers
We out killing the killers, out-slanging the slangers
Orangutans are concerned with how their chains dangle
I got a mouth full of stingers
Harangue you, my aim hit from angles
Main attraction coming, we're a race of angels
Bringing back exactly what the game been lacking, thank us


Yo, my genetic make-up: deoxyribonucleic cake up acid
Make the most fatherless bastard shape up
Now wake up like the radio show
Digi' got the crazy-o flow
Make a lazy party ho
Move like it's cardio, exercise
You sway when the Tec surprise
Got the drop on your knot
Wu-Tang specialize
Lyrics from a poison pen
Noise turns boys to men
Have them avoiding sin
My will can employ the wind


I go with the flow like ripples through HO
You not Nas, I'm not Kelis, but I hate you so much right now
A. I owe you: like vowels
Revenge, I'm bigheaded this my down syndrome style
Got who's who to lynch, the Wake Up Show Grinch
Medulla School a computer, the ruler like twelve inch
Rappers is menstruating, watch me rise to the challenge
Like the Washington Monument I'm just one tall phallus


My flow's on it like the AllSpark
This moment is hallmark
Hall of fame player, knocking them out the ball park
I'm all heart - you on the contrary a small mark
In the scheme of the hustle you playing a small part
I'm from the city where they sing It Never Rains In Cali
Sway and Tech Wake Up Show - tag it in the alley
It constantly jumps off - you bound to get bumped off
You bringing me static by habit I let the pump off


You listen to the world's famous Wake Up Show



With a, gun in my face, I flashback on the lives
That I managed to encounter, how we traded our vibes
Split second, saw the score, this can't be how I die?
I saw it clear in the back of my mind, no lie and...
*These are... the things that I remembered*
Calvary: How to be in private school and ghetto
Class of 99, we had our eyes on the medal
Had my mom married Geppetto, I'd still hold the control
Elementary: programming our minds into a hole
But learned to seek out the soul of a man, and expose it
Mixed race clan, in photos, I've posed with
White kids, Mexicans, Arabs, Africans
Both light skins and brothers who were blacker
Then, 9th grade I waxed into the mind of mobster
Fed from the strains on the love from my father
So I learned to be silent in my suffering like a martyr
Niggas bout the pie, til they realize you can bake
But if we slicing up the Sqrilla, I don't care which slice you take
Without vision, saw my fate was a maze I won't escape
And all was fine in my mind, until I seen it
That the fruit of creation is the attraction to Venus
So lean in to contemplate and find the meaning in between it
Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers
Starburst, Skittles, Now & Laters
Party Favors, Save the gold coins from Chuck E. Cheese
Now grown, and run to Vegas, cuz we on a chase for paper
But this Caesar's, not the playground
They will rape you out your sleeves
Break you to your knees, for those G's like Pesci
They say the world's not cold if you keep a colder Pepsi
But we're messy and selfish, for steak and shellfish
Most will metaphorically, eat your face for breakfast
Snatch you out that necklace, Lexus and Presidents
A new order coming to the world, it's getting evident
All the while, we never quit, in-spite of what we're dealing with
But if we all stopped today, we kill it, right?
As I proceed with these dreams of being Diddy
Seems like such a waste when our economy is shitty
When I'm low and look for pity, not an hour from my city
Mr. Gordy did the same thing with Motown over 50
Years ago, and here's a flow ahead of it's development
SWAMP Up! Natural growth is what I represent
Pop recommended that I watch the Earth revolve
Because the answers stay the same for how our problems should be solved
So as I'm steady on the job, the world keeps turning
Bopps are still bopping and the blunts are still burning
A man like me can only be concerned with bigger pictures
Meanwhile, everyday another obstacles delivered
I struggle to remember all the things that he said, like
"Life is like a Y, the left road will leave you dead" and
"When you meet a lady, choose her brain over her bed"
"You will know what they mean, pay attention how it's said"
We're eye to eye: he's so serious, I'm curious
What could make a father look and sound so furious
He grew delirious, I grew to understand...
That he'd given me the tools that I need to be a man
I've tried to recover all that slipped out of my hands
But sometimes, it's best to drop it and reanalyze your plan
In the quest for grands, you will lose and gain plenty
Enemies and friends, you shall match and meet many
Keep your eyes on HIM and HE won't lead you astray
Hindsight is 20/20, learn a lesson everyday
And when you fall, you pray for the strength to try again
And the wisdom to know better so the next time, you will win
Lots of fun in sin, until they send you the bill
The charges that you must accept, and some still go on your will
Generational: and hate is so, prevalent, ignore it
Choose your path, don't look back, just cruise, never floor it
And if you can't explore it, then it wasn't for you
Just define what it is that you do, and stay true




I live life lavish and my chain is karats
The last name on the train to Paris
Used to be lame then attained the merit
So many clothes can't name the fabrics
Dynamics, I want the fame
And my name engraved in granites
Here's his lane, now came to grab it
You moving sideways, change your habits
Used to rock minks, then I changed to rabbit
From out the garbage, I came from average
Used to be righteous that changed to savage
Bang my ratchet like Bangkok Dangerous
36 Chamber fist Trianglist
Watch me mangle this Star Spanglist
Rock cowboy Wrangler creating mega-hits
I'm from the grain Game at my fingertips


Yeah! Killa Hill lay it down!
Killa Bees on the swarm!
Nigga


Ayyo I plow down ? like I'm out for revenge
Fuck it, it seems like the drama never ends
Be in the projects like I never left out
Might be on Osgood, see a nigga stretched out
I can't take it seems like my hood is cursed
Bad niggas, I thought that the good was first
My old whore, she march with a foul parade
Don't learn shit til another child is sprayed
I'm out here, fuck it, like I live on ? and Rico
Keep a low cut like Margie
I don't give a fuck, y'all made me bitter
I'ma whip your kids out like a babysitter
I'ma grown man but I'm young in the mind state
Live in every borough but New York my tri-state
Test me you know I brought a bitch on the tour bus
Pour piss on you, leave you stuck for 4 months
My head fucked up, I'm off my clean streak
Don't make me pick the 9's up, I come from mean streets
My unit snitched on me, ratted me out
They all ganged up on me, tried to take my mouth
However the cause I'm in jail and get bent
They cut from dirty cloth, I'm cut from cement
Original , got the crazy glow
Them devils tried to jump me, I'm crazy though
Absolut Vodka rat crush mad Goose
O.G. all day like I be on the deuce
Pop off with it, get your army in order
Staten Africa, Islam, across that water


Yeah
Told 'em "Have Gun--Will travel"
Blowing earth metals, black son spill gravel
Bronze Man oblong javelins in my cabinet
Detroit cement salutations from the missile plant
Quick to the hollowpoint, it ain't no olive branch
My low-cal 4 0 cal. in the cardigan
Tempted by Satan put a bullet in his diaphragm
Walk around black clouds and quiet violins
A tire fire blends poet and violent pens
Illest skill, got steel plots and iron winds
Uphill need a ghetto spill, the sirens sing
Street dreams. black season, inspired kings
For fire water veins, still rain Listerine
They chains through to my "Roots", no doubt Ben Verne
On the road to riches and diamond speech
I might turn a bag of white sand in mountain peaks


I don't text to send messages
My testosterone stimulate her estrogen
Whether Black, Caucasian or the Mexican
Asian, she get the message and she coming back for sex again
Organic drugs
My natural persuasion
You under the influence of 36 invasion
Spider-man amazing but I'm darker then Parker
Skin got abrasions from Arya and Tasha
Sliding down the street cold
Pull up to your party stimulated with a Jeep full
Of jerry gap honeys and bottles of vodka
Plus the weed rolls, here we go
Mediating, never jealous, over zealous
Wu Tang's my fellowship
Fans mash up accapellas of our lyrics with Beatle tracks embellishes
The idea clearly that Wu-Tang forever
This way of life is art, rhymes and cleverness
Joined by God no man can sever this
I complete jobs free and effortless
Use tiger crane, snake style plus the leopard fist



Cat I got to take him off of here, that's right
I got to take him off of here
Cause there's only one, and that's me
You understand? 'fore all that fighting, you understand
That sucka think he good, that sucka think he can whoop me
And I know he can't whoop me, I...
Ay boy, the nigga whole style is chump
You understand?
Let me get mines first
Then after I get mines, you can do what you want to do...


Yeah, scandalous
Yeah miraculous, the arsonists


Yo, kicked down the door in the spot, 260
2L, I heard they had O's for sale
I heard the same shit, money drive a burgundy whip
Keep a low fade, license plates engraved "PAID"
Where's the cat from, think he's from New Jerusalem
Pretty Rick did his thing for him, but he was using him
Boss Sun's younger physical, you know the God
He go with Tip, the one who called Lover of God
Why Equality Self, I know the Master Allah Now
It's time to get the God U and blow like mines
But on the low I heard he got Born Original sent
Back in a drive-through Kentucky Fried shot up his Ac
We got to get him dun, aliens is snatching our bread
UFOs moving in with bigger plans than Feds, yo
Knock on Daddy-O's door get the scope
He's not home, he took Ishmael to Park Slope
There go the the dreads yo, swindle two bags of that skunk
That get you crashed out had you laid out like bums
Peace Kiana, what's up with your girlfriend Wanda
She drive a cream Honda, with legs like Jane Fonda
I just left her, she took Regine to Pathmark then
Jetted to Canal to get her man some Clarks
She should be back in ninety minutes, Ghostface
God forbid she safe, BCW was watching the kids


Two hours later, scheming like DeNiro in Casino
Son better have more coke than Al Pacino
Kiana ain't telling no lies, last year she did a sting and a half
With Tymeek bought him a aircraft
But anyway, yo, Daddy-O home, we need the shotties nid-ow
When we get back, throw you a thid-ou
Later that night, stay mesmerized yo
Go get the green 5, meet you on the corner of Now Why
You ready, you got the E&J and the machete?
We going upstairs, I hope one nigga is heavy
We walked in, both of us, looked like terrorists
Masks on, second floor, dun yo, I handle this
Kick in the crib, the whole shit looked graphical
Natural, fucking a white bitch, actual
Fiends chanting, "Do your thing Chef, handle it"
I shot him in the neck, it ricocheted and hit Carolyn
Ran to the back analyzing, much disguising
Surprise is coming in their eyes and tranquilizing
Bugging, throwing the twin cousins at his nugget, fuck it
Meet shottie waddy slug body hobby
Where the drugs, where the ounces you be bouncing
Fake cats announcing on the block, you lounging
Where the blow at, I ain't got shit, stop fronting
(Yo Chef, throw the joint in his mouth, money'll stop stunting
Bitch, hold that pit, before I push your wig back
Chef stop waving that, show him where the paper at)
Come here Valerie, you know the God he need a salary
Put down the pipe here's two tickets to a coke gallery
It's in the kitchen in the ceiling
(Baby girl kept squealing
Only found a white block of cheese from New Zealand
Ohhh shit! Yo, yo where that shit at yo?
Yo Chef, where that shit? What? What? Aiyyo...)




Yo, whats todays Mathematics?
Two plus square
The truth is the only light
Nigga stand by himself
In the surrounding of darkness
Therell be no disc shining
In the square of the universe
Which is 360 degrees
When God builds he (?)
Perpendicular to a square


Hate you on a daily
Man this shit is crazy
It ain't worth what we (?) you
Sippin till Im cloudy
Just so I can maintain
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes


I love my niggas to death, down to the last breath
But the last breath, I'm gonna save for myself
You fake snakes
Only come around when they need you
Savages, biting off the hands that feed you
Come among the righteous trying to spread that evil
Blinded by the love all these years but now I see you
For who you be and what you are to me
Tip a ray magnet trying to get a charge off me
In the old days, I would give a charge for free
But nowaday, Im charging you $100 gs
Wu-Tang is permanent
Im the illuminated (?)
Known to chops heads off at the hip hop tournament


Hate you on a daily
Man this shit is crazy
It ain't worth what we (?) you
Sippin till Im cloudy
Just so I can maintain
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes


From a small water cacoon
Bent to the shape of a quarter moon
A small water pack thats placed above the womb
I was fashioned by Allahs
All men are created equal
Then tricked with wicked lies that separated the people
Then escaped to (?)
(?)
Someone tried to shoot Mister Robert Fitzgerald
The supreme original intelligent
The Prince RZA
Somehow mistake me for a old wise wizard
I put love up against anything
I put love upon the angel wings
I put love beyond the diamond rings
With true love nothing should come between


Hate you on a daily
Man this shit is crazy
It ain't worth what we (?) you
Sippin till Im cloudy
Just so I can maintain
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes



When they ask for it, never tell em no. Let it go
Put a pen to the padits an effervescent flow
Definitely knowIm a product of the era I was brought up in
Competition slaughtering for fun
Mightve mentioned guns as a shorty for attention
Not to say they wasnt in my area, but listen
My competition, they never wanted me dead
They wanted decapitation, they saw that I was ahead
Heard that I told tales, knew that I did it well
Sisyphusean descriptionsI live in my own Hell

Its populated by heat that I hand makeflip a coin
No matter how it lands, where youre going
Is through they alleyways, back blocks, tenements
Where if he dont call a girl a bitch, hes a gentleman
Misogyny expectedSodom and Gomorrah
Scary movie mind statethe problem aint the horror

In the movies, we die in the first scene
So were all really Drew Barrymore in the first Scream
Only its set in Harlem, maybe its in Detroit
The audience prays you dont turn aroundit aint The Voice
You fall as youre running to get away
Felonious metaphor, you do a year and a day
Or die trying
Lie silent
Crack infestedsurrounded by thirst, its Rock Island
From 217 to 309, niggas open they rhyme books up and bleed on lines
Hope for some recognitionto cheat on dimes
Ladies like Changing Faces, and we dont mind

Bars over the head like snatch lifts
Dope boy antithesisrhyme with a back flip
Flip back one chapter, finish the exposition
Juice, on the roof, Im standing right next to Bishop;
Raheems dead and Steel got shot
We all know how the story endsstill I watch
Excited to see the violencedestined to See It Through
Kinda funny, back in school, I pledged: Im a Q

Grew up in the era of ass whooppins
Switches, belts, knuckles for mad lookin
Bus transfers, bummy and bad lookin
Lunchtime ciphers, dice get cash tooken

C-StyleA-dot, kind of the same guy
Aries and Virgowe should have been Gemini
Cause since shorties it was just him and I
Talking more shit than a little bit
Ignorant
Wasnt all good, but I choose how to remember it
Mention it cause he sent me the track for me to spit to it
97 Canibus, jaw dropped listening;
Nobody spit like he did, and its been a minute since
I had inspirationso I listened closely
Wondered what Id say in conversation with the old me

Stop drinking, pig is a filthy animal
If an elephants in the room, then you should be Hannibal
Scribble down in your notebook all you can manage to
Wait ten years, then publish it as the manual.




We will fight till the night is done
We will live our lives tonight as one
We will live our lives tonight as one, one


I'm a bad mother, shut your mouth
Insanity, DVD, how I stretch 'em out
What the stress about? INS best out
Fact, you knew that before he left the house
Fresh at the produce section
Gaze at my shine like a showroom necklace
Death wish, stepping in Deck's direction
I'm checking niggas like test questions


Across 110th now, cross Belmont and Montauk
Camera hawk hawks the sidewalk
When they get to flexing muscle niggas bust you
Hustlers do you, gave you your first toolie
Cutting out of school to pump your first loose leaf
Think graduate to wait, take it out of state, duct tape
Anything of pulse and heroin
Emcees frozen, cuban link chains are golden
I'm ownin' everywhere I'm holdin' it up, to keep it raw
Math here, I got 'em keep coming back for more


Yo, man, I'm so turned up, all the marijuana burned up
Y'all don't want the drama, word up
The Wu first up, the game is the world versus us
Y'all was good 'til the world heard us
Y'all ain't want them Clan birds up
Y'all don't want your man served up, that'll get the fans worked up
Homie really wanna play, stir it up
I'mma catch me a wave, surfs up
Gliding on the track like this, make me wanna act like this
Make me wanna smack that trick
Make a killer really wanna yap that kid
If he opens up his yap that's it




Mass of minerals in a glass house
Playing 4th the Wu neutrinos will blast out
Letting out verbal thunder bolts
Until the world attract old and younger folks
Charge with the vitality of magnetism
In large reality with massive rhythm
The manual without technical part
From the beginning give off an electrical spark


I respect you if you respect me
Everything's for real, WTC
No fake ass shit, don't front the Remy
Break bread, never have pockets empty
Let's get it, flip it up then we can spend it
The money train, Killa Beez on your brain
W's everywhere, one on your chain
Homeboys for life, please don't change
You can hide at my house, it ain't no thing
If you see the pigs, don't say jack
Call me original, don't say cap
I'm on the low, might be at the murder
Holding off the place y'all cats never heard of
Yeah, chicks wanna peep me out
Nasty ass, want me to pee in their mouth
But now I'm out, about to link with sticks




Bang a few notes up top, we call it beast mode
Forget the street codes, show you like a deep throat
It gets rougher, you suffer from the heat stroke
Blast barrels, embrace my leaf smoke
Park Hillians radio for back up
Polish your act up, nigga need a back up
Syrup in my cup, no cut, straight up
UG's on the court, never miss a lay up


When the emcees came to live out their names
Some rode the bus, some rode the train
Some motherfuckers wish they never came
When they met the nine swordsmen of Wu-Tang
Nine Maseratis pulls up to this party hard
Body, the party is filled with Godbody
There out of shape models coming through with those bottles
And double D's please, all eyes follow
Pass me a bucket of ice, that's nice
Hit with the vodka, what you say proper
I drink with the copper, show up in a chopper
Stop her, she wanna have a mnage  trois
I can tell by the bra, RZA Ra-KZA-Keem is all is Allah
Do you wish or wish upon a star? Do you wish or wish upon a star?






Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (roll it up niggas)
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (4:20, y'all, it's time, it's time)
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (it's been a long time for this man
Niggas been sleeping on the kid, man, everybody got some sideway shit to say)
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (Carlo! Know what I'm saying, man? Yeah)


Fast or slow mo, oh no, Meth done made a killing
Call the po-po, oh niggas is squealing, oh, y'all ain't feeling
Niggas no more, the bigger they are, harder they go though
Good pussy put a hump in my back like Quasimoto
Hah, my sex ain't homo, season vet, hold the adobo
Got rappers on that low carb diet, y'all can't get no dough
I keep a low pro, file, excuse me as I get smoked out
Put hands on these niggas, then put the roach out
Go head, I'm wishing you would, ask if it's good
Man, this Tarzan shit in the woods, my shit is hood, bitch
That means I'm hood rich, telling you lies
Straight out the pull-pit, it's like Merrill Lynch I'm on that bullshit
Real spit, money come first, and even worse
You need all your toes & fingers to count up what I'm worth, trick
So when I blow a smoke cloud in your face, just take a hint
Dick, you crowding my space, it's Mr. Meth, pa


It's 4:20, roll up, nigga getting smo-ked out
No seeds, California weed have you choked out
No doubt, roll up, which rims spoked out
4:20 mean either you roll up or roll out


Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it


So on and so on, I flow on
Power to our people, get your smoke on
And I'm so gone, off, that sour diesel
Hard to hold on, but hold on, it's like I'm Pretty Toney
With that robe on, got terrorist shook, because I'm so bomb
The hood, put, me in position, I'm in the kitchen
With that cook book, the service I'm giving, birds they vision
Not a good look, told ya my nigga, Tical deliver
Hook or crook, lots of asses to kick, wish I had a bigger foot
Yeah, taking it there, hating who care
Y'all stay out my mental, I got killas waiting in here
To get you, as I sharpen my pencils, tear apart instrumentals
Fuck it, y'all niggas is pussy, so is the dick that sent you
RZA, we done it again, Co-D occassion
Here's to short skirts and Ol' Dirt McGirt, okay, then
Let's get it popping, like it ain't nothing to get it popping
The big and rotten's the city, too good to be forgotten

 - 2X


The rap game won't like me
You can tell that a nigga is shiesty
If I die, my second born'll be like me
Slide dick to your wifey
Never know your baby boy just might be
Quick to rob a jack, he's so icey, stay dressed to kill
From the Hill, never ran, never will
Attitude, like, fuck you still, I see you missing the point
This is not a rap song, you get clapped on
Bullets break the bone, like the joint, call you out your name
Disrespect ya moms, spit on your dame
Go public, then, shit on your fame, you overlooking the fact
Where you from, is where we at
And y'all don't want no, parts, in that that
Caught your verse for sale, but real niggas don't shoot & tell
We'd rather do the time and rot in the cell


The inner outer state, bi-coastal smoker
Inhale, Cali piff with a swift of glaucoma
Black jeans, black Timbs, black Benz roaster
Smoke rise, out the sun roof when I roll up
Verrazano, with no relation to Gravano
Carlo, shots are hollow, still cop a bottle
And pour some out, moment of silence, then I swallow
I'm still alive, and still the sun'll come out tomorrow
Shine shine shine, and grind, cuz it's money on my mind
And I'm moving like my life is on the line
For the bullshit, I really got no time, a full clip
Really gon' let ya niggas know what's on my mind
When ya getting out of line, have them choppers lit up
You won't need a camera phone to get the picture
Chalk down, tape around, body bag zipped up
Carlo Verrazano, you can call me mister








The way of the samurai is found in death
Meditation of inevitable death should be performed daily
Every day, when one's body and mind are at peace
He should meditate up on being up to blocked
By arrows, rifles, spears and swords
Being carried away by surging waves
Being thrown in to the midst of a great fire
Being struck by a lightning, and shaken to death by a great earthquake
Falling from thousand foot cliffs, dying of a disease
Commiting seppiku at the death of one's master
In everyday when one fails, one should consider himself as dead
This is a substance of the way of a samurai


Nigga I don't wanna talk
I own one, ghost gun, briefcase in this equilibrium
It's the killa on your block, melodic flux
War flock, of perfected, dead it, bloods chop it up
And the birds of a feather, fly together
Intellaced moving mo' murder messages of me and Leatha Face
I'm your retainer, your perfect stranger
36th Chamber, Wu-Tang banga
I hit the dust and bust a straight no braina
Heavyweight gaina, and a lone blown ranger
Welcome to the world I rock
Doing what in the cut, while niggas know not
Grand theft, awaited with baited breath
Hear witnesses fear just as clear as death
In the twinklin of an eye, in the ways of the samurai
It's do or die, for the devil's pie
Now I'm phat broad down, received from mo' high
So beautiful it make you wanna cry, cry, cry
Power Equality, Ghost Dog
For Christ Bearer, Killa Bees, west coast God

Ah, designed to cause disaster, the mic blaster
Cause atoms to transfer, with immediate report for you bastards
I make minds stagger, with this North Star golden dagger
I self Lord and master, represented in this chapter
For you phony wild actors, I crack ya
For tryin to distract us, in the west
Transportin flows of energy in your chest
Over deep bass tones, in the flesh
Odd bones are rock clones
Repentance in the devil home cuz he divided the whole globe
Transform souls, told lies, we wrote scrolls
Now it's on, it's bid war
360 degrees that form the negative swarm
Born mentally and physically from the essence
Where North Star be flexin, questin, addressing
All minds that's hectic, no place to be
North Star trilogy, west coast Killa Bee
(Killa Who?) Killa Bee, (Killa Who?) Killa Bee
Killa Bee, (Killa Who?) Killa Bee

Choose the sword, and you will join me
Choose the ball, and you join your mother... in death
You don't understand my words, but you must choose
{*baby gurgling*}
So... come boy, choose life or death


The only man a ho wait for
Is the sky-blue Bally kid, in '83 rocked Tale Lords
My Memorex performed tape decks, my own Fostex
Watch out for Haiti bitches, I heard they throw hex
Yo, Wu whole platoon is filled with raccoons
Corner-sitting wine niggas sipping Apple Boone
This ain't no white cartoon
Cause I be ducking crazy spades
The kid hold white shit like blacks rock ashy legs
Why is the sky blue? Why is water wet?
Why did Judas rat to Romans while Jesus slept?
Stand up, you're out of luck like two dogs stuck
Ironman be sipping rum, out of Stanley Cups, unflammable
Noriega, aiming nozzles stay windy in Chicago
Spine-tingle, mind boggles
Kangols in rainbow colors, promoters try to hold dough
Give me mine before Po wrap you up in so-and-so
I ran the Dark Ages, Constantine the Great, Henry the 8th
Built with Genghis Khan, the red suede Wally Don


I judge wisely as if nothing ever surprise me
Lounging between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece is like building stones in Greece
Our poems are deep, from ancient tomes I speak
I'm overwhelmed as my mind roams the realm
My eye's the visions, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above cloud
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fit
I leave them split like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips


Aiyo, camouflage chameleon, ninjas scaling your building
No time to grab the gun, they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent from the President to raid your residence
Because you had secret evidence and documents
On how they raped the continents and lynched the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew
The year 2002 the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Unloyal snakes get thrown in boiling lakes of hot oil
Up boils your skin, chickenheads getting slim like Olive Oyl
Only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential vitamin and minerals
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffing clouds inside my pillow
Rolling with the Lamb, Twelve Tribes a 144, 000 chosen
Protons Electrons Always Cause Explosions


The banks a G, all CREAM downs a bet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax-free shit by any means
Whether bounty-hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such swift cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like ham
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the length one-tenth
Woofers thump, tweeters hiss like air pumps
RZA shaved the track, niggas caught razor bumps
Scarred trying to figure who invented
These unprecedented, opium-scented, dark-tinted
Now watch me blow him out his shoes without clues
Cause I won't hesitate to detonate, I'm short fused




Sup this is the Gravedigga jam session (add a little riff)
What's today's date? (Today's the 20th) (Friday)
The 20th of May, 1994
We chillin in GLC studios
And we gonna go like this
Got my man BB Frukwan (look at the riff)

Hook:
G-to-the-R-to-the-A-to-the-V
E-to-the-D-to-the-I-to-the-G
G-to-the-A-to-the-zig-zag-Z
Gravedigga, nigga, 6 feet deep
(x2)

Verse One: Grymreaper
I floss my teeth on a gospel track
I'm not an apostle, but I bring the axe to ya back
I chew and attack
Like Crest on plaque
After that, your world is black
You drop into a hole
Your mold separates from your soul
Behold, the Gravediggaz told you 'Beware'
But you didn't listen
So now we appear eardrums glisten, ha ha

Hook

Verse Two: Gatekeeper
When I wreck I commence to detect
Ready to dissect so come step alive and die
Next murder is mayhem
Diggin graves is a regular
Treach-orous mangler
Tha Boston Strangler
Heated and trapped in a fury of hate
Daredevil, the rhyme rebel my art terminates
Subduin and pul-ver-i-zin ya head
You bled, fell dead, and your tomb-stone read
Rza-to-the-recta, Grym-to-the-reap
Unda-to-the-taker, Gate-to-the-keep
Creepin thru tha ghettos and the slums and streets
Gravedigga, nigga, 6 feet

Verse Three: Rzarector
Darkness shall fall upon y'all
Who slept on the styles
That crept thru tha door
The grave, behave, we come to save
So don't be afraid of the dark
We spark like light in night
Excite, excite is right, is right
Come follow the light
And see what I see and be what I be
Tha G-to-the-R-to-the-A-to-the-V...E

Hook

Verse Four: Gatekeeper
In the mind I come with the sparks from the attic
Yet psychopathic brain tracks is tragic
Twist lifting wrist like riff of a Taurus
Deep in tha forest, I slay for tha porridge
Yet it's cold, ya die slow like a tortoise
Deep in my chorus, ya result Diggamortis
Let me see I'm castin disease
Contrary, yet some fairy cause ya bleed

Hook

Verse Five: Rzarector
Demonic, the sonnet is bangin like chronic
And niggas be audi faster than Sonic
Bubonic, plutonic ya best up on it
Beats bein programmed ASR Ensoniq
Styles compiled for miles and childs
Bodies in aisles and upside-down smiles
Reflect, catch wreck from sun-moon sect
Revenants shines light then thought reflects

Hook

Verse Six: Grymreaper
I came on the scene
In a wheel that Ezekiel seen
To exploit your flaws like Philistines
Look in the sky, oh my, it is I
No alibi, so don't even try to feed me swine
And Grymreaper's mind is so refined
I'm deep, I'm deep, I'm deep
As a hill or a cliff or a steep
Incline at the bottom of an ocean reef



Spoken word sample: I wish my dreams were as serene!

All we'd do
That's all we knew
You know it's true

What could we do with what we blew
There's just one move through time

Spoken word sample: It is always up there, high in the sky. Those who were there are somehow above and beyond vengeance and temptations

Spoken word sample: My eyes touched the sky!




Yeah, start wit that one
Yo, yo, yo


My acoustic pugilistic lingustic rap fabric
Is a mixture of Arabic, Sanscrit, English, italics
I talk quick, y'all bitches can't comprehend my dick release spit
But love should I release hits
We travel through bodies like blood vessels
While y'all crab niggas try to wrestle to be on top of this pedestal
Slang doctrine, minoxin, lyrical toxin, I'm chessboxin
Words is rushin through like a herd of angry oxen


Fatal for these pussy cat niggas is dead weight
Concentrate, my murder rate excellerate, terminate
So spoil like coke in the foil
Knock knock, I shot the whole block
Electricity, flow splendidly
Internally inside of me like Tony Starks tee
I create excellency, one-sixty call L-O-U-N-G assist me
Papi wardrobe is key, roll promptly
For slang hall, vocabulary Igor, Frankenstein mind
Rewind for a minute while I dig down your track, stupid
I move quick shit is accurate, Kojack tactics
Chaos, killa bee minds, high society blackness, spread the rumor


My lyrical marvel makin more cream than Carvel
Y'all niggas best to hold your weight like barbell
To my verbal swordsman school, students don't play truant
My most prudent pupil, rhyme under influence
Of alcohol and tobacco, mushrooms imported from Morocco
Bellies on the rocks and a twenty sack of choco
With forty tales and gold around the fist, bitch I carve
Lyrics on the paper so my family won't starve


I'm deep in the shit, I stay highly involved
Never in-conceited, never been beated
Been trapped in many wars but not yet retreated
My style you need it, I just write to read it
It's all fresh lyric, no nothing gets repeated
I came a long way and guess what, I succeeded
I conquer my opponent and feed him baby food
'Cause he's childish and illiterate and ye has been rude
To the father year me, O-R-I-G
Respond to the war with the Killa Bee law


Scavenger nigga, you's a shrimp
A full line of shit, my ear can digest it
Stop drinking all that water, let's take it to the land
So I can Godzilla up your shit mister Tiny Tim man
Niggas be creeping up my beanstalk
When I start to come down on your fucking ass
You tried to chop shit on up
Played my shit like parks bitch, I'm that


Legendary microphone's weaponry
You secondary bitch ass fairies
Scary cats won't survive this verbal attack
You think you're slang can match
The Wu-Tang, emphatically now cypher
You fake crumbs, you should be stung on your tongue
While you young guns bunge, we plunge into the grunge
Deep into the dark dungeon, we come in one wind
Nine minds combine to form the wisest rhyme force to summon
I be the quoted mathematical combination
Unloading mysteries of life, you feel my solar wind blowing


Just then, I came on the stage like wind
Blew slang in your face and it touch your skin
You felt chilly, just like you smoked a bag of illy
You need a coat just to protect your throat
Two pairs of socks, kid I'm cold like ice rocks
Chap-lipped duds can't fuck with the chatterbox
Cherry heads felt the draft of the ox
Shaolin niggas all fuck with one block..
They forgot about the big Cappa slang murderer
Down with the union big street sling murderer
Terrorizing, move I'm tranquilizing
Fast getaway wit the slow speed driving
Two miles an hour, Cappa do it wit the power
Somebody blow something, cut fool in the tower




Yo! It's the burial ground sound, Dunn!
It's real out here
Staten Island puttin chills in y'all niggas
Forever in it.. yo


My devastating hot '97 mentality
Keep me on point for my four-digit salary
Heavyweight lyric never lost one calorie
I'm soon to be seen on the TV screen
Gambino Cappaccino to the Afro Sheen
Stay black, where I'm at, high road to rap council
Splash love to Wu in a orderly tonsil
Never limit to the diction, cause chaos to mixin
Brutalize a sound check, ripple through the intermission
Rap's under siege, held tight like a squeeze
Forced in the world 'Donna nuclear freeze
Doing damage to the wannabe Flip Mode and Def Squad
Ruckus a whirlpool in the rap entourage
If you dare to test thirty-six, chambers of strangers
Not word of mouth, or song, real wigs might peel
Livin large and in charge branch out Bon Voyage
Twenty-four diamond government named God
Alias Daryl Hill bring thugs back to kill
Circle around my son, Daryl Jr. never eatin lard
Auntie Dauntie sixteen holdin me down
AIDS of rap music may be contagious to sound
Verbal the slang pushed back to create pronoun
Method forcin J-Love to Bring the Pain from underground
Realizin food for thought is self-compromising
Shaolin cut the crack into a triple-O sizin
Blue do what he do to keep that currency risin
Hopin I catch a deal so we can catch a four-wheel
Instead of catchin bodies, niggas not keepin it real
I dirt bomb niggas that steal cake from stores
That's my type of niggas I be wanting on my tours
Can't help it, my styles stay fat like Roseanne
Ruckus in the square I stay rough like the Clan
Panther on my arm, pen and pad in my hand
Punk motherfuckers better beware of the Shaolin
Defy interactive project Children of the Corn
Gats on my man keep em bustin till ya gone
Style so ancient it sparks just like the unicorn
Donna come through everyday my uniform
Changes and switches, I came to make ladies out of bitches
Crackhead niggas get stitches
So what up with that kid, danger when I attack, kid
Watch how the slang hits you just like a bat, kid
Form another pyramid, look how we slid
All over Park Hill, Stapleton politic
On a twenty dollar bill all in it together
You can't fuck with the stormy weather, yaknahmean?


To the year Born God all the Gods strike hard
Fast from the swine hold down your boulevard
Father-U the C-Cipher, start the revolution
Middle finger in the air, for slang prostitution

Yo 5x
Ima keep it short for you short minded niggas
Straight up

(LZA Verse 1)
Peace after Revolution
Ascension to Evolution
Meditation and concentration
I'm never waiting I stay waken
Left brain penetrating: right brain is my representation
You hesitating you feather weighting I'm levitating
Through the pressure
Crystal line efforts
I'm christ like the sunny weather
Congratulations on your effort
But you made it this far
Just to fall so short
Life is but a sport
I'm tired of preaching my voice is getting very hoarse
Now I'm riding on a horse
Enter the horizon
Wavy baby like I'm the sun of Poseidon
Before you go to sleep an imagine a red light trident
It'll open the door to the highest I promise but don't call me Negrodamus
And then I woke up on a beach with the sand between my feet
With some veggies and fruits to eat
Damn this shit is sweet
Nigga smoking on DMT you couldn't see the 3
& 7 planes left motherfucker
Whoo!

Runaway

Runaway(GOAT)
Runaway
To make a way

(ILLA Verse 1)
Mastering life is all about mastering skill
Master your ILL
Don't let the Matrix-reality distract you
Keep you still
Cause trying to move paralyzed by the dimensions in your mind
Will self destruct your build
For real
An all my Negus' know the deal
Holy Grail; Waves in my Cup Runneth Over
This smart water distilled
Holy Mackerel this wholesale!?
God's dope is never fish scaled
An I know
At times what i speak may seem insane but to sane
I'm that thin line in-between
So therefore pay attention to this free common sense
Like Mark Twain
This energy speaking to all inner-chi
So gain
The powers that be
Love for everyone we must obtain
This is an omnipotent game going on in the universes brain
An this Uni-verse I recite is the GLO
Rise & Shine from the pain
No ceiling to my reign; I grind like Dwayne
Carter; but I'm HOV in my lane
Oprah see my color purple circle
Own'n my name
Network it the same
Marzsoul ILLA As-salam by the way
An I know
The flows get silly like V.I.C
Swag knocking ladies out Layla Ali
I know I goes off every line like the handwriting bad
Therefore; ladies put it on me like I am TAB
Every mama love the D like Moesha dad
Oh! contradicted thyself
Jaleel did i do that?
I spit crack
Rap tight
An supply y'all with hefty bags
Full of that good full of that good
Bet them birds saying "You'll never make it"
Later tweeting "Knew you would"
I know them terribly bad bitches gon need some Soul
Want some Good
But dem like buffets an I chef private
So for dem me don't cook
This the Alchemic culinary book
Mastered like my mathematics that rule
11-22-33
Uh even as Michael
If you feel the truth I'm
Moon Walking on the Sun as I'm playing it Cool

 Ya know what I mean?
 GHOST-FACE KILLAH!
 Lemme give y'all the bullshit hook for y'all niggas
Check it out...


The burners and the stash, we 'bout the cash
We got females that got it like that
The golden childs that bone the crowd
See, niggas in the place that bit my style
Well, I'm a singer, dancer, we bulletproof brothers
Wu-Tang got the answer
Cause if I had a chance to do it again
I will still keep the heat in my pants-uh


Y'all be nice to the crackheads, everybody listen up
I shot one of my bitches, the ho ain't trick enough
Word life to big screen Don, tapping dustbones out
With starwriters like I fucked Celine Dion
Stuck everything that's the god's honest beyond
We airin' niggas out, that's the type shit that we on
Official Wu-Tang headbanger
Flood your space with big waves like you did in Sri Lanka


I drink heavy gallons of cru, play the big part
Niggas got squid on the grill, selling kids Clarks
Finesse notes, yo, the Guess on with the vest pose
Yellow swede one matching hat with the grey gun
Niggas be rhymin' for nothing, then my team pull up
We all throw down y'all broke niggas stay frontin'
Lines come digital stupid, plus ain't got no jewelry on
Bet I'm still live and I'm coopin'
Two of my silverbacks run through a pack of your wolves
Front on react, we're sippin' Cognac  relax dude
Know I'm with these cracks dude


Yo, 1-2, Dirt McGirt
Solid tone smith with 6th shots, lick shots
Leave your head like a Shaolin monk with 6 dots
Brooklyn Zoo, Zoo
Brooklyn Zoo


It's the return of Bin Laden, grab your armor
Smash pretty boy niggas, crush their karma
Eat bones with alligators, roll deep with my entourage
My whole crew's fresh out the bars
Diggler AKA the Cab Driver
Drop him off in the middle of fire
Dirty Island, drag bodies to the Murderland
Knock niggas out hurtin' my hand


I remember in the elevator we was playin' corners
Now we play the corners and the cops is stayin' on us
Staten's where the war is
Where the court system's running out of warrants
Where TNT be jumping out the Taurus
For real I can't call it
You see I love Lucy cause she Lawless
Exactly like that 1-0-3-0-4 is
Snitch niggas swallow your tongue
Already know the island I'm from
And y'all don't want no problems with them


We got a history full of lightning victories
Conceptual breakthrough, it ain't no mystery
Long vision from giants in every way
Rap czars, magnificent flows for every day
From the East to the 'ville, from the West to the hills
Incredible rhymes, encouraging skills
From rat packs, the smallest crews were enormous
We hit 'em fast with an effortless performance
MCs start fleeing in flocks
Especially those that's more sensitive to heat and shock


We grindin' down to the bone, my name grounded in stone
I'm Mr. Violence we loungin' with chrome
Mr. Violence we lounge in his home, hit the housing on Rome
Shining like a hundred thousand in stones
Move mountains with poems, got a jones for dinero
1-6-zero my songs we throwin' elbows
The hoes cling, sho thing, we know kings
Only dime dikes with minds right, we choose Queens


Yeah, we wild like rockstars who smash guitars
Yo son split his face with the toast, he ain't ghost
It's no joke iron coat rifle with the stroke
One toke brains float, shot to the throat
Before the smoke hit, witness the killing, chilling crime scene
Body on the block, eyes open from the shock
Of being popped in the neck
Yet he still held a lit cigarette between his fingers
Danger when you step into the chamber with the Masta
Disaster, gotta blast ya cause I have to


The rat pack is back from the island of Stat'
Leave you cursed dust, cause you worship the Gat
The first one to snap drunk off the Smirnoff
Blow the bouncer's ear off, let him floss he the boss
Handcuffed, to the turntables like Wizard Theodore
See it's pure, let it rain pearly ounces
Bang him with the thing that hang from the trousers
You don't want no drama, I'm flaming fast
That nigga jumped up and did the Damon Dash





Rappers seem like they need a steering wheel to handle hoes
She seen the banana was too quick to give me cantaloupe
D Money and Worm we sit around smoking Amoco
If I was violent my shooters Steph Curry, yours Plaxico
You can't handle the truth? Hip Hop demanding hope
When others rappers drop, it's like they cannot handle soap no homo
You hear me spit, you watching Lebron work
Chicago seen more white girl than a Hannah Montana concert
Verbal assault got pussy niggas beyond hurt
The game in a submission, working angles, I'm beyond Kurt
Been next, fuck a bitch at my neck for sex nigga
Leave shorty standing in the rain like Jody did Yvette nigga
Going macadamian, it ain't me when they asking who sane
Mindset is Hussein. Word is bond, a phenomenon
I make niggas give up rapping likes it Ramadan
Spit like I'm trying to live grand, like your momma mom
Damn, for that life I been patient
While y'all still ain't realized dickriding ain't no form of transportation
I'm in the lab bakin' while you cakin', so ill I need a patent
Got passion, dreamin' impregnatin' Paula Patton
Picture pure rapping without a caption, I ain't acting
Moving like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin
Nas line, checking for fucks to give and I ain't got one
Fuck with me? That's Russian roulette with a sawed off shotgun
Meek say "When you broke as a joke, ain't shit funny."
Dummy I'm humble, but convinced I'll give Cole a run for his money
Been treated right by people I thought thought nothing of me
And fucked over by posers who I thought truly loved me
My heart been through it believe me
Don't bang, but the money stackin like its GD
Type of shit you couldn't copy off CD or DVD
City of BDs MOEs, VLs or BP
SN, must I begin?
On how my generation, so filled with sin?
And how fake shit is relatable, like it's they kin?
Leaving niggas in the street how Peter Parker found Uncle Ben
Damn, everyday life in Gotham
Going through these lines sorta like a slalom
Enemies words? I never forgot em
I just proved em wrong and sorted they losses into rows and columns
In y'all pain I find asylum
Fuck designer and these grown man whiners
Who would've thought a dark skinned prince would be the most shinin' diamond
Not easy to find when everyone wanna be a savage
Let us admire you green with envy as I chase after cabbage
Don't think they reminisce over you when you average
Baby deep down I'm just wondering Candice
Johnson have you orgasm and throbbing?
Riding, doggy, you got so many options
Pole is on the spot that next man gon be toppin
Cause I'm passing her off like John Stockton
You couldn't test me with a proctor or nearby doctor
Lyrics dope, notepad got pot like Betty Crocker
Doing big things, when I'm around, they acknowledge my presence
You do big things like you just got precious pregnant
The greatest, nothing more or less, here's a lesson
If Gs move in silence, then why these niggas detected?
Ain't hawaiian, but told some bitches mahalo
Young nigga from Chicago with a flow, tell him bravo
No lube for fucking the game raw twice
Your girl pussy my nine to five, I stick to my day job all night
Bust in her eyes, so she see where I'm coming from right?
Giving a different meaning to smashing on sight
I only let niggas sit in the throne to keep it warm for me
Groupie for the band so I let her hold the horn for me
On occasion I'm faded, but I ain't never been mistaken
It's always been the greats I've emulated
And painted my own pictures, never fake to my own niggas
Dickriders hop on a track, ride the wave with the on nigga
Labels think they own niggas
On my own nigga, ironic, since the word was born when Europeans was proud to own niggas
And let me be clear that I'm far from racist
But the power of a certain persuasion? Shit amazing
You feared for your life? Not a slap on your wrist
Increase the melanin, they'd be sicking dogs on my kids nigga




Yo, this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
For all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it

Yo, in the housing, thousands seen early graves
Victims of worldly ways, memories stays engraved
All my live brothers, is locked down with high numbers
The young hunger, blind to these lies, they die younger
In this New World the Order slaughter men, women, and children
Ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in
The projects, lifeless like a vietnam vet
Constant war, sever threats of enemy conquest
Crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble
Streets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble
Vivid thoughts, Devils resort to trick knowledge
They kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars
I know the pain the game bring, I did the same thing
Spaced out in the staircase, performing a sting
It's hard to keep control, I bless those who seek a scroll
Trying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
Not a role model, I walk a hard road to follow
I sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
The gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole
Mentally they fold, and they eventually sold
Their life and times, deadly like the virus design
But too, minute to dilute, the scientist mind


You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way


A voice cries from the wilderness of the North
A representation of the families that lost one
All victims of incarceration
Or other divisions of the family structure
Youths are injected with serums that leads
To skin irritations, babies being born with
Disfigurations, experimentations
On their faces there bear worry-ations
Of mothers that carry the pain
Of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
Fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
It lightly begins to rain screams of terror
Are hidden by the passing trains
This can't be little Hussein, his uncle cried
As he drops to his nephew's side, holding his cane
Just give me a name, of who has inflicted this
Bitter sickness, and left us to witness


Yeah, yo
Curses from war, innocent blood spills for days
Soothe in godly ways, hands, solemn in praise
Tree of life, more precious than rubies, golden game
The wise shall flourish inherit, Halls of Fame
Crime visions in my blood got me, locked in prison
While we die hard living people whine about religion, vision
Blow, spin, and sin and killing what's revealing
It's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen
Zero process, progress, become the hunted
America's most wanted, good life flaunted, want it
Some love the speed, some satisfy a need
Some want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed
The strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed
One flew astray, and it caught my little seed
Can it be, the ice savage, trife life, made me grab the knife
The righteous man was beat with many stripes, pipes
Take in my energy, breath and know the rest
Cause the good die young and the hard die best


You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way


Y'all bitches love dances, and pulling down your pants
While your man's on tour, your spending up his advances
Your friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke, and suck dick
The whole projects is trapped in stench
You either high school drop-outs, one to three cop-outs
Fifteen years old, shorty ass and top out
Ninety-nine cent beer drinking pussy stinking
Fucking so much your ass and titties start shrinking
New World Order slave trade, minimum wage, Medicaid
Can a devil fool a Muslim nowadays
Inside my lab, I'm going mad
Took two drags off the blunts, and started breaking down the flag
The blue is for the Crips, the red is for the Bloods
The whites for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs
Or the slugs that ignites, through the night, by the dawn
Early light, why is sons fighting for the stripe


As we dwell through this concrete hell, calling it home
Mama say, take your time young man and build your own
Don't wind up like your old dad
Still searching for them glory days he never had
So many bad want to scheme for American dream, no more kings
The cash rule everything now, we going down
These babies looking up to us, it's up to us
The Million Man March MC's, get on the bus
But envy, greed, lust, and hate, separate
Though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
No longer, brothers, we unstable
Like Kane when he slew Abel, killing each other


You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way




Wake up... wake up
Wake up...


Wake up, get a hold of your life, go get your cake up
The motto in the streets is you eat, or you get ate up
Straight up, you tired of waiting, go get your weight up
My peoples tired of waiting for reparations to pay us
Screaming Jesus can save us, I, I get the Bentley if I save up
But that's just another trick to enslave us
Push the minimum wages
Put, put our fathers up in them cages
Then watch out when mother struggled to raise us
But, but my ambition won't let me live in this poor condition
That doesn't care about color, creed, or your religion
Priests, politicians gotta listen to opposition
From my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in
From my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in


Allah said to save the babies from the cold
Pour wisdom in the cup so the truth overflows
Still, knowledge is that bread that keeps us well-fed
Old time religion will not bring us satisfaction
Without action now who can disagree with me?
God is not a mystery, there's nowhere in history
That you could show and prove to me
But still you face east and nod your head to me religiously
I'm G-O-D, to infinity, for real


The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me


Poor reparations, the Bush administration
Unequality, martial law, segregation
False hood, false teaching, false education
Now's the time for us to come amongst this nation
They deceiving us, they don't believe in us
They believe in that Cream like Julius Caesar
I'm like Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X with the heaters
Ripping the chains of the remains of all of the leaders
Never worship the image of evil swine eaters
I'm on the back of the bus with two fine divas
We in the jungle of life, but never jungle fever
I'm God-body all day long, spiritual life lessons
That I recite in this song
Trying to wake up everybody, can't we all get along?
For all my people that's out there persevering through the storm
Black fist, Staten Island, stand up, stand strong
Penetrate through the gate and bring the Clan along


The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me


Wake up and realise the times
That we living in the world is getting more iller than ever
Thought we was chillin', striving change for the better
But it was a dream like Martin Luther
He had a vision that could move a mountain
Protect one another, that's world to my brother Malcolm
As-salamu alaykum, alaykum as-salam
We want justice, police supposed to protect and serve
And then they shoot us down like wild animals
The nerve of them cold-hearted killers
With blue suits slaying our black youth
The earth cries from all the blood that's being spilled
We need a solution fast, get InshAllah bill
Let me educate them, translate it meaning God's will
It goes all in together, together how we are
To stand with a plan, provided we down to fall
And that's the Willie Lynch tactics that separated the masses
Taught us all to think backwards




The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me

We gonna change the world (x5)




Aiyo, slipperly slurp slip, nigga, churped off, two sniffs of cocaine
This motherfucker broke the glass in my whip
Try'nna dip, on this twenty dollar bill I had on my dashboard
And police is asking me son, why I whoop his ass for
Save y'all two hours of paperwork, my neighbor lurk
Watchdog, chew ass out, son, and put in major work
We collect antique ammunitions, and plus
We got them big guns, you only see in science fictions
My Uncle Cuffie's the chief, but my little, knucklehead
Cousin Mar', yeah, son, is a thief
And we gave him a job, making three hundred a week
But he slipped on my piece, now he's back in the streets


How many times have you let your tongue go slip
From the grin in your teeth and the cracks of your lips
I never heard such nerve before
But you better spill slowly through the cracks of my pores
Just to please you honey, just to please you honey
And how many times have you let your tongue go slip
From the grin in your teeth and the cracks of your lips


A.G. is King like Tutankhamen or Haile Selassie
Body the party, watchin' for niggas tryin' to Pac me
Or Biggie Smalls me, come on, please
With these gemstars, I'm Jason Vorhees
A's loose, so much pain inflicted, remain addicted
Carry microphones, with the Passion of Je-sus
It's Flamboyant for life, nigga, throw those L's up
Ain't millionaires, by this year, then catch us in 12 months
Now who's fuckin' with Andre?
A beast on the east, love on the west, ask Kanye
Still Diggin' motherfucker, it's that plain and simple
G.D. til' my heart beat,discontinue
On the ave., til every soul in the ghetto is gone
Where niggas sell more rock than heavy metal songs
Anything you want to know, then read E2K
Fuck with A, and get broke up like B2K, cuz..




Aiyo, aiyo, cuz I'm the piece, the magnetic, I'm not the weak and pathetic
Sometimes, inside my rhymes, you hear words that perfected
Master your Hung Gar, five animal form kung fu
Thundar the Barbarian sword, being swung
Wu-Tang, invincible blade, thrust to parry
Up the Temple steps, much water got carried
In this industrious world, meet the illustrious
Uncombustional, give props like Doctor Huxtable
Knew many men, only trust a few
Women, love the few, mention Wu-Wear linen, rugged blue
God-U's, I tuck a few, known to smash out a club or two
And represent the worldwide W




Oh, oh, your veins, may call, in sweat, for blood
Your veins, may call, in sweat, for blood
Your veins, may call, in sweat, for blood
Feed you the flesh of men, so you can see end again
Yeah, yeah...



"I wanna stay with you, forever"


Yo, yo, the A-1 sauce, the Divine Force
My mind blind force is known to blow time off course
Even, if I rode around the world on a blind horse
Strapped down, I'd still get my point across
Allah is father of all
You debate whether big, whether small
Whether short, whether tall
Whether dense, whether length
Whether strength, whether width
Either man, animal, bird or fish
Whether, black or white, more shapes than snowflakes
Existin', everywhere but you still can't locate
The man of steel couldn't bend me
Time couldn't end me
Even the great devil Satan that tried to befriend me
Understand the equality, God in a bodily
Form, lettin' my knowledge be born
Lettin' my knowledge be born...

"I wanna stay with you, forever"


Yo, yo, yo
I be the fatal flyin', I'm like NATO flyin'
Over your country and droppin' down forty tons of iron
Filled with explosives, your chance is hopeless
We have your head poppin' up like the blowfish
I'm not talkin' Hootie, nigga pass the zootie
I could bag the cootie, maybe smoke the ootie
The runaway train with no track
I got the heart of Faye Dunaway whippin' that child with the coatrack
T.V. droppin' bombs or droppin' germs
Baby moms in the courthouse, she's droppin' terms
Guns go off, bustin' all directions
D.J. choose, another fuckin' dope selection

"...with you forever..."
"Like the corners of my mind...."
"I wanna stay with you, forever"


Yo, the pen is mightier than the sword, as I face my worldly challenge
In the scale of justice and my heart remains balanced and neutral
My respect for all men is mutual
As my thoughts surpass a level to which you devils compute to
You've been given the chance to hear the true and living
So do the knowledge, son, before you do the wisdom
So you can understand, how the thunder and
Lighting above your head is caused by the Son of Man
We experimentin' with high explosions
That cause the place to quake and the surface erosions
The earth produce lava like the mouth produce saliva
This wisdom goes deeper than your scuba diver
In search for the pearl jewels sold to Tiffany
My verbal heart symphony will strike the epiphany
Insight, ignite, and then men might, see love and hell
Hell and right, then excel, to be masters of your circumference
First, by obtainin' mastery of your common sense
This supreme wisdom clears a man's vision
You can see it through the lies and the fantism
Of the equivocal, two-faced political individual
Who's only out for residual, fabricatin' lies
To eradicate the wise
But we come to civilize and gravitate to the skies
Of the heavenly celestial sphere
Trust me, son, it's dear, in between your ears


A day to God is a thousand years
Men walk around with a thousand fears
The true joy of love bring a thousand tears
In the world of desire, there's a thousand snares

"I wanna stay with you forever" 



"I wanna stay with you, forever"

Yeah, yeah, a special guest appearance
From the slums.... yo, aiyo


I examine your diameter, third eye light the camera up
Be careful, I got four ninjas, inside your parameter
Perimeter, flame burst out all sides like Gamora
My poisonous is released, gas from the canister
Raise the black fist, we keep the earth on it's axis
I make a good day move slow like molasses
Welcome to the bee hive, dual processor with the G5
There's not a tape or disco break I can't revive
In this high tech world of fire wire and microchip
We still keep the four-five clip, filled with the spiral tip


I come from the 36 Chambers of danger
With many lyrical swordsmen, that quick to change ya
The difficulty to see closely, is mostly
It's a critical point, when ya rap niggas approach me
Like the blind, deaf, dumb, who mind was left numb
A non B-Boy nigga, couldn't rhyme to the drum
When I started M.C.'ing I entered, the gates of pleasure
Not knowing, I be coming with, too much to measure
With the math of an elder, and the steel of a welder
The path of tray, that I had laid down, to held a
Blueprint, that would draw attention like the Pope
I examine all with the internal mirror of the scope


Supreme deluxe edition, CREAM with a touch of wisdom
Beams that through up the system, spleens, I conduct, you listen
How you gonna tell me no, yo, the fuck you is in
Locked in a four block radius like a public prison
Twenty two year old, dunn, ain't got a cup to piss in
But he got a barrel gun, and that's knuckle twitching
And he got a baby moms and a cousin bitching
Went to catch a body, now he stuck in another prison


When you see it, you better acknowledge, your all swords
Blaze the green hundred fours
Pull out on you, blew you for the cause
And Sudan outst a nigga, seclude you from my Clan
This is water Glock, aces on cameras sniffin' raw
Why try to fuck with these lecturers
I'm so high powered, my electrical structure blew down the floor
You was king for a second, I reigned, came with a different name
The W.T.C. Family and more, one!


They applause when I make my entrance
I move on 'em with age and experience, before I start the sentence
The rhyme was designed to meet most demand
Is enough to compensate, fertilize the land
He blew out the belt drive, M.C.'s they felt vibes
Powerful dart, narrowly missing your whole tribe
Scientists look, at the magnitude and devastation
But the strands of heavy metal seem to have no relation
But it's always potential for large scale disasters
Because the instrumentals, spins a hundred times faster
Many was taken, is at the price of a pawn
And the collective lost had left, thousand of mourn
Them Clansmen, are the nucleus of hip-hop
There's no room for error, M.C.'s will get dropped
Evidence of terrifying threats from heat pressure
Power by strong winds that blew rhymes off the dresser
The words spread through the town from Yonkers to Leffers
And to kill off the slang was a city wide effort
But they couldn't be more wrong, my click was all strong
Fit together seamlessly, til you're all gone


The queen by far, is the strongest piece
Should too, should not be prematurely brought
Into play, during in the opening
Or she will be attacked by wicked pieces
And driven back, it is very dangerous
To make a raid with the queen early on in the game
It is best, in opening, to make but one move with the queen
And that, to a square where she is not exposed
To any direct or indirect attack



Looked dead, didn't I?
Well I wasn't
But it wasn't for lack of trying, I can tell you that
Actually Bill's last bullet put me in a coma
A coma I was to lie in for five years
When I woke up, I went on what the movie advertisements refer to as a Roaring Rampage of Revenge
I roarded, and I rampaged, and I got bloody satisfaction
In all, I've killed 33 people to get to this point right now
I have only one more
The last one
The one I'm driving to right now
The only one left
And when I arrive at my destination...
...I'm gonna kill Bill




My pop said
I was addicted to the music

That's the water
Word to Mick
No use trying to dilute it

I could push white
Like daisies
Chase pink like tulips

But I rather compose
And sing songs from my two lips

I've got no use for substances
But I see people abuse em

My aunty on crack
My uncle strung on this liquor

Floating through his life
With his feet near the ceiling

But the homie stressed out
Cause he living near the killings

Son became a product

Brother died from dealing

But it's better to have him drunk
Than have him stealing

Or feeling Women and children
Like the sickos on the news

I caught this teacher dude
Getting brain after school

Ol' girl was failing class
Until she did the extra credit

And now her ass sag
Because she's pregnant

Thank god it ain't mine
Cause I've been hitting too

But when they throw it at you
It ain't shit you can do

What you expect
The media's been riddled with sex

And she needs to escape
From the pain and the stress

But she doesn't understand
Her actions are making it worse

She doesn't have the type of attitude
That would let her discourse

Ever since she was little
Her parents have been divorced

And she doesn't have the courage
To let them know it hurts

So she been living life on her own
With no regrets

No parental advisory
And no safety with the sex

But her boyfriend gang affiliated
And she feels safety with the set

But they share the same goal
And she ain't safe yet

Now she feels used and abused
They were looking for something

She won't let it get worse
She ain't looking for comfort

She's looking for freedom
Found 44 cals
Now she's longer breathing

The Underground EP
Derelict Theme


I damage your neck
With the butt of the tech
Vandalous sex
Cuttin' you ear to ear
With the razor of my Gillette
You couldn't get respect
If you was a captain or a cadet
Granddaddy, daddy, or uncle who's a Vietnam vet
I'll battle you 50 deep
Solo artist shocker dead beat
Derelicts on the loose
Wylin' like thugs outta prison with slugs
While y'all start screaming
Like grasses in a submission
(Lay down your pot to piss in)
Blow up the house you live in
Believe me, we greedy
And often you is easy
Your whole album cheesy
Because you got platinum artists on it
Don't make it hot
We steamroll with real niggas
And that's something that you not
I'm vampin what you got
Then setting up camp at your spot
Foiling your plot
Every rhyme that you jot
I rock to the six like musty twat
A dead corpses that been cut up
And left in abandoned lots
Ya, derelicts theme
Comparing your team
To ours is a fucked up dream
The shit I done seen
Has turned me to a scandalous fiend
Sticking your peeps for cream
Gators or boots, nigga, I'm crushing your dreams
As foul as it seems
Dismantling spleens til your whole clique's
Walking funny like handicapped juggling teams
I rumble with kings
More humble with seen
Until it's time for me to kill again
Sincerely yours, the Kon Artis


Ay yo
Competition of none's such
Derelicts the one must
Let the guns bust
Brigade one trust
Untouched
Martyr a mic
Slaughter your life
Runnin avenue soldiers bitch
It's water and trife
Competition ain't none such
Derelicts the one must
Let the guns bust
It's Brigade one trust
Untouched
Martyr a mic
Slaughter your life
Runnin' avenue soldiers bitch
Smarter and trife


Who's the fat bastard
Rapping that mo' master
Snorting coke that's whiter than Casper
Better run faster
I can out-smoke all of you motherfuckers
And bitch I was born with asthma
Fuck life, I'd rather track Jack Daniels
Smoke weed and rape Cockerspaniels
A peeping Tom, nigga I need Ridalin
Fuck girls
Bitch I only date senior citizens
Your grandma, nigga I'm the one that vic'd her
Next time you rush me
You better be a little bit quicker
Run your streets in the house
And make full of malt liquor
I'm lettin' you throw the first blow
And bring ten of your toughest niggas
End ya year
Like the last day of December
(But did you rape that bitch?)
I was so drunk I can't remember
I used to be in a group
We had an argument who was the hottest
Now both them niggas is dead
And I roll as a solo artist

Chorus


Look bitch you stressed out
I divide these bullets equally among your crew
And give you five so you don't feel left out
Like red the hammer
I'm nailing niggas in they spleens
Just to make walking again a sympathetic dream
Energetic schemes
Rap vandal and dismantle
Tackle MC's and wax you
Like your rap name was Candle
Grabbing a mic with no handles
Leaving you dusty
Like walking the desert in old sandals
If you weeded or drunk
Keep your heat in your trunk
We beat you to lumps
Swell you up with permanent mumps
We dangerous playa
Cuffin' my chews
Spittin the phlegm out
Getting at you whether you coming out
Or you been out
You never exempt
From this murderous attempt
I'm telling you pimp
Undeniably you are a loss
Invincible, why you trying to be a mind boss
If the Kon Artis say it then it's done
With or without a gun
Eat a track and spit out a drum
Bust one
Trust none
Playing the game of death
Take your last breath
'Til your last name is left

Chorus



INSTRUMENTAL




A man with no friends, only live for revenge
Live his life off the henge, cut, through a thousand men
Blade swing with the force of a cyclone
Cut crystal and bone, pistol and chrome
Stand in my path, you're a dead man
I cut the whole world in half for the Number One headband
Quest of a lonely soul, on a lonely road




(After the smoke is done)
Yo yeah
(Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one)
Yeah, what, what, who wanna do it, what
(After the smoke is done)
Slap fire outcha monkey ass niggas
(Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one)
Word up, big dick, motherfucking house
Whaddup, bench press these cats, yo


Yo, god show these niggas how we get deep, down and dirty
Like Keyon, got his wig pushed back, for 5 birdies
Yo they gotta hit placed on my head, what should the god do?
Max out in Spain and do business with the Jews?
Never that, don't ever look at me out of synch
The imperial, industrial king got weight
Don't give a fuck, like the poor part we watch Hart To Hart
They used to push me in shopping carts, now I'm writing darts
Like Ebenezer, the porno teaser
Saying words like sheeba, ____ rapper valet the visa
My team got rides like Six Flags, plus the Wu lab
Cameras in nine bedrooms we own DATs
Don't touch this crackling hot shit
I snap ya shoulder blade in half, laugh and pop shit
Reader's Digest passed my book to L. Ron Hubbard
It got back that the world government tried to dub it
But devils love it, booby-trap raps cover the track like ADAT
Sharper than cuts laced on Marley
Scratched supreme clientele, my cartel
Willie Stargel passed this shit his piece, where's the Nobel?
Oh well, signing off as usual
The arsonist leaving niggas lost in the stairwell


(Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one)
Yeah, yo, yo, represent my projects Stapleton
(After the smoke is done)
He represent that project Park Hill
(Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one)
You represent that project Murder West Brighton Now Born
Arm banging into that will (ahhhhh), word up
(After the smoke is clear)
Yeah, what, Stapleton
(Delphonics and Wu-Tang still here)
Park Hill, word up, yeah, yeah, New York


The greatest story ever told by me, precisely
Roman numeral IV plus three describe me
My son move like the toad, get drunk, speak in codes
Throw a fiend in the sleeper hold, got beef with the globe
Met my comrade, go half on this lab down in Baghdad
Flipping like a meth's tab, get money like an Arab
The tight niggas snapped six legs on the crab
Now hush, you wanna do what? My clique better bust


Underprivileged, grew up in a Stapleton house village
Where blood flood the water in streets like oil spillage
My front door was blowing, the debt man spotted 55 boa
Niggas was still flowing, voice was echoing
I rise high like an octave
The proctor wouldn't gamble the sample, it shocked her
My ninjas run round like Shaka Zulu, some play peace like Donny the Guru
Others live to be wise and old like Desmond Tutu
Undisputed champion belt holders, shaped and mould us
Soul controller of the lunar, solar or the polar
I blow hash smoke through my nasal, my brain with worth 30 billion
Wu-Tang  battalion was like cannibal weight in Brazilians


After the smoke is done
Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one
After the smoke is done
Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one
After the smoke is clear
Delphonics and Wu-Tang still here
After the smoke is done
Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one
Ahhhhh (Wuuuuuu, wuuuuuu)




Ladies and gentlemen give it up to the top notch
Stepping up not merely stepping over
Lets here it for the Gravediggaz


Yo we going to dig ya grave (4x)


Boo, you little bastards, rappers are in a casket
Situation is drastic, youre under the plastic
Compound fracture, huh, my skill a sing
Im rugged as the cross on a hill far away
As you react and shake to the track
I make rappers will evacuate
Cause I pack weight like
When bad I bury my vocabulary is, hahahaha, mad scary
The Grym Reaper appears I drink Redrum
Dead bones will cover the stage like bread crumbs
All I gonna say to yall brave niggas is
(Ahhh!) Im a Gravedigga


Yo, it aint safe, it aint safe no more
Yo, it aint safe no more
Oh, it aint safe, it aint safe no more
Yo, it aint safe no more


I was born deep in the valley of death where I stay hard
A buck mad child was raised in the graveyard
Straight from the darkness, I strike you regardless
Of who? Its obvious, my crew can demolish
Lounge in a burial ground point my death spot
I built my house on top of Salems Lot
Crazier than Hitler, boy how could you figure
Yaaaaah! That you could mess with a Gravedigga


Yo, we going to dig ya grave (4x)


The homicidal Gatekeeper, death is my speaker
I live in the dead zone, my graves getting deeper
The killer my gates, are closed for those basing
The Undertaker chase niggas like Jason
Master of death, I hold your breath
Like a ghost, G-Drink more blood than Bela Lugosi
Been in more dreams than Freddy prepare to get ready
Lilly was my mother and my brothers name is Eddie Monster
Im liver than the hell raiser
Sport a black long blazer, chilling in the morgue
Im insane with the trigger, raaaaaaaha! The Gravedigga


Meanwhile back in a jungle



We interrupt your program to bring you
*alot of static*

This is a Wu-Tang Killa Bee exclusive blast
*echoing*

Wake up, wake up, wake up

Wu-tang, Wu-Tang
Wu-tang, Wu-Tang
Wu-tang, Wu-Tang....


Bobby Steels, Staple' tales
MCs get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill
Is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist piercing holes in you
You can't escape seventy-thousand kilowatts
Blast through your box, walk with alarm clocks
Cars drive slow down the block
One stopped, parks, pops his trunk
Snares pops loud as Glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in ya face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
*Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up*
Love our queue got you drunk, you request the Wu
Flying monks fatal darts in your airwaves strike ya antenna
You feel the bass shiver
It makes your light get dimmer
Before you turn your dial from this
You best to slit your wrists
Through the soul of your heart like Don Cornelius
Unfamiliar, leave no trace like Simon Templer
Rhyme emperor, styles switch daily like temperature
In your atmosphere the rap racketeer
Six pack battery back, keeps 'em stacked
I live for hip-hop
And tall brown skin sugar plum who love the lollipops
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

Shorty I'm there for you anytime you need me

And I'mma walk these dogs so we can live
In a fat ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life, you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'mma make sure we
Be living in the fucking lap of luxury

But you did, now I'm going all out kid
And I got mad love to give, you my nigga

If you keep it real with me, I'll keep it real with you
Loving your whole steez, it be in there boo

Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own
No need to shop around you got the good shit at home
Even if I'm locked up North you in the world
Rocking three-fourths of cloth
Never showing your stuff off, boo

Then I can be your Sun, you can be my Earth
Resurrect the God through birth

"Yo, check this out, my name is the Ol' Dirty Bastard
Youknowhatimsayin, when I rhyme, when I, when I get down for my crown
I come out crazy like a, like a tiger, or something, knowhatimsayin
No, no, nobody can even F' with me, straight up and down
You knowhatimsayin', so that's how we coming in, knowhatimsayin?"
From the heart of Medina, to the head, to the east
To the plaza houses, a/k/a the Mountain
To the rugged lands of Shaolin, yo
We rock all, all, all in together now
Got played, got fresh, up---


The world was bugging off this Wu-Tang nigga on the rock
That was just another spot on the muthafuckin' block
You forgot Cash Rule nigga? Toss seven figures
He pull a trigger to make that account, get bigger
Had babies to feed, kept a bitch with need
Thousands shows booked, promoters on speed
His hands was in everything, including some pussy
From the Brazilian wax, to the uncombed bushy
From down state, psychiatric
Who tried to put a code on his brain until he cracked it
Now the media wanna view him like they knew him
And his head nurse, wanna sue him cause she blew him
Ever since he walked on stage, he was just a loose cannon
Wild drunk staggerin', nigga who kept standin'
Class clown, who erase chalk from the board
The only choir member, that sing off chord, we were


(All, all, all in together now)
Kept the balance, stay dressed for the weather now
Battle M.C.'s, anywhere, whatever town
And remain victorious, in any ground


The All In Together Now, started in Bed-Stuy
Human beatbox specialist, who dressed fly
A half ounce of blow and a forty ounce drinker
Magnificent flow, critical thinker
Unique is one grain of sand from the beach
And had bitches eating out of his hand
He was intelligent, his style was relevant
I can name ten niggas that stole an element
From the high speed chase to the court arraignments
All of the above, was entertainment
He caused earthquakes, just from experiments
Some thoughts got lost, not knowing where it went
His songs had a rep for many inducements
Giving birth to new styles, after recruitments
There's no replacement or any supplement
He was a new testament, what he said, what he meant, we were




The judge took a look at he, and threw the book at thee
The sentencing, would have made the average crook happy
They put him in a box, wrapped like a gift
In them straight jacket, watched by two, worked the shift
Gave him no phone calls, saw no sunlight
Like, Billie the Kid, in his last gun fight
Then days became weeks, weeks became months
Carved the calendar on the wall, with his fronts
The food pushed in, on the trays, looking sharp, in the cell
By hands covered with latex gloves
Cooks in the kitchen had laced his drinks
The wild ass physician, they was off the breaks
He got visits from shrinks who came in with ink-blots
Moving with they own plot, but the Dirt, he think not
He had nothing but time on his hands
As if he got a sign from the Clan, we were




All, all, all, in together now
"All in together now!" - Ol' Dirty Bastard
"All in together now!"
All, all, all, in together now
"All in together now!"
"All in together now!"
"All in together now!"
"All in together now!"
"All in together now!"
"All in together now!"
"Now white doesn't really wanna use up his few remaining pawn moves, so he plays king to e2"




'What they gives you, blood?'
'Three months, man.'
'Whatchu doin in here anyway? You oughta be home with your momma.  How old are you boy?'
'Thirteen.'
'Thirteen? Damn, the bastards must be runnin' outta niggas to arrest.'


Yeah, ohh yeah, this goes out
To all the families that went through the struggle
Yeah, from the heart
It was all from the heart, everything was real


All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through


Yo, dwellin' in the past, flashbacks when I was young
Whoever thought that I'd have a baby girl and three sons
I'm goin' through this difficult stage I find it hard to believe
Why my Old Earth had so many seeds
But she's her own woman, due to me I respect that
I saw life for what it's really worth and took a step back
Family ain't family no more, we used to play ball
Eggs after school, eat grits cause we was poor
Grab the pliers for the channel, fix the hanger on the TV
Rockin each others pants to school wasn't easy
We survived winters, snotty nosed with no coats
We kept it real, but the older brother still had jokes
Sadly, daddy left me at the age of six
I didn't know nuttin' but mommy neatly packed his shit
She cried, and grandma held the family down
I guess mommy wasn't strong enough, she just went down
Check it, fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment
Roaches everywhere, cousins and aunts was there
Four in the bed, two at the foot, two at the head
I didn't like to sleep with Jon-Jon he peed the bed
Seven o'clock, pluckin' roaches out the cereal box
Some shared the same spoon, watchin' Saturday cartoons
Sugar water was our thing, every meal was no frills
In the summer, free lunch held us down like steel
And there was days I had to go to Tech's house with a note
Stating "Gloria can I borrow some food I'm dead broke"
So embarrasin' I couldn't stand to knock on they door
My friends might be laughin', I spent stamps in stores
Mommy where's the toilet paper, use the newspaper
Look Ms. Rose gave us a couch, she's the neighbor
Things was deep, my whole youth was sharper than cleats
Two brothers with muscular dystrophy, it killed me
But I remember this, moms would lick her finger tips
To wipe the cold out my eye before school with her spit
Case worker had her runnin' back to face to face
I caught a case, housin' tried to throw us out of our place
Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyze the sky
And ask myself was I meant to be here... why?
Yeah, yo


All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through


Word up mommy, I love you
Word up
It was all you, word, you brought me in like this


I sit and think about
All the times we did without dad
I always said I woudn't cry
When I saw tears in your eyes
I understand that daddy's not here now
But some way or somehow, I will always be around, yeah
All the things that I did from this to them
Oh from drugs to being there
Being down and out and I love you always


Yeah, you say
You see the universe, which consists of the sun moon and star
And them planets, that exist in my space
Like man woman and child
You understand?
We got to keep it real, and what reality
And reality will keep it real with us
I remember them good ol' days
Because see, that's the child I was
What made me the man I am today
See cause if you forget where you come from, heheh
You're never gonna make it where you're goin', aheh
Because you lost the reality of yourself
So take one stroll through your mind
And see what you will find
And you'll see a whole universe all over again
And again and again and again and again




Somebody up and said "'Fest if I was you, I'd be more bitter"
I looked and said, "If I thought like you, I'd be more nigga"
More hater, more angry black man on an elevator
More cryin, less paper, that's when they come and take ya
Put you under the radar, push your record to later
Say "It could've been greater", now you a fuckin waiter, wait up!
This is hustle time, revolution muscle mind
Over matter but matter of fact, who can fuck with mine?
I was spitting these bars before I had a dime
Phoney broads sayin they love me, deals that were signed
Comin home, shorties getting killed all the time
On the block over a crumb of a crumb, in their prime
I'm, prime time, life, crime
Sex, drugs, the Lord of War, slugs, nines
Diamond mines, blood lines
Niggas say they got no love but we love dimes


Dwellin in the past, flashbacks when I was young
Whoever thought I'd have a baby girl and three sons?
I'm going through this difficult stage, I find it hard to believe
Why my old earth had so many seeds
But she's an old woman, and due to me I respect that
I saw life for what it's really worth and took a step back
Family ain't family no more, we used to play ball
Eggs after school, eat grits cause we was poor
Grab the pliers for the channel, fix the hanger on the TV
Rockin each other's pants to school wasn't easy
We survived winters, snotty nose with no coats
We kept it real but the older brothers still had jokes

Seven o'clock, pluckin roaches out the cereal box
We shared the same spoon watchin Saturday cartoons
Sugar water was our thing, every meal was no thrill
In the summer, free lunch held us down like steel
And there were days I had to go to Tex house with a note
Stating "Gloria can I borrow some food? I'm dead broke"
So embarrassin, I couldn't stand to knock on they door
My friends might be laughin, I spent stamps at stores
Mommy, where's the toilet paper? Usually newspaper
Look, Ms. Rose gave us a couch She's the neighbor
Things was deep, my whole youth was sharper than cleats
Two brothers with muscular dystrophy, it killed me
But I remember this, moms would lick her finger tips
To wipe the coal out my eye before school wit her spit
Case worker had her runnin back to face the face
I caught a case, housin tried to throw us out of our place
Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyse the sky
And ask myself was I meant to be here?... Why?


Huh, I hear ya Ghost, it's hard growin up black
But look to God and say...




'What they gives you, blood?'
'Three months, man.'
'Whatchu doin in here anyway? You oughta be home with your momma. How old are you boy?'
'Thirteen.'
'Thirteen? Damn, the bastards must be runnin' outta niggas to arrest.'


Check, my life fucked up
Can't complain a lot of times I done fucked up
Had tough luck, I ain't have enough love
Plenty nights I went to sleep ain't have enough grub
Or I ain't eat at all
Niggas couldn't live my life
Nowhere to go, sleeping outside I did that twice
No toilet paper, used socks, did that some nights
What the fuck did I do make me live so trife
I need heat at night
My stomach growl it wake me up, how I sleep at night
The wet aroma in the air, how I breathe at night
Everything that's in the dark gon see that light
So Imma see that light
I wanted to walk just like you
Wanted to talk just like you
Wanted to smoke wet and dip Ports, just like you
Heard you fuckin niggas for money, c'mon that's not you
Damn, I really hope that that's not true
I know Jamie feel left out too
I gotta be her brother, her father, I gotta step up too
Sometimes I rather see you dead, than to see you alive
I hate you, cause most the times you was the reason I cried
Most of the times you was the reason that I hated myself
On my own, can't wait to say I made it myself
When I was down and needed you, you never came to give help
You should be ashamed of yourself
But I ain't pointing fingers
Man what happened to my mom, you like a fucking stranger
But I still love you more than life, and I can't fucking change it
Just know I got us, we'll be good when I get fucking famous
When I get fucking famous
It's like God don't care
It's like some nights I can't call on him
I don't trust a soul, even my mom called the law on me
Told them I was trapping, that's the night I had jars on me
Why you wanna see your only son with a charge on him


Dear mom, I used to blame you for the time you missed
But just know I still love you
And dear daddy, for some years you had a nigga sick
But just know I still love you
Cause my struggle only made me stronger
I made it through the abuse, through the tears, through the hunger
I remember nights when I couldn't sleep
Hoping you would finally come around and tell me you could take me home
But that was only but a dream, no reality in sight
A lot of times I wanted to end my life, but I kept the pushing
I was truly just a lost soul
No love, didn't even have a stable place to call home
When I looked in the mirror I seen a blank face
And in my heart I can really feel it crying
A lot of deep emotion, a lot of things that I was feeling
Wondering how the fuck could you leave your son alone
In these places where these people only cared about a check
And had me eating grease out the bottom of the pan
And them fresh ass whoopings when you jumping out the tub
You know the one with the baby oil rubbed all on the belt
And I was only five
I used to wish ya would've fucking saved me
Would've held me tight and raised me like your baby
Would've been around and watched me grow into a man
But Im older now, I'm in the world, and now I understand




Continous
Yeah, youknowhatI'msayin?
Wu-Tang
Aiyyo aiyyo, come on yo yo yo I'mma shoot over here
On that AIDS thing
YouknowhatI'msayin? I'm gonna just slide in the studio quick and get this done
Yo, yo


When you're sexually frustrated, plus waiting for a long time
You both had strong minds
Combined with feelings, she seems appealing, for each other
Discreet lover, no longer keeps rubbers
Smothered under deep covers
Erotic programs, Moet and slow jams
Enough to make you hold hands and plus you a bold man
You fall in a manhole, where the forbidden tree grow
And bullshit ego, of fly negro
Her garden sour, polluted with a dead flower
Months later, he's layin on a respirator
Depending on a generator, to keep his heart moving
And start losing sight in his right eye
In weeks he might die


I know this dope-fiend cat, word up, his name is Javier
Part-time shooter sharing needles in the stairs
Wise guys disguised as a fly guy, you getting high right?
Weeded up with red shit in your right eye
You's a menace, your brain cells finished
Begging forgiveness, calling that up top shit syphillis
You know what you was gettin into
Try to guess on what I've been through
Fuck shorty raw then she scared you


AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from the Wu, it's real
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from my crew, it's real


My nigga Chuck, he loved to fuck
Everything exotic bitches down to ugly ducks
Like Nancy, who liked the fancy tickles so he put popsicles
On her nipples to make her sex passion triple quadriple
Until she bust
Overcome with passion, big ass want lust upon him
But nigga he forsake to grab the condom
Fuck it, he said AIDS, was government made
To keep niggas afraid so they won't get laid no babies be made
And the black population will decrease within a decade
German warfare product against the dark shade


AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from my crew, it's real
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from the Wu, it's real


Caught by the gravitation earth rotation
Six in the sex is deep, when you can't see clear
Through the sheer brassiere, toke back
Smoking a spliff, sippin cognac, God
You know my two love songs, Bobby Womack tracks
Got her fat ass layin flat on her back


Yo, as she lay, she wore a silk gray neglige
Alize pours, the radio play, Marvin Gaye
What's Going On? As she screams Sexual Healing
Couldn't fight the feeling her legs hit the ceiling
Hitting all positions dipped in for quick love
She's professional, she does this shit in strip clubs
Flied in June until she Acquired Immune Deficiency
Now misery is the syndrome


Oh shit, God that's wild
Damn, that's some cherry flavor shit going on though kid
For real, knowhatI'msayin?
What about the exotic type
Caskets is waitin for brothers
Word up slide on the joints baby
Before you go to sex take protection
Word up

AIDS kills, word up respect this
America Is Dying Slowly (4x)

Yeah, word yo, sliding up in this store right here
I ain't even playing that man, for real
Dig it
Respect how I'm living kid
Here forever, word up
Lubricated joints, ribbed joints is bangin
But they still playing the hotel door man
Word, you know how that be though, you know how that be
Yo, just gettin to be too old
Chick over there lookin like Sonny and Cher
Over there
Yeah
America Is Dying Slowly
Surely
America Is Dying Slowly
America Is Dying Slowly
Remember that! Syndrome, be the resident
America Is Dying Slowly
Wu-Tang, Syndrome, be the resident

Digital. Childish Gambino
Mixtape demonstrations


This Oxycontin carbon monox' and toxic concoction
Collapse your brain cells, they swell from lack of oxygen
Leave the opposition stuck, without a pot to piss in
Hockin', spitting up blood, shark by sharp precision
Dart incision, darkness imparts your vision
Sparks infliction, (Poof) I'm a mad magician
Verbal plasma, verbal scatter, words that shatter
Every atom in your body, now you're anti-matter
Ripping through the data, checked into the doctor
Took his rhyme splatter, cause my mind's faster
You falling down to ground, while I climb the ladder
Too much garbage in your gallbladder, fall flatter
On your face, now you carry by the pall-bearer
Or wear the black suit, eyes all teared up
Oh no, when your ho make a boss lit up
We in the rib with a smirk nigga, all geared up
Childish Gambino or Bobby Digi'lino on the tracks
We breaking more backs that Sammartino, Bruno
We saw more baselines than Juno
Change more law in New York than Mr. Cuomo
Godfather novels I write like Mario Puzo
Master time fix the clocks like I'm Hugo
Hold the weight like nine sumos
Bust shots like John Lugo
You know how the Wu go


Look sharp, homie give yourself a face lift
High brow, eyebrows on a spaceship
Take sips of that Ace of Spades-es
Saving all my money just to waste on a bracelet
Can't see them haters, we dont give a fuck though
Charge it to the game, keep a lame so cutthroat
Never slip a fast one, the game is so in front of me
Travel 'round the globe, spend and make 'bout a 100 G's
Pack them crowds up, boss like Bowser
Deep pocket poetry, my custom trousers
Thank God they found us, the game was starvin'
I'm clean and concrete, you ass and Charmin
Bobby Digital, Do you really think these niggas know shit?
Shopping in Manhattan and I ran into my old chick
Pride is a bitch. I am not a grown up
Tweetin' when I'm 70, these half-dead followers
She look like she Spelman, secretly she Hofstra
Put her in the club, all she wanna hear is Waka
Put her in the crib, all she wanna hear is Waka
She jerk when I move like her old boy popped her
Home is that Outkast, soul like I'm Phonte
Old-school J's like Beyonc's fianc
Back on on my dumb shit, nigga we the stupidest
Gave them niggas real shit, don't know what to do with it
I did what I did man, did you really see it though?
'Bino hard and fast, niggas sweet and low
American Royalty, family loyalty
We cream of the crop why the fuck would we stop?
She had two sons: both of 'em good grades
Both of 'em rap songs
Where did she go wrong?
Nowhere mama, we just go where the money at
Black Kennedy, where the fuck you niggas at?




Explosions in the Israeli town of Yafo
In central Israel near the Ben-Gurion International Airport
This first blast, uh, occurred about 1 and a half hours ago
That's about half past eight in the morning Israeli time
A second blast occurred 10 minutes later in another vehicle
Parked a couple hundred meters away from the first blast


Defeat your enemies with violence, not culture refinements
Right? And show your love diamonds that's blinding
Under the eyelids of men, women and children of all color and religion
I guess building underneath the ceiling of a universal temple is essential
To break through the iron fists of war and swinging damn swords
See, Remedy and I, we swarm as one colony to make you wonder what you die for
But why you murdering our kids?
When all we've got to defend ourselves with our bricks
And stones, can't you hear us moan?
We all out on the streets cause you destroyed our home
Nah, you took our food, shelter, and clothing and left us naked
Only to cover ourselves with black seeds of hatred
But right now, whoever's right or wrong
I wonder if we'll ever get along as brothers from different mothers


I heard a boy crying, two kids dying
Young Israelis, they said the Palestinians were lying
Who's to blame? We set fire to your flame
They withheld the names of the Jews held in vain
Jump into a tank in the far West Bank
There's violence on the Gaza Strip, who's to thank?
Listen! Babies crying
Life lost, Holocaust style, bodies flying
Surprise and surround you, we run rings around you
Silver with the blue and white stars-who we are
We unite, people alike
Strength comes in numbers, all ready to fight
Humanity's song for peace
There's war going on in the Middle East
Build, destroy, build the beast
Sharon and Arafat, Remedy, counter-attack
What's The Cure? Yo, RZA, where you at?


Positive education: always correcting errors
You can never gain peace by inflicting terror
And strapping bombs to arms
Running up inside buildings killing little children and moms
Instead of trying to take land, y'all should shake hands
And give respect to the great father Abraham
You've been fighting over Palestine since Saladin
Have you learned what the word 'non-violent' mean?
Or turn the other cheek? You burn your brother cheap
When ten grip came home we gave his brother sheep
RZA used to be recruiting troops and shooting fruit
When you both be seeds from the same root
Even when young Moses was lost in the desert
He was taught wisdom from an Arabian Shepard
My pen is mightier than CNN
Right now I teach you how to see an end
Close your eyes silently, breathing deep
Inhale this air all the way to your feet
Then exhale slowly through your nostril
Combine the Torah, Qu'ran, with the Gospel
With your mind open and eyes shut
You can't tell the difference of who's who and what's what
Please educate Allah's children everyday
A lesson a day keeps the devil away




You go up to release
You release you come down
And at times I can see your face now
Accompany a celestial sound
When the shadows keep your pace now
Even even the time flows
Even even the time flows (away)
Even even the time flows over me
Leave aside the beautiful lies
Thats all there is to lose


Love is a house and you got the keys
Im like a city mouse mama you got the cheese
James Brown sung
Please please please, try me
Mama dont leave
So how do we keep the music playing
How do we keep our love song from fading out
Even if the sun burns out
Mama dont leave cause I cant live without you


You go up to release
You release you come down
And at times I can see your face now
Accompany a celestial sound
When the shadows keep your pace now
Even even the time flows (away)
Even even the tide flows over me
Leave aside the beautiful lies
Thats all there is to lose


When a man loves a woman
When a man loves a woman
He would travel far lands (to lose)
And cross the deepest seas
Send his soldiers to war
Like Trojans and Greece (to lose)
Many kings lost their lands at a womans hand
Marie Antoinette caused the fall of France  (toulouse)
So good was her love that my circumstance
Left me in the mud for a second chance
I'm in a love debt
Because I owe so much
She was with the Joneses
I was tryna keep up
Tryna keep my feet above water
Fell of a cliff
Can I get a lift, Can I get a tip
Oh aint that a trip
When love let you slip
Into a love debt
Into regret
But I would do it all again
Just to hold her skin


Time will take your place in no time
Fly away for days hypnotized
Even even the time flows over
No waste away
Time will take your place in no time
Time will take your place in no time
Fly away for days hypnotized
Even even the time flows over
No waste away




Fuck y'all analog niggas we be digital
Wu-Tang, Killarmy we indispensable
We never fall, we stand tall like sky-scrapers
...and justice for all
(So fuck y'all, so fuck y'all niggas)


We move on MCs mechanically, strike nerves like Ghost's verse on 'Can It Be'
Hard to touch retarded fucks playing with their fantasies
Respect this, specialist, black, testing this will get ya necklace jacked
And name scratched up off my guest list
Party freak, you the type of nigga that'll hardly speak unless you spoken to
You throw a cold screw, but sober up when I'm approaching you
At the same time we posting two
Niggas on that ass that's gonna do what they supposed to do
The limelight, snatched away from you because it's my night
Killarm blaze hot in the twilight, you better get ya lines right
Half of these crabs can't even rhyme right
With dust flows, robotic movement and blurry eyesights
What you want I already got and that control
I keep my head high, hand upon cock and pockets swollen
You folding, you faggot ass fuck


Yo, my words should never fail
Shootin' darts sharper than a carpenters nail
Inhale life, exhale strive anxiety's trife
Blowin' smoke out my peace pipe
Ducking the snipe shot off the top of the White House
A cop pauses, war never does its many causes
My offense is my defense extreme precautions
Moving cyphers high velocities making you nauseous
Ya forcing it, terrorist extortionists, aborting this
Space ship that's spacious face it, almost can taste it
Pioneer looking for honey and is it matrix
The case is, if not ya basic, way to make shit
Embrace it, knowing some day you'll have to face it


Fuck y'all analog niggas we be digital
Wu-Tang, Killarmy we indispensable
We never fall, we stand tall like sky-scrapers
...and justice for all
(So fuck y'all, so fuck y'all niggas)


Hard to grapple, my razor sharp scalpel technique
Slaps you, invasion body snatch you, money grip
I smoke the honey dip blunts, cherry bomb very calm
Verse bursts like a shot from the Berry homes
You'd be most wise to pay close attention to Willie Lynch-in'
It's stupid to fuck with Bobby Steel's henchmen
I step into presidential credentials
It's evident, my potential be infinite
Deluxe magnetic flux invincible, Obi-Wan Kenobi
Sword record in Dolby, Alexis Colby broad try to control me
Pussy whip me like Toby
Fuck the local, I move global
Economical, give seeds promised fool
My info glow In the dark, Wu-Tang logo sparks your attention
Look listen observe, Killa Bee swerve
Slam like Dr. Julias Erv, still strike the vital nerve
Charter through the Magna Carta, trapped like Otis and Carter
Wild like a Shaolin child from Mariners Harbor
King I Divines, lost his shines
Head burst open like a bottle of Pine
Use penmanship when I write my script, blunt spark em' and them mark em' homeless
Killa Hill syndrome, peace to Two Tone
You must know me to understand me
And once you do, you realize I'm you, everything I do
Honey bee from the bee hive, ever-green freeze dried
Leaf smoke, Killah Priest from the tribe of Levi
Spoke, thou shall not steal or blunt spill
The indestructible Bobby Steeles is here


Yo In The Heat of The Night
My 4-7-7 Mash on the mic
Killarmy and Trappa John M.D
Full metal jackets 'cause some gots to have it
Kill or be killed only time will reveal
I think by myself and I drink by myself from '98 until
Let me know its real son if its really real
Understandable, self explainable, caution
John Blaze flammable when under pressure, interchangeable and still
Coming down like precipitation as I reign undisputed
How Johnny do it? Dangerously
Whooping cough (cough, cough), chewing off
Stank pussy make my dick sore
Bottom line be this, high explosive
Not for the average Joseph, come and get some
Hold eight and keep one, up in the chamber
Blast with my middle finger
9 swordsmen attack like the Four Horsemen
See me dog walking, strictly ghettio slang talkin'
All up in these guts, often, these rap niggas official
We slap niggas with mad charges
Dope shit regardless
We usually take another niggas garments, what?


Straight up and down I got this rap shit locked in '98
Niggas can't escape the laws that I enforce
Like top notch politicians who be politicking
Slam through and expand total construction across the planet
And micro chip software placed in the rear of ya ear
As I slid to next year
All y'all analog niggas fuck y'all we be digital, shit is critical
Like the hallways in my projects
Similar to the streets in Tibet
Fuck that, I ain't playing with a full deck son




Another summer love, another summer kiss
Another summer touch, that brings me to your bliss


Oops, upside of my head, you knocked me out the bed
You got me spacing like Bill & Ted
The heels with the red, Gucci bag and the shades
Plus the red lipstick, your honey blonde braids
Mama-mama-mama, comma-comma
You got me like Ralph and Alice, hummy-nee-humma-humma
Man, sugar cake, you make a brother shake
Away from his boys, away from his toys
Away from the guns and noise
I'm astounded by your beauty, your style and poise


Aiyo, summertime with a sexy ass waistline
Round like a dime, so I hit you with a fine line
Design for your mind, we can take a walk on the beach
Fendi sandals on your feet
With a fly Prada dress, I'm impressed, never the less
You flowing with the best, nice nipples on your breasts
Street Mary Jane, you my candy cane
Going shopping in Spain, on a private plane




Tempted by your voluptious ass, yo, it's sicker, mama
Choose you over family and cash, yo, almost love the drama
Five foot eleven, Nature Boy, I'm what's happening
Baby, write your number and name down on that napkin
Written in lipstick, she fold it and kissed it
Slipped it, hid it so quick, I nearly missed it
Blown away by her presence and her Dolce perfume
The one, with a hand of Egyptian, no what's soon
Summer love




A lovely summer night, two lovers holding tight
Our bodies by the shore
A morning summer light, just through the window shades
Your taste is on my lips
Another summer day, another summer night
Another summer day, another summer night






I believe that someone can be brave on this green earth
But maybe Im wrong, maybe Im wrong
Game on


Turn dreams to reality
The king of principality
Shines upon me
The holy spirit shadows me
I write songs for fun not for salary
Used to collect guns now the truth is my cavalry
But I gotta closet full just in case the project pulls some wicked bullshit
My logistics is logical
Turn you back to molecules, minuscule follicles
Then convert your brain to subatomic particles
I breathe you in, I sneeze you out
You MCs, you live in degrees of doubt
Thats why I swarm on your college dorm
Make knowledge born from the hood to the cottage farm
London to Russia
Eurasia to Prussia
The holy cities of it the east the young shieks discuss us
Christ means crusher
We come along to usher the righteous way of life
Itd be most wise for the civilized man to trust us
On Bora Bora, we discuss the Torah
Then we travel across these lands like old explorers


I believe that someone can be brave on this green earth
But maybe Im wrong, aim for the sun
Out in the freezing rain, I will stay on the streets all day
Until my cup runneth over
We always fight blind the light of our lives
My patience is waning, the scales have capsized
I read news full of glory
And there's pyres of files alight feeding mazes
To the night sky


Sittin on a porch, torching a stogie in the moonlight
Rockin back and forth in my chair, contemplating life
Thinking where I went wrong, where I went right
Was it a fast? Or a long life
From my calculation, everyday sensational
Every sense were stimulated, pains occasional
All praise is due to the father, the author
The supreme architect, the one with no partner
We give man the wisdom to be a gardner, carpenter
Priest or warrior, king or you can be a scholar
Husband wife child mother brother sister or father
All these things the heart consists of
Keep the planet floating gigantic like atlantic ocean
7 ounces deflect, reject
All satanic notions
We so elusive


I believe that someone can be brave on this green earth
But maybe Im wrong, aim for the sun
Out in the freezing rain, I will stay on the streets all day
Until my cup runneth over
Runneth over
Runneth over
Runneth over
Now I see theres some way to be free as a sea bird
And maybe Im gone, straight for the sun
Out in the freezing rain, I will stay on the streets all day
Cause my cup runneth over




Do you remember me? I remember you
And all that you have done
Murderer, monster
How many hundreds of lives have you ended?
How many thousands have you made mourn the lost of their loved ones
Now it's your turn


Straight from the Rotten Apple, rock headbands and Afros
Swords are sharp, get ready to rap, yo
Life part reality, part-part two
On and swizzy, he illuminate the groove
He get less friends and more enemies
Style get hittin' me, bars about his pennies
He understand the art of war, gettin' this chick
What she bargain for, a killer who heart is pure
Young Samurai, let the gun go
The blood amplify, living by a landslide
Warrior who see death around the corner
I execute first, yeah, God upon us
Afro, always stick to the script
Fry the biggest fish who on the list
Well trained in the arts, he had
Many battles in parks, before the real action spark
Afro stamina, reap what you sow
Yeah, we the chosen, you can teach the glow
Just like LeRoy he The Last Dragon
See that boy, Afro's my decoy
Blow up, house or village on my journey
Sting before it burn me, fascinate before they learn me
My arch nemesis, a god that's man, eye of genesis
She know I got the best sword that senses, stay in the trenches
Art who kill you in inches


The Afro hand shit sharp his sword, stay swinging
It's war, where angels, Gods & demons


Aiyo, Duel of the Iron Mic
It's 52 ways to get hit when my iron strike
Travel the land, shotgun into some thing
Aim straight for the top, spot the womb, get men
Cut her up, it's all game, hit 'em out the ballgame
Move to the left, never slow in the wrong lane
Architecht flow, disect your paradine
Guillotine sword, you fraud, you can't battle I
Aliby? My blade, in your blood
When it's war time, believe it's no love
Resurrect from the top of the set, blows up
Chop straight through to ya neck, ya show's up
Ninja, talk slick, money out his injure
Never bite the hand that feed ya or defend ya
It's MoeRoc, Samurai with a chrome Glock
Don't shock, through the diagram, and it don't stop


The mission eclip', Afro on his tip
Be all, see all, if he ready to tee off
I got to kill a man, as soon he off
The sword lead off is all our action
Bazooka watching, what's happening
Yeah, Samurai fire, a bulletproof attire
After every war, Afro elevate higher
It's war, is it in there?



(come on in)

Dinn-dnn-dnn-ta-dnn
(come on in)
Dinn-dnn-ta-dnn, dinn DNN DAH
(come on, come on, come on in)
Dnn-da-duh-duh-DAH, you BITCH ASS niggas!
(come on in, come on, come on, come on in)


As high as Wu-Tang get
Allah allow us pop this shit
Just like black shoe fit
If you can't wear it, well don't fuck with it!


Yo, too many songs, weak rhymes that's mad long
Make it brief Son, half short and twice strong
No doubt, it took time searchin, eventually
It was prime urgent, for you to examine the rhyme merchant
Lace MC's with styles when they rhyme drunk
On a label hunt, until twenty thou, out the trunk
Eight Diagram sword swinga armored tank force
RZA throw in the disc but then change the bank source
You can't flow, must be the speech impediment
You got lost off the snare off Impeach the President
Whether in Amsterdam smokin seven grams of green
Then you pack, a thousand white teens in tight jeans
This Witty Unpredictable shot is critical
To analytical analogy, insurance policies why
Said he know that sounds define the note
Couldn't recognize, blast him the fuck behind the ropes
Too many dope niggas I see starvin
Catch a single deal, a possible plea bargain
Wu slay regardles to whom or what, five mics five nights
Hang him from the balcony, drop twenty-five flights
A fugitive bass playin rap czar
Smoke the cigars, his prints on the strings of his guitar


As high as Wu-Tang get
Allah allow us pop this shit
Just like black shoe fit
If you can't wear it, well don't fuck with it!


Tical got a hold on ya, doin exactly
What the fuck I mariju-wanta, dis nigga nasty
Deep in the dirty dungeon, buggin, lovin
The ways these rhymes keep comin, at cha splash ya
Get your head piece fractured, with killer cuts
From the Shropshire Slasher, rip shit up
Got this whole thing Tang mastered, sho nuff
An MC too good to be touched, John John
Bring the phenomenon, I cold crush
MC, inferiorities they froze up, ice cold
As we move on, saga unfold
Captivated by a saga that go untold, like Goldfinger
Caught up in a cliffhanger
Yo I-N-S another code red, danger, break out the vest
Now it's tactical warfare, it's all here
Come with your shield and hardware, it be on here
Don't ever roam, in the naked city
Eight million stories none pretty
Bomb em wit the Witty Unpredictable
Conditionin' be critical
Peace to Tang, gettin high on your physical, dis next drink
Is a toast to your memory
When I go how many niggas gon' remember me


As high as Wu-Tang get
Allah allow us pop this shit
Just like black shoe fit
If you can't wear it, well don't fuck with it!




Here in the first chapter
First, first, first, the last, the last, the last
(And It Was Written)
Here in the first chapter {of life, life, life}


Life tell lies, death in our face
Every other day we killin off our own race
Whether drugs, guns, somethin common known
This is the place that we all call home


Here in the first chapter, draws attention
Begins all that we've forgotten, sense of smell, then parallel
Wide scale, Putnam Avenue good stopper
Puttin 'nam on the map A/K/A Putnam Avenue facts
Rugged's incorporated, teflon penetrated
College's still important, that leave ya blood on it
Comin out of meditation, words become radiation
Anticipatin any next motivation, fakin on the federation
Yo, black, who that? Where he at?
Fuck him, I guess I 'ttempt death, settin it off as a black on black
Even SWAT-men don't swindle as ya fire get put out of his kindle
As the day, break ten nights
Even the knowledge better call on ya odds
Scream from ya lungs, "Allah U Akbar!"
Rap Tai Chi Master, chess player 'til I'm plasma
Your thought get broke down ten years from now
Doin a matter like I'm on after this has-been
A rap industry master, 60 Second Assass-sinner
When it get down to it, iiiiit lay down more black men after
Now who? What? Challenger, challenges universal balances of analysis
Another level from bein talented
Travel the world with a gift that shoots like silencers
The fifty-two Glock, Riker's Islander


Protons-Electrons (silence this)
Always-Cause-Explosions


My occupation on the plantation, survival in the land of psychos
Deluded with men, polluted within, engaged in sin
Sparkin wars against the veteren, the righteous herbal medicine
And antidotes from Bed-Stuy to Park Slow
Strives, I spoke and wrote, made to condense into smoke
Knowledge these author, holdin a black Oscar, inhalin ganja
The here and after, shatterin bones, copin the matter
The seventh chapter, a rapture begins, is a disaster
Demolishin fake advocators, perpetrators
Nigga haters, hydro-chronic blowin out the generator
There's no need so please son don't proceed
To get yourself broke up, flamed like some trees


I could trap all the people who dare try to release ya meat
Or grievin in the force, I sieze
Believin in, by the time, a mystery could fall out the skies
Our necks'll be permanently paralyzed
Foolish enough to camouflage lies
And we dyin in Hell, I arrive half dead
But now ressurected, my head connected
To the correct, directions to Heaven
My mind is projected for miles
But they say our spirit is accepted, to dwell
Inside reality, I take adavantage
Destroy y'all, give brain damage
Returnin heads into an abandoned, buildin
Rich, the innocent, the infants
The rent, come talk to homeless thoughts of an immigrant
To all predators, competitors, united reptiles and etcetera
I be the black threat to America
Disconnectin the microchip in ya mind
Then replace with dispent knowledge, I represent
With intelligence for evidence, I let the skeleton out the closet
The soul keeper, deeper than meditation, feel my concentration
I demolish heads like the board of education


As it is written.. as it is written
My New Year's resolution, I read the whole book of U. Edward B. Newton
The only solution is a revolution, the black evolution
Will happen, one-hundred-twenty-fifth in Manhatten
Strappin, I stop the tappin bein caused by Timberland's
I got the Devil tremblin and rememberin the time
When you had a fiesta, all robbed dead ancestors
I got a full clip for you Uncle Festers
You best to prepare or beware, I'm out to hit up the Red Square
Located where? In Russia, plus ya politicians
And ya Christian society, they unwind me with hate
Now I'm ya enemy because I tell you the truth
Or is it because I got proof from wearin army suits?
Christ is black and I got facts, readin revelations
I got tons of information, that's why I pack more heat than insulation
Twelve lost tribes of a nation just waitin for Satan
To make his move, so I could show and prove
So let me hear the war drums a little louder
Let me hear a chord rush, ya holler
No man knows the hour, nor the time
But surely it's comin as it is written, as it is written
As it is written, as it is written, as it is written..


No man knows the hour, nor the time
No man knows the hour or the time
No man knows the hour or the time
We'll surely be comin, as it is written, as it is written
As it is written




Poisonous! Poisonous
RZA... RZA

 (x4)
If you get paid like the rent, represent


Check it out as I freak that, nigga peep that
Mother'ucker you can beat that, while we keep that
Coming where you sleep at, you repeat that
We deal with the fleet that, bring more than Miami Heat and a Gat


I be the insane with the thin frame and the pimp game
You should maintain 'fore I blast your mainframe
Leave you in pain, everything sprained
I get bizzum, with the izm in the brain
Poor like Kane and Biz was all prism
Before I bust shots I prefer to bust jizzum
Throw up in cement I know the art of busism
I can hear the chop with the cop just diss em
Dismiss them, piss them, no one'll miss em
I got styles and mad files you can't list em
I glisten, man listen, I take the mic and my hand break the stand like...


I spend time like a big, to get rid
Of all the booty shit, that's in the mid
So now you know, kid

Scientifik, know to rip shit bona fide
Yo Ed, them niggas said we couldn't hit another (fly?)


My mind's in another state like a stomen
I could rip it , possess like the omen
Make noise like Roman, illining like Conan
The barbarian, rugged nigga from the bury in
Get your pin in your best suit to get buried in
You'll never win, got to come again, while we running it
Got you done again, just for fun again, still coming in
Number 1 again, yeah we won again

Michael Douglas, check it spit


I spend time like a big, to get rid
Of all the booty shit, that's in the mid
So now you know, kid




My number's unlisted, cause you missed it
Eat your ass like a biscuit with chicken 'n a mystic
I kicks it like niggas on a Friday, they number one
Getting high day, ground my way, on and on like a highway
And your girl like a dry way, get you side ways, for 9 days
Plus she brought the blaaaaze


I have real niggas flippin', with the clip in, and they wide
Just dip in, with the fat Glock on the hip 'n
Trippin', rippin', the top on the nickin'
Sicken, slicken, all around sticken
Lickin', shots, vickin', spots
From the pan, to the motherfuckin' pots
Give it nots, taking punk's change like slots
It's the ghetto, Mr. Edo what you got?


I got to get you with the flav, plus I'm mad hiiigh like a wave
You could rave, if you're that brave, dig ya grave
Jump a hay, although I'ma hit you, when I snap like a picture
Then I getcha, even when you're withcha, crew
I smoke a blunt, drink a brew, that's just what a nigga do
I had to cut a few, niggas off, cause they was sauce
Getting in-between shit like floss, and now they lost
Only wanna come around for the video
Acting itty bitty though
Just like a silly ho, really though
You better act like you hear me though
Cause I have prepare me, yo


To start beef shit, gonna creep shit, with your deep shit
Not the weak shit, peep shit, as I freak shit

As long as your punk ass motherfuckin' know






There's no coke

You heard me you dumb fuck, there's no coke
What the fuck do you mean there's no coke?

I've been in every fucking room
There's gotta be coke
There is nothing, nothing

*heavy panting*
Help PLEASE!
*panting continues*
Help me!
*gunshot*


It's assassination day, I stalk


I move through the Third World, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I live's a 25 to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
Cream is short, Cee Cipher Power stalk, plus the fiend talk
3 Gs the cost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen goal but it fail
Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter
Devil's poisoning the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened
Trapped in deep water, gasping
I clash with the titans for my half on the action


I stop producers careers, the weak spot was the ears
Scorpion darts hits the mark, pierce the heart with silver spears
You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still feel this so you're living build tilted
MCs upon their axis, their body hazard tactic
Lactic acid, desert dry cactus, practice
You can never match this invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice
The mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches
Unforgivable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects more livable
Interchangeable, caution: flammable
My chamber is 99 plus 1  unnameable angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
We creep through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare


First of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don
Spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurging, merging in the suburbs
Using this just like an adverb, action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aiming like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pa
You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Holding like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high, yo Bobby
You hear how I'm shooting it like they blue tops
No, you won't play me like your lady
Pay me 380, spit it at you like a baby, final destination Haiti


War's extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take things to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MCs to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue death than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in
Murderous rhyming, constantly inclining
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain then absorbs the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback





:
Yo, peace and blessings
My name is the RZA, from the all mighty Wu-Tang Clan
I'm zonin' in with my home girl, SZA
Self-savior, Zig-zag-zig, Allah
Yeah, I think you can take it that far mama
You know what I mean?
Cut loose the drama
No melodrama
Rise to the top
Claim yo karma
And it's my honor
To drop this lesson
It's my honor
To give this blessing

:
Self-savior
Sophisticated syncopations
Smokers several strands of high potency stimulation
A soulful songstress
See, sometimes a woman is the strongest one inside the cypher
So why y'all niggas all getting hyper, huh?
She could be stubborn born, yeah, but she could never be stupid
You may think that she's being strange
Nah, she's being wise and being studious

:
Reverse the S, it's stress girl, return it back to a Z
The zig-zag-zig, yeah
So find a zig in me
The Xena who could rise again
Up on the ashes like a phoenix
Usable zillionaires
So fuck all y'all rap billionaires
Haha, hey
Self-savior boy, we told you, you better save yourself
You stupid motherfuckers, you putting wealth before yo health
In every drop of semen, there's a potential human being
In every man that's born through the womb of a woman is born here as a free man
In every womb will carry the chance for life and infinity
In every woman she has inside her divine identity
But y'all got it backwards boy
So you need to get smacked backwards boy
Back into the past
Yo, let's backtrack their ass
And zero out these zombies
These weak ass Uncle Tommys
My-

:
Yo, see Allah's the all I see and the all knowin', the all flowin'
Over land, sea, sky and the ocean
The controller of space, time, and motion
From darkness of the universe to the first letter of this verse
Amplified through your Apple device
Appearing as a voice, her, SZA
Cut through them, paper thin
Open up their ears and let the melodies enter in
And whether sober or drunk, smokin' bongs, or smokin' blunts
Let's get it mama, they can't front
With self-savior, zig-zag-zig through apex
Nah, ain't nothin' change
But yo, yo baby girl
Do what the fuck you gon' do and shine on these niggas, aight
So they can understand, yo




Light is shinin.. beauty sunshine
Here comes one-time.. the ball was so fine
Heat is blazin.. the kids were playin
His partner was shady.. tryin to save the babies


A-yo, they didn't know the cop was crooked
He had blow out in Brooklyn
All this while he let the fiends cook it
The baseheads stirred it up, plus they got to blow it up
Dropped it off in the PJ's and they bigged it up
Then one day, shit jumped off real crazy
The middle of a bathroom they find an old lady
No clothes, half of her tongue, ear missin
The killer had to be mad smart, he wore mittens
Even though her leg was bitten
Crackheads point the finger at Detective Slick Morris Gittins
Paleface cop who done popped the best
And got the chop on his neck from when he knocked Celeste
It was a slug, drug, he pressured everybody on the block
Some niggas know him as the Godson of Gotti
And his black partner, he was scared to speak
He saw how they planted weapons on these kids in the street
He saw like over fifty bodies in like fifty-two weeks
He saw his colleague pick up money before leavin his beat
They call him desk duty, Robocop
Younger dudes call him Freddy Krugs from the way he walk on the block




Heard the disturbance out the window, oh shit they got my son
Pulled over his Tempo, Brenda dropped the endo
Had her little nephew with her yo she didn't care
They always harassed her, until she blew the captain with a razor
His partner turned red in his waist, maced her, smacked her
With the walkie, yoked her then slammed her on her face
He bugged on her like she was drugged, plugged one in her
The fifth relaxed her like a big thug pistol whipped her
Heard she was dusted, must've been the way they threw the cuffs on her
She broke the shits, went and rushed the kid
Wavin her hands, she had a half an axe, all in her tracks
He grabbed her by the hair, she broke his jaw it cracked
More cops arrived, they both bloodied down by the five
Wildest niggas just smilin cause it look live
They gave her forty years in New Orleans, callin me wodie
Shorty was young, by three days had a great bid




You're just worms in the worst part of the apple that's rotten
You squirm and you turn from the right, still plottin
All slimy cause you stay grimy, petty crimey cat
You sometime me, don't need to remind me about
Livin in the core, with the scramblers in front of the store
The bum holdin the door, the mugging no one saw
We played ball in the alley where dope was shot raw
And the school they kept flawed, plus the lowest test scores
Small percentage determined to strengthen they position
Transformation from critical to, stable condition
But it still be obstacles on niggas that's optical
Watchin you like salt-water sharks that's tropical
The money was the root and it's the instinct to make it
With they pockets and fridge naked, many aim to take it
Whether - hold up, set up, stabbin or a wet up
Just to know it was the kid next door fizzucked your head up
Once he fell short, frequently visit the courts
And for some, another way out, is music and sports
That's why I, keep the rhyme just as fly as a shot
That won the championship, with just oh on the clock

 - repeat 2X




Yo, are you taping baby?
Baby are you taping?
Ohh yeahhahhahheeyahhhyahhhhohhhyahhhh
Baby baby c'mon, baby c'mon, baby c'mon
What the fuck anybody wanna do?
Right motherfucking now!
Ahhahhahhhah


I'm the God who's ahead of the Lords
Dirty Bastard from the Wu-Tang squad
Can I get raw, yes I get Dirty to the floor
Rhymes, hittin on your mind, you could never ignore
Hip-Hop to me is like a place to be
My specialTY from me to you is emCEE
Say what you wanna sayyyahhh, baby sayahh
I flip the microphone-ah, any dayahh
I'm mad swift because I got that gift of gab
Niggas get mad, your ass never had
This talent that I got will riz-zock the spot
MCs, you got paid a lot
You ever notice a black man damn mostly slams
When it come to the money yo it ain't funny
It's what you gotta do what you got to do
C'mon, can I get a Wu-Tang
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, it's on your brain
I get riggy diggy raw when it's time to get
On the dancefloor shotgun kill the shit
BLAOW, then you won't step to me
Thinking is he really raw as he said he'd be
If I wasn't really raw, standing here on the floor
You'd be like BOOOOO HE AIN'T NO HARDCORE
Niggas play like they live but won't survive
Jumpin up and down ticklin that jive when you ticklin gab
I'm an average man, G-O-D fan
Let it be known who's the champ, Wu-Tang Clan!
It's coming through and WU, boy it's bad too!
Throw your hands in the air, if you don't care

I'm gonna give it to ya, bayyybah, bayybah
Bayybahhhahahahahahahahahahah...




We used to sleep in the staircase, smoke weed in the staircase
Friday night got drunk, used to pee in the staircase
Hopin' a cop might slip, I'm never known to drop the clip
You copped the Fifth, nigga, I'll pop the fifth
I show no mercy, dunk like a bar of Hershey
Call my gun, Lil' Seymour, bitch, or Big Percy
A Dapper Dan fan, who will clap a man
For five grand of small bills, wrapped in a rubberband
Then lay up in a fat pair of titties, my bitch is so saditty
This is Dirt McGirt, ho, not P. Diddy
All we got in common is the money, the only thing I want is the money
You see my face on the wall of every precinct
Bitches keep your pussy decent, I'm juvenile delinquent
For guns that I creep with, they whisper, in secret
Only bitch that peepin', is the one that I sleep with, nih-huh!


Alotta niggas wanna dust me off
Bad bitches wanna suck me off
Rockafella dropped a million here
And Dirt McGirt back in the air
All my gangstas, where ya at?
Throw your guns up and make them clap
Tell me now, muthafuckas, you strapped?
And bitch betta have my money


Aiyo, the bitch better have your money and mine
Cuz if she don't, we both gon' double team that bitch from behind
And for them niggas outside screamin' that
'Somebody gotta die' shit, same dudes on the cop's dick
This is Tone, y'all niggas be frontin'
And most of y'all niggas don't got no guns
Borrowed your man's shit, how's that for a bum?
Dum-dums emptied out of pun son, so see man, see Ach' run
See spots over my Reebok's, cuz he got done
Cheap shots fell out his weak Glock and he got stung
My cheap gun is a gangsta's protein
Treat bitches with the utmost respect, like get 'em wetted
Tellin' to, drink the milk, boo, don't even wet it
This is Starky, I got a foot fetish, loot fetish
With the dust-head men, we got good credit




Notorious Glock buster, cap peelin', block hustler
Who slap hoes, who lack feelings
Black building, crack dealing, black villain
Had a taste for blood spillin', love stealin'
Any thing that twinkle bright to my eye sight
Many nights I used to stay up, at the twilight
And wonder to myself, if's there's a Heaven or Hell
Been alone in these streets, since eleven or twelve
On my own, I run buckwild in the West
A knucklehead nigga, used to sleep in my vest
Had no home, my Moms used to show me no lovin'
Burn the crib down, try'nna dry my shirt with the oven
Now I'm exiled, destined for penal
Hyperactive off the cocaine, got me senile
Back on the block, knowledge to build, knowledge to kill
Intent to put a dent in your grill with the steel






That Hublot, that king size Hublot


Ballin, dribble dribble shoot, swish
Ballin, do it like this, bitch
Ballin, steppin out of Saks, Fifth
Ballin, everyday is Christ-mas
Ballin, cash rules everything around me
Ballin, cash rules everything around me
Ballin, cash rules everything around me
Ballin, if you ain't gettin money get from round me (Ballin)


Yeah, uh, it's Crack... yeah, uh
No matter the weather, cant imagine it better
Got me lookin for Claire in the Bill Cosby sweater
Hundred bottles is better and they come in those cases
Im talkin peoples and places, we make it light up like Vegas
Ugh, I swear this bitch is dumb as shit
But her ass is even dumber
Now thats dumber and dumber; how to take off a summer
Took a flight out to Russia, we even flew out her mother huh
Fuck you niggas talkin bout?
At the Rucker I was about to bring Jordan out
They want to get Coke wet cause of my fan base
I used to get coke wet, I had to fan base




Uhh, T.S. whattup
(Hahahaha... you know I'm young and rich)
O Versace shades and some OG Js
Keep some OG blaze cause thats what got me paid
Rockin all this Wang, they look at me strange
Lots of DiamondAir when I'm on the plane
Ridin through the city me and Joe Crack
A pound of what Im puffin cost you four stacks
Niggas get it twisted cause my tour selled
What the fuck you think a nigga was before rap?
And my crib is new and I talk shit in my interviews
And my wife called my interludes, I don't break laws I just bend the rules
Got racks might spend a few
Couldnt walk a day in my shoes, got my own day you seen it in the news
Presidential smoke presidential Rolee'
Porsche 911, picture me rollin
Poppin champagne OG kush-a-holic
Put that in your phone, whether you call it




Yeah, uh...
Hahahaha, coke up in her bra
Nerve of you all a crip is a Colliseum
Olajuwon nigga I just Akeem
Worry about the bell, my niggas they got to free em
Champagne dreams and broke pockets
This why we call em niggas false prophets
Ballin, bitch I'm fuckin ballin
You can call me Spalding or maybe even Rawlings
Met her at the Esseses over there in New Orleans
She said she kinda shy but her body keep callin
Yeah they keep callin, I ain't even into them
Niggas jump ship, Pirates of the Carribean
Tell Wiz roll and smoke foggin my glasses
Niggas is my sons, I should claim em on my taxes
Look how big her ass is, I think she got the Nicki plan
(Ballin) but I ain't passin or dribblin





Chorus:

Bang your head... bang, your, head!
Bang your head... bang, your, head!

 Rzarector!


Yo I'm not the same that I was when I was younger
I roll with a Clan from a land, down under
Deep in the darkness, we strike you regardless
Of who? It's obvious! me... ha!
Surround in a burial ground appoint my death spot
I build my house on top of Salem's Lot
Front porch bloody, back yard, muddy
Like Amityville, my family kills
Thoughts of humanity, drove me to insanity
To all of my rivalries, I speak of profanity
Motherfuck this! Motherfuck that! Bang your, head!

Chorus


Here comes the killer with the Gravedigga sword, gimme room
Like devils in a Ouiji board I'm spellin' doom
Ever since six, throwin' mad stones
And sticks capture dips on the graveyard shift
Digging ain't a new phenom because my crew is on
Spots are blown like nuclear bombs
With the killer instinct, rhymes are in synch
B-B-B-B-Bang your head til it shrinks!
Midnight marauder, bodies are getting slaughtered
Bring a cross and a bucket of holy water
So stealing can't be controlled so mother fucking grave dig em'
Slide out your head stone stack up your body, just like a clepto
Let's go, to the graveyard plot
Count up the knots, on the bodies that got robbed
So bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!

Chorus x 2


Gatekeep!


Yo
I creep with the evil intent to represent
Of course, the night, is one with the dark force
The killer brigade, twelve o'clock starts the raid
Torches lit over your grave
Feel no pain though exposed to the raven
Deep in every step of blood like Wes Craven
Yo! I eject the fume that spells doom
The wickedest flow, sweep, ya up like a broom
Crept from the shadowy graves of Medina ha!
You're one stop away from the arena of death
Boom, bang! Here I am, the bezerk
The ruthless killer yo, I do work
Dark force is thick, mother fuckers for real
Here's a tale from the crypt, bang your head!

Chorus x 7




We are all obligated to pay off the debt
The national debt to these international banksters
That's - that's the bottom line
The bottom line is money
International banksters, gangsters
Yes, the banksters, banksters, banksters...


60 Second Assas', (black banksta'z) S.O.M. original (black banksta'z)
Wu Killa Beez, Sunzini, 12 O'Clock
Aiyo Knight, we bout to pop it off (John the Baptist, aiyo, we all)


Banksta, polish my shoes, tiltin' my hat
Rockin' my jewels, knowledge my booze, kissin' my gat
Aiyo, P, we need that walk child money
We be hungry, death to these niggas who take from me
I rep for the ghetto and cities, states and countries
White t-shirts and blue dungaries, smokin' on a ton of weed
Landin' on land that's overseas
In them S.U.V.'s and we polly for more g's
Who that sphinx in a mint jump suit, don't make me fling you
My two wizards, casino sisters, I'll have 'em drain you
It's painful to live in our shoes, hit you with jewels
All my banksta'z, get in the groove, rubbin' your ooze
Cop anchors like Italians and Jews, we bring it to you like
Prophecy news, for all ya'll Kay Slays, Flexes and Clues

We straight bankstaz (project fakers, hallway casinos)

So money never meant a thing to me, yo watch me go on, I got dough, shoppin' spree

Money never meant a thing to me, Killa Bee killed, Bedstuy
I'm a banksta, I keep money, with somethin' real for your grill
Money never meant a thing to me, packin' steel, fuck around
I got it growin' on trees, and it's this heat you will feel

Never you knew, not even more or less, half of my crew
Takin' your loot, beat you to you're black and turn blue
Watch us, Black Satin, we the banksta'z, bring it on through (Black banksta'z)
Fuck who you knew, son in your booth, my nizzle what the fuck you gon' do

Banksta'z (acres and mortages on houses)
We straight banksta'z (we add and multiply cash by the thousands)


We bank up with money bags and bring trucks made my Jaguar

Now got your dentals, through your dimpels, it's all so simple then

Resident out in Florida, platinum plaques on the corridor
We those banksta'z, that shit rhyme was gangsta
You may catch me down on Lakerson, pushin' the eighteen inch anchor
One hundred pennyweight boy, the black mini tank
Just caught a quarter mill' in cash, up from Citibank

Blow a nigga head off, if he sneeze or cough

Instrumental



{*sampled singer singing "Be a man"
And "bad situation man" throughout the song*}



Yeah it's Bobby Digital
Just floatin over the city
I came across this, this, this black man
He was talkin about (look down below)

Sure of yourself rising, prices of food skyrising
Foreign countries movin in USA, enterprising
Snatchin your mic then speakin, while you might be leaking
Then losin the luxury, average man be seeking

Thought he was so smart; ho's cheating, life fall apart
Fucking a hundred bitches couldn't mend a broken heart
Start as a soda jerk job, as a mail clerk
Fucked this white bitch in the office, got fired from work

Nine-to-five, government high taxes
Police dispatches, Beauracatics attackin black Asiatics
Resident with bad plumbing, Cocaine got my brain numb
And bitch complained about cumming, pussy stay humming;

$200 parking, summons out of state warrants
High blood pressure pills prescribed by Dr. Lawrence
Got me gaining weight, fuckin up my right kidney
Cousin raped at school, Eli Whitney

Peoples' eyes closed like envelopes by faux penmanship, with unpaid doctor bills
Framed got shot and killed, cops popping pills
Three pair cotton, steel closet, cabinet of no frills
Mo' bills, sister got evicted from Park Hill

Punch a hole inside the NARC wheels
My dogs bark, still carry dark steel
And unmarked bills, I'm from the uncut, dope, found on director's reels
Bobby Digital may switch back to Bobby Steels

Rusty .38's, bought rust inside the herb gate
So hungry, son, 'bout to shrink down to a bird's weight
Rash break out, where's the blue ointment, face-to-face appointments
Un-proudly in the church paid for annointment

Better checks don't come late
About to separate with her man
In the city, domestic violence escalates

Get a highest ratio in five years, the idea is to plant fear
Boy you slap yo' bitch, po-lice is there
To cuff you or snuff you, they might bust you
Cause your ho snatched your money up, didn't want to fuck you

We must learn to communicate, and unificate
Stop the black on black, hate on hate
White on white, black on white, put the love in love
I'm blunted up, blasted inside the strip club

Shorty wop, fifteen year old, all she needed was love
And mo' dough so she won't have to show her knotty afro
Collect call from my son denial, said he might blow trial, or cop out to 3 to 6
Bad situations, being a man is hard shit, something'll get trapped out I mean, yo

You got crack fiends in spots with vaccine shots
Black teens drop out of high school, white boys selling stock
With bonds they can't put their word on
20 years, shorty wop, pussy 'bout to swerve on

Up in the crib, new fridge, of dead pig
Two kids, from this older cat who looked like Calvin Coolidge
But got splat in his back last year, robbing this jew inside the diamond district
No one got convicted, heard they never found the biscuit

I'm booby trapped by the capitalists, trying to subsist
Sometimes happiness is hot grits and catfish, or a bowl of Cookie Crisp
I got harassed by this rookie bitch
Talkin' 'bout I couldn't put my feet on the fire hydrant to tie my kicks

$50 ticket, 'bout to strike and picket
And shout at the City Hall, motherfuck the wicked
And greedy, give to the needy
Down on my luck, about to grab a ouija board, that's when Bobby Digi seen me

Said, "Yo son, don't stress out over no one, learn the slogan:
Knowledge is half the battle, that's one to grow on
And don't be counterfeit
It's a bad situation just being a man, but we got to handle it"

Bad situation we in bein' a man




I'mma beat you down, to the ground
I'mma beat you down, fool
I'mma beat you down, to the ground
I'mma beat you down, dude
I'mma put my foot on yo ass
I'mma break you down, fool
I'mma beat your face with this bat
I'mma beat you down, boy
I'll beat you down, to the ground
I'll beat you down, yo
I'll beat you down, to the ground
I'll beat you down, fool


Yo, dark hallways, dead bodies, it's always
Rats and the O'Jays, songs from the old days
The Chi got a lotta bitter freeze and cold days
Hardly ever went to school, had a lot of snow days
Roll wraps on slow days, and it didn't take long
Before I figured out, these hoes pays
My uncle put me on, stuck, in his old ways
Leaving suckers shook, stuck, in them old graves
Ya'll know the repertoire, I got the peddle to the metal
Like a rebel, and I know just where the weapons are
Ghetto superstar, pushing a super car
A.M.G., C.L.K., C-Allah
Limousines, DVD's, TV's, bar
S.U.V.'s, O.G.'s who travel far
Black on black, double R, we hustle, pa
Stumble hard, bubble double on the boulevard




Freestyle king, top I'm going soar
I'm polishing off with a blood damn saw
Feed it to your tongue, you ain't hungry no more
Keep stabbing ya, until your jaw's ripped out
No mouth piece, nigga, your teeth is knocked out
I'mma keep swinging, I'mma keep swinging
I'mma keep dinging, I'mma keep stinging, ahhh
Jumping on the walls, spider never falls
Lighters in the air, writing on walls
I'mma beat you down, like you stole something from me
Cousing Sha might put something in your tummy!!!






We at the Downtown Cabinay, right across the street from the Coca Cobana
We have the midnight roof special going on
We have Choco on the wheels of steel
Slow it down for a minute Choco
Yo, Zig Zag on the M.I.C
We givin' a special tribute to Charlie Parker, here tonight
The midnight rooftop special
We gon' bring it like this, I want all ladies
Who came with their men, come on in
Get into sweety, and drink all night


Bebop, we walk with our hats on tilt
Pink and white silk, made of shoes on stilts
Dressed as the morning milk, plus, like the quilt
When we rock at the club, no blood got spilt
Where dime piece wizes, had they legs in the air
From being sprung by the swings, so they legs in the air
Long dresses, and they silk brassiere
Ya'll unloosen the twist, Rob came in the air


I rock the bebop, the bebop, the bebop
The bud-bud-a-budda-bidda bebop, bebop, somebody don't bopped bopped


The saxophone doctor can blow on any octave
Performance, of some of the world's greatest jazz rocker
From bebop to hip hop, back to bebop
Charlie Parker lids blow hot like boiling tea pot
From pull to press, not white and up tight
To blowin' horns, to walking with the bass up right
To having our crowns polished, and our face up right
To clean our neighborhood's and I play sometin' right




So we still groovin' wit it
Keepin' the flow poppin' here
We gon' turn the lights down a little low
Just hide the identity, yo, yo


The saxophone doctor can blow on any octave
Performance, of some of the world's greatest jazz rocker
From bebop to hip hop, back to bebop
Charlie Parker lids blow hot like boiling tea pot
From pull to press, not white and up tight
To blowin' horns, to walking with the bass that's up right
To having our crowns polished, and our face up right
To clean our neighborhood's and I play sometin' right




Bebop... hehehehe
Take it back, heh
Bebop..
Bebop..






Zig-Zag. Yo, check it. Eyo


Who could take a single buck, an empty cup, a stroke of luck
Fuck around and reconstruct it up to a million bucks
In God we trust, every part of us is marvelous
You Krusty Krab squad, ya'll will rust, ya'll ain't hard enough
Demolition expert, I exert through your network while the TEC squirt jerk
There's holes inside your sweatshirt
Through your apparel, through your blood, through your bone marrow
Precise with this mic device, slice your pie like Sbarros
You falling nigga, and you can't get up
You been stalling motherfucker now your ass is stuck
Brooklyn, Brownsville, baby stay with the Killer Hill crazy
Ankle strap above the boot, it conceals my three eighty
Are you running for this money money, hunting eggs like easter bunny
Geeks trying to beast upon me, freak I will eat a zombie
Calm and double while you jumping through these hurdles, silly rabbit
The race is always won by the turtle, mental machinery
Purple herbal mixed with that greenery
I dont write songs, grasshopper, I write sceneries
Everything aint what it seems to be, what it means to you it dont mean to me
Bzzzz, a sting from the killer bees


In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them them them, motherfucking Beez)
(Dropping them them them, motherfucking Beez)
(Dropping them them them, motherfucking Beez)
(Dropping them them them, motherfucking Beez)
Beez on 'em
Stings bitch
Bzzzz... BzzzzZZZzzz


I pass any test of litmus, I workout at 24 fitness
On the weekends, I sip Belvedere with that citrus
My dogs is vicious, exotic
Exotic nympho whore for the mistress
Life is good, I live every day like it's Christmas
Happy New Year, I does what the fuck I wanna do here
I splash that Gucci shit from the shirt to the shoewear
Trust the rings out, wife beater tee with the wings out
Long dick stamina, I fuck a bird til she sings out
La la la la, Bobby could convert Lady Gaga
Back to heterosexual, I'm classy like Impala
Plus I'm federal, when it comes to making dollas
Like Jigga nigga man, if you hear me then holla
Gold rings like the Green Lantern
You see me in the mean phantom
Pushing over there in Ohio, outside of Canton
Or maybe in the grotty, rugged projects of Staten
Tall redbone in my shower, she looking like Paula Patton


In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them them them, motherfucking Beez)
(Dropping them them them, motherfucking Beez)
(Dropping them them them, motherfucking Beez)
(Dropping them them them, motherfucking Beez)
Beez on 'em
Stings bitch
Bzzzz... BzzzzZZZzzz




Give me the cue


Skip the introduction proceed to lip function
The junction get rushed by some grimy people busting weed
Splatter your melon like some Attica felons
Use a firearm good, Bloods go for heart swelling
Insert the spasm, yes the dirty herb has him
Thoroughbred thugs insert the fantasm
Verbal smarts, spark the word, visit my scripture
Exotic wine, holding nine Picasso pictures
When the rhyme pivot you now, limit your chance
Bodyguard the lyric with unlimited stance
Words seem to zing on down to Beijing
When we touch down, would you crown renowned kings


There's no honor amongst thieves
Street pharmaceutical stack like Genovese
The Four Devils tempt madmen but not these
We profound hardcore sound to MCs, thumbs down, prepare
Killa bees it be warfare, this the year
Niggas gotta take you off of here, hold the square
If we go there we go gritty and spread fear
Through this rap city, call the mayor
My razor sharp darts be like cold stares
The smell of fear make my nostrils flair, truth or dare?
Ask yourself can you compare to these niggas in the hood
Johnny B. Goode or he be gone yeah
The struggle goes on, you've been warned
PLO from here to Lebanon, how many bomb
Must we drop in the Ninety-Now?
Walk a mile in my shoes, get the street news from Meth-Tical


Glocks'll be spitting, you gots to be kidding
Aiyo kid you gots to be kidding
Or Glocks'll be spitting
You gots to be kidding yo


It's common sense how I master my circumference, you dense
I get locked the fuck up, released on my own recognizance
Can't be judged, young bloods bust back like scuds
Wu-Tang hovers one thousand notches above
MC level, yo, I stay highs like treble
Foes who oppose get plucked like rose petals
Arresting and holding, penetrate forbidden regions
Wack MCs only lasting one season
The morale was low at the corral
Adjective pronouns had no style, your weak proposal
Aim for the official, initial is Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah
All that other bullshit ain't permissible
Annual increase of the Wu-Tang Manual
Handles to keep all this Hip Hop shit tangible
Illegible, every egg ain't edible
My tracks remain 'Unforgettable' like Ol' Nat Cole
Got to catch this paper to buy Shaquasia a glacier
Nebuchadnezzar skyscraper
Understanding the continents of Africa and Asia
And free the Black Man from enslaved labor, Wu-Tang


The weight of the fam is on our back and we can't fall
Victim to this long hall of fame, meaning nothing
We came to punish the glutton with a substance
That can't be contained, Wu-Tang


Motherfuckers
We be seeing y'all asses when we walk up in the club
Y'all all in the back
Scared to speak, we speak cause you scared
Punk motherfucker, we know what time it is


All you been seeing is upsets in the boxing shit, right
It's like come on man
This nigga fucked up motherfucking Whitaker
Dang, he caught Whitaker
He caught Whitaker a long time ago
Mike got touched
Then Mike got touched by Holyfield
Hey Mike's, Mike's gonna forfeit this fight
He ain't fighting McDermit
He ain't fighting
Nope
Whattup
You talking bout he, what he, what he, what he did
Told them he cut his eye, in sparring


Stella D'oro wrap breadsticks, David Berkowitz
Einstein birthed a hit, now nurture it
M.G.M. front row seat tonight, no gems
Purify, cleanse, ran into some beef up in the men's
Fix your sawed off, Wu-Tang tore me off the cross
All you saw was white meat, skin hanging off
These is words from the Arch Bishop, some call it six up
The Betty Crocker Marvel cake, snakes will miss a
Wax janitor, black Jack Mulligan from Canada
Slam dance, tarantula style, you's a fan of the
Monopoly king, Slavic poetry
Carnegie Hall's off the hook, let's push through the armory
Mack truck hitting soloist, Soul Controllers
Behold of the thousand teeth fist, swift and boneless


You know cause Wu-Tang is invincible, you know what I mean
It's Wu-Tang Forever God
We gonna get down with that W
You gonna get down with that W
That's that Wu, that's that Wisdom
That's the Wisdom of the Universe
That's the truth, of Allah, for the Nation of the Gods
YouknowhatI'msayin
We breaking egg through these days God
YouknowhatI'msayin
We got the fucking way
We got the medicine for your sickness
Out here, ya knowhatImean
I was telling Shorty like
Yo Shorty, you don't even gotta go to summer school
Pick up the Wu-Tang double CD
And you'll get all the education you need this year
YouknowhatImean
Their poisoned minds can't comprehend this shit
Word man it's Wu-Tang Forever God
Niggas can't fuck with these lyrics God
YouknowhatI'msayin
Knamean
Oh hell no, none of this shit
C'mon man -- beats, lyrics man, y'all niggas
Niggas can't even understand half this shit
I think niggas ain't gonna figure it out til the year Two-G
(Wax niggas ass for free or fee) Word
Yo, you know what
The next Wu-Tang album ain't even coming out until 2000
YaknowhatImean
That's just gonna come back with a comet
You hear, we gonna bring a comet
Check for that shit in the millenium
YouknowhatImean? So, yo, y'all niggas man
Be the resurrection
The Gods is here man
Born Gods is here



Let me give you some real shit for a second
Yo, listen...

Five hundred years of tears, we still here
Standing strong, the only thing that we fear
The reflection in the mirror, the hate is deep
It's been this way since Willie Lynch made the speech
Divide and rule got us all by the balls
The referee's cheatin', but we playin' by the rules
Even after all the rape and the killing
We still let the same man educate our children
There's been no apology, we still forgivin'
And he's got the cheek to portray us as the villain
Look across the globe at the way we are livin'
The darker the skin, the realer the condition, no coincidence
We built the whole western world for free
And what thank you did we get? To be hung from trees?
We been whipped, been stripped of our truth
But we still standin', a tree without roots
Black rose from the concrete, the petals is damaged
But surely you see the beauty of what just happened
What don't kill you, make a nigga strong, that's a fact
And we've been abused for so long, you do the math




Bobby.. Bobby.. Bobby.. Digital.. Digital.. Digital..
Bobby.. Bobby.. Bobby.. Digital.. Digital.. Digital..


{*makes that DOODOODOODOO noise over woman's voice*}
Bobby Bobby.. yo..
Belly of the beast, belly of the beast
Yo, yo

The murderous assault catapault lyrics from the vault
The exalted chief annointed, flows double jointed
Ointment of disappointment, opponents can't pinpoint it
The moment of microphone mystics, merciless meticulous
Verses disperse the tricks from the surface
Expose those who real and whose nervous
I'm killin your urges, I'm determined
To inject my serum, to your eardrums
Then swell them up, it's the merciless
Galactic tactics, of microphone harassment
Impregnates your brain to give your head piece contractions
Rebirth the thought, Wu-Tang can't be played short
We import and export, uncut dope from New York
Like Nate who sold weight, between Monroe and Gates
Half-ounce to big cake slice to his lowest price rate
Had a deathcase at the weekend when his cousin used to freebase
A high speed chase and Gods waved in his face

B-O-B-B-Y
Trapped up inside the belly of the beast got to break loose
Bobby unleashes, the craziest shit
Fuck the world fuck the peace it's..
B-O-B-B-Y
Trapped up in the belly of beast, we gotta break loose
Bobby unleashes, fuck the bloodshed
Yo slugs to your head, you won't make it past me

Hell.. I'm gettin sick
I bugged the fuck out when DMX fucked Taral Hicks
Make me wanna jerk my dick, jerk jerk jerk..
Jerk jerk, and bust the fuck off on the next ho's skirt
E.M.I., I'm wild like G.I., Joe - Magnum P.I
Or niggas from C.I., on the B drinkin Knee-High
Alpha Phi, Sigma guy, NeoGeo, fuck the C.O. or the P.O
I'm wild like the Lion Leo
It's a K.O. fuck a J-O.. B
I'm an emcee, D-M-D, W-T-C, B-C, G-P, REC posse's all in me
Live on TV.. you see the B.. O-B-B.. Y.. D-I.. G-I.. T.. A-L
Can never go to jail by NY..PD
F.I.C, try to hold my money hostage
From my last deposit was one mill'
Bobby Steels gettin ill

Still, trapped up in the belly of the beast
Fuck the world, fuck the beast
Bobby unleashes, masterpieces
When I'm trapped in the belly of the beast
And bring the war, and say fuck the beast!
What should I do?
{*makes that DOODOODOODOO noise*}

Mess with my brother going back to Attica
He the nucleus, I'm the reactor
Wolf scarred, battle star galactica
Solid gold, I'ma fold and package ya
Repzar nigga I'm a rhythm trafficker
Up against the wall, I'ma sandwich ya
All-star pro, you's a amateur
Damager, bandager, examiner, stamina
I love the fame, I love the props
I'm from the drug game, I hug the block
There's the stage, I'm ready to rock
Yo RZA hit me up when the mic gets hot



 X2
Set it up, I tear it down
Wet it up, I shake the town
Place your bet, I'ma lay it down
Ready Set, I'ma take the crown


I got the respect when I hit the South

Computer programmer, just click the mouse
I want fifty K hits nigga watch the bounce
Now to the ounce, I'm keying notes
Ya'll beating niggas, ya'll pumping soap
I'm eating niggas, I'm so cutthroat
Watch a one-armed nigga just cut the dope



 X2

I'll be right there X8




Ay yo, it's the BET Cypher
The Man with the Iron Fists edition
Film out November 2nd yo
But right now check out these new hot weapons right here
Driicky Graham, A$AP Rocky, Angel Haze, Childish Gambino and Joey Bada$$
C'mon, splash em son


I came here with one intention to kill this
I'm talking head in my hands, mouth on that drill ish
I be on that wired insane, ultimate trill shit
And there is not a soul that can see me
Like I'm not real trick
Listen up niggas I'm tired of you lames
I'm hungry and you looking like entire food chains
And uh, it's to the point that I ain't even got to try hard
Spittin' like a lake in hell, but bitches like my God
Plus niggas flicking lenses on me like a tripod
'Cuz they know there's only one eye, like cyclops
You know I beat 'em to the count, to the points love
I swear I never even lost in a coin toss
So bow down mothafuckas, if you talking deep shit Ill out drown mothafuckas
Somebody find my rocker cause I'm literally off it
I'm in the murder business I just spit you bitches a coffin


Yo, til the day I die, I be puffing lye
Fuck the world, fuck it dry
Tell them government spies I won't cover my eyes
Won't cower, won't move, cause I don't move like a coward
Knowledge is power and the flower of life is ours
Get as high as ours, maybe you can see the towers
Scour your dirty mind and maybe you'll unleash the power
We all got the potential in our body and soul
Probably you know I found mines right through the pencil
Started bodying flows, but fuck that
This be the preview of primeval hip-hop retrieval
I hold illegal like them coppers hold weasels to Squeal
This one for my people, heading to the top, no re-do
Thinking up evil but see no evil just be Knievel
You can't be this good they just made me better
They told me cheese at the cams and they made me cheddar
And the green only made me better
See, God made three Bigs, 2 Pacs but he only made one era, The Era


Swear you guys slipping like some ice on a bridge
Since diapers and bibs
The light skin has been quite nicer than how Mike was to kids
Cypher rhyming, Rikers Island, spending nights with the pen
Either that or cyber-Skyping with a dyke and her friend
She telling me, she gon' take my cock to her lips
Suffice to my wish, saliva and recycle my kids, gulp
I'm the best, its hard to lose hope
I'm spitting rappers out like orange juice pulp
And looking in the mirror like aren't you dope
You so clean motherfucker you should hardly use soap
Something sinister, raps that minister
You mortals don't want combat, I'll block and finish ya
I'm seriously dope, I'm crack, I'm venomous
And you are seriously poked in your crack by ministers
Eww, these days rappers on my TV
Are braggers about their swagger rocking karats off of Ebay
But I ain't tripping, I like groupie women
Who be sendin' chills up your spine when you see they booty switching
Fast cars with the kufi missing, that's top off
Pop off, I'm with my dawgs like Stewie Griffin
Niggas hear me, be like ooh he be ripping
And if your girl see me she catch that Driicky spank me, do me feeling
Over the money I be pooky twitching
And honestly about the beef I gives a fuck what who be Twittin'


Still good with a pen, no Joe Paterno
I count Ninja Turtles, my cash flow concern them
Gambino you meet him, repping east side of the A hard
Got the Black AMEX, I gotta pull the race card
Niggas move that Kreayshawn, naw I don't carry mine
Why the game fucked up like my hairline
Ay girl, you ever smoke a bowl out with Kid Cudi?
You ever gotten D like you don't study?
Rap game in the fast lane, with a gas tank
Filled with half of these trash lames
I have to say I'm such a Joey's last name
Bino boy, why you spit so mean
Why the flow so rich girl, them sweet sixteens
He on BET and he got White people problems
"Like, Whole Foods doesn't have the juice I like so I have to go to, you know
Trader Joe's and have it shipped to me"
Victory, history
More G than a kid's movie, Royalty


My name is Rock in the new drop, my destiny's to be the new Pac
That nigga Rocky gotta die, he too hot
Its dead on, must've been tripping and stepping in heron'
Cause Im cripping the lead on
Im getting forensics twisting your head on
Traffic, mad clips, caskets, pass this, ashes to ashes
That shit, backwards, tactics
Bitches only like me for my status
Living ghetto fabulous and Im still acting ratchet
Twenty-four karats, no dressing with my salads
Nigga with the Patch kids, steady talking cabbage
Got a chick red like radish, have it
Bitches think they bad til I drop them like habits
No one in this cyph' has swag like I do
Church with this verse, I'mma hit em with the gospel
Ever since a baby, ask my old lady
My first four words was, fuck you, pay me




Yeah
Rap City Tha Bassment
(smack that, we gonna smack that...)
Rza!


Big Tigger putting it down with common sense
His new album called "Birth of a Prince"
You gon' cop that, it's in the stores black
And don't act whack, or you'll get clapped back
It's Big Tigger and my man Rza-Resurrector
Putting it down, I'll be like the freestyle perfecter
Got my girl T-Losting from Boston
But we all Yankee fans and of course n'...


It's the Resurrector, yo I'm sipping off the golden nectar
I may chew you down like Hannibal Lecter
So respect to the Inspectah Deck'star
You know my check'sta, I'm microphone check
Might just wet you
I blink cataracts from 40 feet back
And I make rap beats over 43 tracks, yo
Who wear fleece, in a Gucci linen
I get drunk with the cops, I'm boning police women


Yeah, you how me and my crew bang
We do things like Wu-Tang, so what'cha you wanna do
How you want it? - we gonna give it to you raw
And you can check us everyday, right here, live at 4
But tomorrow, no, you won't see me
Cause we airing the BET awards live at 3
Holla back now, it's Big Tig' doing it
With the freestyle, so come back now


It's Black Entertainment, yesterday I made my arrangement
And the judge: "you know I can't budge, because I'm thick like fudge"
The black ghetto Prince, leave no metal prints
I may push through your hood on a back of an elephant
Police escort, gat in my Jansport knapsack
Plus and I just left court
And I was late for my court date
Cause I was up all night boning strawberry shortcake


Yes, we're keeping it critical
It's Big Tigger with my man the Rza AKA Bobby Digital
It's going down right now, putting it down for all Shaolin
And my peoples up town
My girl T-losting repping Boston, I said that before
But yes I'm still flossing
Rza come on, and shut it down
I'ma turn it to you over right now


Yo check I'm not senile, meanwhile it's back to the freestyle
You wanna get burnt, you get turned, like the turn-style
I'm not a burnt child, I gotta firm smile
I gotta glow makes the halls be like yo
Washers on the Wheels of Steel, Bobby Digital
Used to called Bobby Steels, Park Hill, Shaolin Island
BET - Black Entertainment TV, where you could see me:
Little past 3
For some it's channel 48 for some it's channel 24
I don't know it's up to you, whatever territory you're from
Just knock on the door, Wu killer bees son
Yo we're bringing it raw - you know how we do


Album in stores


Album in stores it's "The Birth of a Prince"
And there been no man born like this since 2000 BC
Y'all better be happy to see me, I'm like Christ
I'm like Godzilla coming over mountain Fiji
Ohh it's your boo, what's up mommy, hey I'm happy to be in TV
I'm just zoning out




The slums of a big town as packed with drama and danger as the squalling street of some native quarter. In the heart of this melting pot of crime stands an oasis, where one man struggles against the forces that turned his loved one to lives of violence and shame


He spares no one
He was forgotten, but he was someone
So beware of the stare of the Ghostface Killah
So beware of the stare of the Ghostface Killah


Beware, son, I got the stare of Medusa
With the rope tied around your neck, it won't get looser
I might shoot ya, make your ass an example
You can't fuck with Tone Starks, and not get trampled
Get hunted like a rat in a field, I hate rats
Hate fake ass niggas that love to set traps
Murder the don, I'm back with a bird on my arm
Back to pillage, I rock a live grenade as a charm
I want bodies, DeLucas, spread into the waters
I want mothers and sons, I wanna murder they daughters
Revenge, all I see is blood in my eyes
Like the rise of your worst nightmare come alive
Ghostface Killah, let's see who's gonna survive


He spares no one
He's not forgotten, cause he was someone


Yo, look away, don't stare into the eyes of a killer
Metal lungies, junkies, nigga, I pack the nine millers and thrillers
Bulletproof robes and wave caps
Revenge mode, nigga, you know Ghost gon' stay strapped
Hunt 'em down in alphabetical order
Each person that crossed me, watch the man slaughter
The butcher, the baker, the torturer, the taker
I'mma send you right back to your maker
A few extra holes, miss your soul sold to the devil
It's the rebirth of slick brought back as a rebel
I'm immortal, gonna kill generations of your fam
You tried to loathe my legacy away, but I stand stronger
GFK, the pain prolonger


He was a lonely man, they killed him
Cause they didn't understand
Though his spirit possesses a rhythm
As the words on this record unleashes the Ghostface Killah

Eh-yo, man, fuckin'..
Mothafuckin' Billy, man
Yeah, man
That mothafucka, man, just called me and shit
From fuckin', uh, some county jail, man
Down South or some shit
He's mothafuckin' crazy
I thought that nigga was comin' here next week too and shit
But I guess he went down South with them fuckin' white boys and shit
You know he love hangin' with them white boys and shit


Yo, yo, yo, Billy
He sniffed dope and swallow acid, took gulps of colt classics
Smoked hashes, tote plastic Glocks and low jackets
Cross country, cousin Billy with forty monkeys
Twenty white honkys, Harley Davidson bike junkies
In a convoy escapin' from Rosco P. Co
And those four redneck cops who had Rodney in a sleephold
The SWAT team, U.S. army shock team
The snipers who shot King, infrared dot beams
Aimed at windshields, gas tanks and wheels
From the bank they yanked the mil, hot lead and stainless steel
Shot through the helmets, cracked heads like Hellmanns jars
Ripped through the roofs and blew the hood off the car
A.T.F., F.B.I., D.E.A., chopper in the sky
Eye witness news on standby
Bill Beutel, it was Mit from the metly
Mint leaf tea dipped in P.C.P., hit to the head like a D.D.T
Hard on the gut like Mc D.L.T
C-cipher punks put the A.P.B
On these destroyers who was drunk off the J&B
Ran up in A&P, hit the safe at P&C
Documentary on A&E, eight P.M. E.S.T
Five P.T., the ho tapin' on V.C.R
Three victims shot, one was saved by C.P.R
Fuckin' Billy be wildin'
Like Robert L. Lee or Stonewall Jackson
He always out for action
I was at an eighteen hole golf course relaxin'
When I received the collect call, BOODOODOODOO
Collect call from cousin Billy


(Eh-yo, Bobby, I'm in trouble)
Yo, what's goin' on, cousin?
What the fuck, man?
(Listen, yo I need fifty thousand)
Oh sh--, eh-yo, Kinetic
Check it out, nigga said he need fifty fuckin' g's Son
(Listen, yo, we got into a fight
In the bar, shit was just crazy)
Eh-yo, I heard you was fuckin' with the white boy Tommy again
Takin' that acid, nigga
(Yeah, oh yeah, we chillin' though
I just need you to come get me, for real)
No problem, son
Yo, I'll send my nigga Kinetic down to get you and shit (Aight)
Aight, there it is




Tempted by the sins of life, the pleasures of lust
With wild imaginings that you can't discuss
Oh, the flesh is weak, it's a struggle for peace
It's a daily conflict between man and beast
We strive for God and a better tomorrow
Still suffering from the unforgettable sorrow
Repent from thy sins, son and walk ye straight
Stop talking all that trash boy and talk ye straight
Afflicted by the pressures of life at every vital point
Still, I wouldn't give an oint'
Or flinch an inch or pitch a pinch
Off the pie or every try to try your wench
Confronted by the devil himself and stay strong
You think you can take the King now meet Kong
Strong as the base of a mountain, there's no counting
How many MCs have sprung from our fountain
Fifty thousand year process to make this combination
I'm not giving mine away to Satan
Although I know that he's awaiting
To get a hold of my biochemical equation
I'ma slip him son, I'ma dip him, son
When I catch the drop on him, I'ma clip him, son
Fifty thousand year process, to make this combination
99 elements, biochemical manifestation
I'm not giving mines away to Satan
Although, I know that he's awaiting
I'ma slip him son, I'ma dip him, son
When I catch the drop on him, I'ma clip him, son


Bet ahk, straight to the head with the pet rock
At least til I can get from out this booth, it's like a sweat box
Trade a few bars of head nodding, throw us a stack
Pay him and it's sewed up like thread and bobbin bonus pack
Invest in the first B-boy kid show
Live off skid row with jive talking negros
He wear his beard like a frizzly haired grizzly
And kept his appearances exquisitely rare, where is he?
Is he in the backyard or on your front porch
Or standing in the corner of the club with the blunt torched
You're soft, they say he rhyme like he starving
And sold odds and bodkins to old gods and goblins
Golly, I'm just a pest and your worst best friend
Who mend and rip space-time fabric like polyester blend
Not a hobby for no knobby-kneed lesser men
Or sloppy like the rest of them, they probably need estrogen


Yo, yo, drunk or sober, son, don't lose your composure
Semi off the Remy, mixed with Henny, Moet demi'
Underneath the passenger seat, son, tuck the semi'
Israeli issued automatic black pistol
The cop with the flashlight chew gum as he whistle
Tapped on the glass, roll it down fast
License, registration addressed to your lab
They made insurance, the reason why I pulled you over
Cuz the way you were swerving, sir, you can't be sober
Have you been drinking? Breathe into the breathalyzer
Get out the car, please, follow this exercise, sir
Put one finger on your nose, now from heel to toe
Walk in a straight line, ten paces, down the road
My homeboy Kano, used to do the mashed potato
Or cartwheels and then spin out like a tornado
They used to chase him, right; but son, he would always shake em
Then come and puff bowls and make beats inside my basement
Drunk or sober, never lose your composure
Stress on the brain cause pain and stomach ulcers
If you can't understand, then come closer
We civilized the uncivilized like we supposed to
Drunk or sober, never lose your composure
Mic in your hand, black man stand as a soldier
Stress on the brain, cause pain and stomach ulcers
If you can't understand, then come closer




What? What you want?
Represent represent represent
Yeah, represent, check it out check it out


Yo mama don't wear no drawers!
I saw her when she took them off!
Standing on the welfare line
Eating swine trying to look fine, with her stank behind
You can ask the bitch and she'll tell ya fast
Meth-Tical got STYLE with his nasty ass


Are you ready, to face the consequences and suffer?
I even tell ya momma you ain't shit, motherfucker
Bring it, and let that killer bee kid sting it
And rep-resent, it's like heads up a brick, when I swing it
Get lost, I break you off something
I'm pumping, like a Reebok, with a pump
From the jump and, you was nothing
Bet you thought you fucking clan had ya back but they was fronting
Smoking dirt blunts and fucking nasty sluts and
You just a naked gun without the bullet, what you busting
Get your ship sunken, fucking with a drunken
Master disaster at any rap functions


Just an echo, yoo-hoo
We be living in the valley yoo-hoo
It may be difficult to bring back
Sweet memories of you
And you can even ask your crew
Bet your bottom dollar that they tell ya fast
Meth-Tical got STYLE with his nasty ass


Who said the Wu-Tang Clan? Was it you or your man?
You wanna point the finger, I'll bring ya
36 chambers, be out, you'se in danger
Let me pull your brain out your ass with a hanger
Didn't momma tell ya not to talk to a stranger?
Now ya got ya neck, in the noose, of the strangler
Just recline, keep the Meth in mind
I'll even test the knuckle check on the hands of time
What? And I'll be more than glad to bust that ass
All up and down the block, the street, that ave
Whatever, smoking on a Spike Lee joint
Hey I'm Mo' Better, I'm hoping niggas get the point
Cause they could never, stop the veteran, word to God
When I'm severing the head of a mental vegetarian
The Method, at the weed gate, with a long line of credit
If you desire fire, I be the first to set it
Off, flame on like the Human Torch
Fantastic Four for all the fans in the store
You can eat it all and it'll tell you fast
Meth-Tical got STYLE for your nasty ass


94 baby, word up, recognize, recognize
Wu-Tang killer bee
The RZA and the Method MZA
Raider Ruckus, where you at?




He is not even worthy to die, by your hands
And wicked hands, ahhh
But with him, will not bring him peace
My professor
*screams*
Damn!


A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
And it ain't gon' be pretty, now let me paint the picture
So we can do it hit style, by whipping out the slammers
Or we can go medieval, with spear, shanks and hammers
Now anyway you want it, a bitch is gonna get ya
You playing Daredevil, I'mma be that bitch Elektra
Now you can't even measure, you such a pretty gal
A dropkick from me feeling like a fifty cal'
A bitch is gonna get ya, this really could get dirty
Box cutter in heels, seals thirty thirties
You wanna call my bluff, ya'll nowhere near tough
My shank turn furry Kangols to some earmuffs
Make 'em all scatter like roaches
A bitch is gonna get ya, now who is that approaching
Somebody trynna see me, these jokers miss the memo
They bet about face, 'fore they going out the window
A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
I'm jumping in your whip like that crazy ass Hitcher
Sliced ear to ear like F.U. haters
Except you ain't getting saved by no Caped Crusaders
Saying to yourself, yeah that bitch crazy
Think Green River Killer mixed in with John Gacy
Your hits don't phase me, they make me laugh
Now watch me go smack a bitch with my period pad
I said a bitch is gonna get ya, but ya'll already knew that
I catch another body every time I write a new rap
How many of ya'll can do that, you know it's only one of me
All of ya'll for cop shifty, ya'll just some wannabes
A bitch is gonna get ya, you know a bitch coming
It's not T-Pain, when you hear that thing humming
Fully automatic, coming right out the spinner
Call it lead lipo, make that ass look thinner
A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
A bitch is gonna get ya, like Wendy with the gossip, or even Miss Info
With all her little topics, little blogging
Yeah, ya'll all know, trynna match O stacking all that Harpo dough
That chick with McCain, since Hilary out the picture, how can I put it bluntly
A bitch is gonna get ya, Digga Digga
Say peace when you see her, that ready to beat her, shit gets uglier
A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
A bitch is gonna get ya, a bitch is gonna get ya
A bitch is gonna get ya, bitch I'm gon' get ya
Bitch I'm gon' get ya...






Burn something kid


Yeah, youknowwhatImsaying, let me tell you something man
Through the man's mind, God
He see his elevation, God
See through his mind, he see his elevation, God
See this where he begin to know that where he come from
See some people don't have no direction, God
Because they don't know the science of they self
See the signs of life is the signs of you
All the elements that it took to create you
Everything that's in the universe, God
That's created the universe, God, is just within you
You see what I'm sayin?
And that's the mind that you can't see
Don't you know if a man could take and flip himself inside out, God
He'll fall out and die if he sees the shit that goes on...inside?


So you mean to tell me I'm the creator of all this right here?


You the creator of all this
Because all these things must happen, it must take place
See people go back in the day, God
They say: one man, one woman, Adam and Eve, there ain't no such thing
Everything you see always has been and always will what be
Regardless the womb or what, it's got to be


Hit me, hit me, hit me, I don't wanna hear nothin
Word Up
Got to pay
Yeah, it's like that right?
Blow his back out, make his shoes worth


A-yo, this shit be off the noggin rock it
Whatever cock block it
Cat get blown, who own this street corner
Foreigner hesitate to rock a Hummer
Navy Seal top runner, rhyme this summer
For real, marinating nigga's skating
Debating waiting style flowingly relating
Fine line switch it on ya, like venetian blinds
The mission is mine, fabulous king I divine
Titanium Hydro collide though
Yo dun dun polly this conjunction, son one
Slang doctor, medicated kids pay it
Say it, these niggas in affect dun, stay rap related
Cassette rhymer, 5-G consigner, line for liner
Poet designer, sharp like Linus
Mic of the year award, fly gear award
Them niggas over there be analyzing with one sword
Get bent, pay the rent, plus still we invent
Nuff shit to get your whole team crazily sent
Now all I need is a half gallon of weed
Proceed, to bust this mic dick and make three seeds
Then max out like two Ac's inside the parking lot
Son bark a lot and get his team hit in the dark a lot
What now blow, clicking like a calico
Gold, Maximillion, one love keep it real yo


Yo, hit me for these Tommy Hill, ice-rocking niggas
Peace, this summer's mines, I blow the biggest
Back up off me, while I grab my dick and hold the Heini
Park the Blue 600, Wally kings is right behind me
Tackle clubs, never rock Lugz, I'm way above
These mics is like the Golden Gloves verses spark plug
Its like the pennant, seminar's the play-off
Start the J off like Cochran got OJ off
This specialist who eyeballed your mistress necklace
Perpetuous, this curly-head kid's treacherous
Let go the eggo, so we can dip dip dive like Lego
Throw on can-can, eat that plus this instrumental
Ah shit say Stark-ologist
Starks-ologist, fried fish halibut
Pull out the bull horn, let's celebrate like Kunta was born
We elbowed our way inside Loud and got on
I played the building, burn a branch and get filled in
Like Pilgrims G-in' Pepridge farms from out of millions
Who wanna rhyme, who wanna challenge the swordmans
That rock that fisherman hat like Gorton's


I hold down the place, no shots to the face
Elite Special force no religious style faith
The melting pot boil gun shot drama soil
Gamble when I scramble handle hot pots of oil
Manhandle pain killing erect my hidden
Streets made me potent put your 9-6 bid in
Vampire curse disperse on each verse
Swim in black water, act slaughter through my earth
You're hit by my element Great Wall of China
Mountain peak holds the globe like vagina
Measure on my mic stand, molecule and strand
Finger rolling rhythm ride the horse one hand
Golden Eye, Spy vs. Spy, guilty of suspicion
Chess boxer, mic in dead body position
40 oz. Ciga-art, three verse invention
Divine universal black man representing
Similar to pure, rhyme blowing out the pore
Battery in the back, keep me charged for the raw
I'm bred type thorough, pistolero gun hero
Renaissance rebel chatter-boxing your barrel
Fully woven Beethoven, hit you on a humble
Hard enough to hurt you, chastise my rap styles
Lock down, for this curfew




BLACK MAMBA!


Uh huh huh.. Black Mamba!
Uh huh huh.. Black Mamba!
Uh huh huh.. Black Mamba!
Uh huh huh.. Black Mamba!


Yo unbreakable steel sword swingin', face the Black Mamba
Deadly Vipers, squeeze ya life out like anacondas
In the story, off wit ya head, the scene is gory
Single-edged steel blade designed by Hattori
Hanzo. You see the signature above the handle?
Try to strike out, you get ya arm dismantled
Chief of the Yakuza's wicked like Medusa
With Crazy 88's too, 'bout to meet ya maker


Ol' Dirty Bastard swordplay
Dirt McGirt be pickin' up skirts on 4th and Broadway
Japanese bitch be suckin' my dick
Puerto Rican hoes be lickin' my split
California Mountain Snake on the bed
Be givin' my head while I'm countin' my cake, crushin' up an 8th
Of that snow white shit, in the Pussy Wagon not hittin' the brakes!




Baaaaaamm.. hidden swordstyle hits, I wish
A nigga would test the Black Mamba, in a spit like the coma
Fill his Copperhead with the hollow tip lead
Yo.. who wanna dance with the fertile lands' deadly state?
Cottonmouth sticky from the Af' gooey
Blowin' smoke through the Viper Pit
Hold a listener tight, mic constrictor
Words from the theater, swift as Krishner






*sounds of fighting*
Stupid fool, you're forcing me to kill you!


Yeah, you know how it go
Fresh from the stationary hall of justice
Real rhyming, real movement, real life
Word up, we just chilling, ten bottles of Krug on the wall
Youknowhatimsaying? Straight up, for real
Yo, RZA, talk to these niggas, man, let's go, man, for real
Yo, Rah, what up? Let's go, yeah, gangsta shit, groovy shit
Raw shit, secret indictment shit, yeah
Secret indictments, be careful, niggas
For real, let's go


You better get that money, no matter, what you do
You gotta get that money, and represent your crew
And keep it true


As reaper stay sprayed, still niggas is smoked
Four in his pocket, a diamoned up chain and some coke
Champion hood, the goodies in a brown bag, by the radiator
Near the cookies and the bundles of dope
Fishscalers, I live in elevators and gross
All this paper, profit make her lay there and post
With them Adidas that Bruce wore, stay in the juice bar
All I know if you saw me, you thought I was broke
Black, yo, I been hustling since niggas was busting guns
And scuffling, and jumping niggas over some coats
We play the S&S rooftop, Latin Quarter, Polo popes
Who hung out with all the Eighthers and GOAT's




Yo RZA, you crazy man
This that Black Mozart shit, right here


Yo, I used to scramble hard, radio strapped, to the handlebars
Fifty deep, in the lobby large, rocking camouflage
Dark Caesar holding my nuts, played the building front
Fifth of Henny, throw a little snow in the blunt
Just growing up, schooled by O.G.'s, holding O's and up
Daily new drama unfold, they popped 'em over, what?
It's so rough, nobody know him, so what?
Aiyo, the money's close by, homey, show me the stuff
Borough hopping, copping bricks, bags, burners and kicks
City slickers, circling the strip, working them tricks
Like friday night cruise in the Coupe, new valor suit
Fruit flavored kicks, taking flicks out in 40 Deuce
Farmer jeans, hammer swing, tucked in the loot
How they hit Miss Fisher, they was busting at suit
Up in 54, underground, parrot and Q
Made man with the grey shams, wrapping the boo
Stay flam, every day, fam, stacking my loot
Eighty grams in the cake, bam, packages flew
Sipping passion fruit, Alize, in back of the Ooh


We soldiers, boy, we soldiers
Bake cakes, hundred dollar bill holders
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers
Bighead, I thought I told ya
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers
Bake cakes, hundred dollar bill holders
Bighead, I thought I told ya
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers






Hard days of work
You had a hard day at work baby
I want you to sit down, relax
While I soak you in my mentals
Backrub style, watch this, yo, yo
Massage, peppermint oil, shampoo and pears
Cinnamin, aloe, natural for you hair
Soak lavender soap, coconut conditioning
Honey lather, blood flowing, love listening
Motion lotion, breeze, over the ocean
Lovers, bath crystals, lovers sponge scrubbers
Hot milk bath, steam shower rubbin
Diesel splash, long lovin in your oven
Bake it off, break it off 'til it gets soft
Passion fruit, pussy cat, want to touch it off
In and out, fragrance patience, Hershey's Kisses, Guinness Stout
Stress reliever soak your feet, air them out
Brain message, think about pink
Stress relieving, no dishes in the sink
Upper lower, left, right, neck don't play
Back rub, Calgon, take me away
Waterfall beads, streams, plush and lavish
Comfort me through all the damn madness
Night breeze at sea, sipping tea
You and your queen melodies, and trees, 85 degrees
Jet skis breeze...
Sprinkle water on chocolate, butter scotch flowers
Vapor action, tropical sunshower
Baby powder, relax, feel for an hour
Sand suntan, snuggled up snug
Snowey days, fireplace, oriental rug
Thugs, lay on the couch, pull it out, perfect balance
Chemical stimuli, two tokes off the chalace
Complete silence, what surround us
Whats the finest, wrapped in cold sheets
Vanilla apple heat, flutes play jazz music, puffy pillow suites
Breakfast in bed, early morning sun treats
Sunset level, suprise sunrise, sail
Lay on the couch, while I clip your toenails
Dreams of peaches and cream steam secret spells
Soft spoken gospel, Barry White acapell
Violin, good medicine, sound swell
Sunshine life, love right without the hell
Taste sugar, quiet storm, seasick
Slowdance drink, like nights over Egypt
Having, stabbing, calm chilling now we rolling
Company, ice cream licking now we holding
Gentle force, warm tingle of the golden
Open loose, ice cubes, kiss your belly
Alcohol, palm trees, peanut butter jelly
Almond twirl, fantastic melodies
Soon, taste these spoons
Wiping me with toon, fly wine, quiet storm
Now it's high noon, raspberry spices
Cherry breath, drink from the mountain, sip the very best
Sounds of the shore, every winter is a war
Paradise life, recipe now pour
Musicness, model, gentle mental
Wash away your sorrow, Fantasy Island
Put the message in the bottle
Carry you through, the threshold, do my duty
Happy ending, go to rest Sleeping Beauty


Yo, this is that body shop shit
Love love slam
Edible underwear, champagne, bubble bath
Have your snack on that ass that
Know what I mean?
Massaging these melodies
Put that gangsta shit on the shelf
Blow winds, blow, through your hair
Sea breeze sticks and shit
Right right


When your around boo
Come and chop this mother fucking beat you stank-ass trick

Wer versteht etwas, von dem was ich sage?
Keiner von euch Lutschern, denn ihr seid nicht in der Lage
Du verstehst nicht was ich mein, ich versteh nicht deine Frage
Bin halt so frustriert, weil ich meine Grnde habe
Sag was tut dir weh und verursacht bei dir Schmerzen?
Tief in deinem Herzen, deine Jungs sind oft die ersten
Reden ber dich und woll'n sich's aber nicht verscherzen
Auf einmal siehst du klar und diese Tage sind am schwersten
Um mich 'rum ist eine Sperre, Mauern dick und Stacheldraht
Kehr mein Inneres nach auen, Negerkrause, Stachelbart
Versteh' mal einen Bruder ohne 'ne einzige Kommune
Ist auf sich allein gestellt, wie ein Fang an der Harpune
Eines wusst' ich, wenn bei dir der Frust spricht
Intellektuelle machen sich gern drber lustig
Dreh noch meine Runden, spiel mir "Sehe-das-was-du-nicht-siehst"
Lese das, was du nicht liest
Hol dich aus deim' Paradies
Arroganz, denn berheblichkeit, meine Wenigkeit
Fr gewhnlich ziemlich cool, doch damit komm ich eh nicht weit
Schau wir Leute sind verschieden
Ich brauch' nicht dein Respekt, wenn's so wre wrd' ich lgen
Du kannst es dreh'n und wenden, wir kommen niemals auf den Nenner
Warum musst du soviel reden, komm wir regeln das wie Mnner
Tief in mir drin will ich eigentlich was anderes
Tief in mir drin bin ich eigentlich ein anderer
Ein Wanderer, und leiste ungern Widerstand
Es gab so viele Battles, wo man niemals einen Sieger fand

That's right, that's right, that's right

Ya'll motherfuckers want this money, bitch

Bitch let me show you something
My name's Dirt Dog, bitch ain't no frontin
Bitch let me show you something
My name's Dirt Dog, bitch ain't no frontin

AAAAAAHHHH!!


Walking down the street dark, dark, night
Saw a pretty girl, bitch caught my sight
Bitch, so fine fine as can be
Bitch, you know you belong to me
Drove over said how you be
Bitch you know my name's Dirt Dog, dope MC!
Dirt Dog I know what you about
Bitch get the fuck in the car!!
Drove her to my house
Aaaaahhh to my house
Open the door take off your clothes
Throw'em on the floor took off my clothes

Bitch dis something that you'll never forget
On the 1st pump started to scream
On the 2nd pump she thought she had a bad dream
On the 3rd pump she started to cry
Dirt Dog I don't wanna die
Well shut the fuck up!!
Pussy ain't nuttin but a skinny ol' bone
You can fuck it you can suck you can leave it alone
25 cents is the regular price
50 cents you can fuck it twice
75 cents you can fuck it to the bone
And a dollar' worth leave it alone



(Disjointed)
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city you
Got a...wait, wrong song


(Disjointed: Verse 1,2)
Yo im the man, get on a both knees quick
Boast these kicks with a motif spit
Choke weak pricks for a whole week, shit
No speech shows me that I dont speak sick

Im kidding, bboy, Im leonard nimoy
Leroy jenkins, live long and prosper sipping tea boi
Dont fake your death next march
Rocking toe tags walking so fast on the death march

A demigod, getting hennessy buzzed
Sending many pennies to any semi menacing thugs
Getting a massage and shedding my skin
Snake fretting women dreading getting my webbing in them

Funny how the game works, Im loving the craft
Sunning on your lame words and cutting in half
And doing it in half the time, straight mastermind
Bloody as baths inside a calf Im gutting to laugh

Tongue of the lamb, pungent as ham
Nice folks wont run with the clan
Find a good rapper not under my hands
Is like tryna find normal chums I can stand

I need rest sister, bless mister
Dissing me and youll wake up with sex blisters
Killua, the chest fister
Im stressed, the whole games a mess, sister

Get a grip, need the medicine
Pestilence esque symptoms develop quick
Swabbing the poop deck
Pirate hat, iron clad mop Im using, wired ass

Tried to rap and the fda shut it down
Im a striaght fucking clown, need another round
Hear the muttered sounds I utter out
Fear the haunted houses, you wanna bounce

(Mawthra: Verse 3)
Yo yo gimme bout four minutes
Imma bring ya little 16s that're more with it
Than any whittled shitstains that're your writtens
When you hear my pistol spit bang shit is raw isn't it

Motherfucker be glad that the pigs got you
I don't fuck with the court wouldn't been a lawsuit
Would've been me pullin all the sin off you
Matter' fact whole fam they get dropped too

These kids liftin up but they pen copied
Shit expect a little call if you rip off me
If you see me on the street better dip probably
Bitch dont expect a diss when you been bodied

No caution we throw the stone of wrath
Two kings on a throne of broken glass
On a path to slow the prone collapse
Of our home, the stolen notion, rap




It is written (manifest)
That all men are brothers (prophecy)
We come like blood brothers (word is bond)
'Cuz blood is thicker than water (a-alike)
From the misty grounds (from the unknown)
The shadows (the deep)
The darkness (the triple darkness)
Gravediggaz (my blood brother)


I grew up in the violent island of Shaolin
55 Morris, 6th floor, 10th door
When "Jackpot" Watt was hot, I was not
A rusty-ass child with tears and snots
Acquired the knowledge how to master my thoughts
My skinny frail body couldn't fuck with the sports
Six feet two, still wack on the court
So I stalked New York with a black pitchfork
My style date back to ninety-watt
Conion box, Wallabee Clarks with no socks
Remember the days before your pants would sag
Puerto Ricans on the block just throwin' up tags


Yo, I was born with a rusty spoon as a mouthpiece
Life was hard cause the graves was my company
Hang with my problems as his trouble predicted
To cross the path, as I laugh at the victed
No warmth for sure, the vents would spit average
Watchin' devils, fiend like a savage
Blood brothers need me call (ooh-ooh!)
In a minute, a minute, Ghostface and all, check it
RZA, Grym and the Undertake
Devil's get baked, I'll sniff your ass like a eighth
Tortures and screams buildin' up my steam
Death do us apart rushes through the bloodstream
Yo, something ain't right, I don't get it
I feel a vibe, blood brothers, are you with it?
If I have to choose one or the other
Back the fuck up, spook, yo, that's my blood brother


All, all, all in together
Blood brothers all in together (X4)


Back in the days of Lee's and BVD's
I grew up deceived by wicked enemies
My lifespan began to dim in the era
When you can't even trust the man in the mirror
Now Gravedigga niggas receive my trust
And like Christ, we walk among the thieves and the sluts
Night brings stress like skins on PMS
The street's a bloody mess, there ain't no EMS
In sight my thoughts are to leave the slums
I hustle with beats and drums, not kis and guns
My feet are numb, as I walk my dogs
I cut off the flaws with the Gravedigga swords
Life parole, as me and my man is violated
Hookers are neutered and spated
Snakes are decapitated and castrated
Niggas is lost, your whole ark is bein' raided
Shows today are hectic, niggas'll wreck shit
Lick off rounds and jet quick
This piece is gettin' heated
Foes are rushed and stampeded
Devils are all defeated by the blood brothers




Yeah, as the earth erupts
I conduct to destruct your flux when I big up
Catastrophes are blasphemy
Pour a container of brains on your grave through a strainer
I capsize your coffin, I wreck your morphin
Can beat devils down like Steve Austin
I gotta rip on a peel for a meal
Let's get some God degree
'Cuz a blood brother's hard to be


Power equality, Allah sees equality, follow me
Law and order but it's thicker than water
Many heads got slaughtered back in Latin Quarters
Like this brother named Rick was slick
But got bit by the same mothafuckas that he ran with
Band of the hand, the Clan's my fam
Something mom-dukes could never understand
From the grave to the gutter, death to another
Who try to fuck with my blood brothers





Yo, break that dutch down



You and your man, y'all fucked up for real
Now we got to show y'all niggas the deal
I sling raps, like cracks on the street
Attack, riot, rise above
Smash y'all, trash y'all, show y'all love
Thoughts are bright like a lightbulb
Ice cold raps, you stroll
Lease a finance, one chance, be my CD entity
Your energy is too low to bite my slug
You get drug behind bars and death is stoled on
Your code too simple, you best to hold on
Meet number three slang auxilary, and slang therapy
Based upon a true story, throw darts
Cut markers, straight duplicators, it's the terminator, Wu Killa Bee
Understanding, old special ed with the plate in my head
Bad bread, spare life, KKK on the mike, power like thing of state
What, play with the pussy and fuck
Stuck with the poles forever, what
Wu-Tang Forever, never sleep
Lyrics that kill, murder one voice
Chill or get dropped, your weak team ain't appropriate to no lessons
Adolescence, rhyme war, encore, surrender to my rap, I'm stuck on the map
Like I told you before winter war, in these days of hardcore
Smoke never stop clearing, stop cheering, you making me hot
Acid rain, a capell, wet you
And upset you, get you death threat, on cassette, it's the project
Reject, with the mic check
Set to be the son that set the place off
Face off, my darts is loving you, cyanide made your piss smell like flouride
Heavy stride, see it from the outside, archive five, smoke blunts hard



Blood on blood war, take your mind on tour, stand tall like the Berlin Wall
Automatic darts are pulled
Stand for, never ignore the silence and violence
We live for a blood on blood war
Blood on blood war, take your mind on tour, stand tall like the Berlin Wall
Automatic darts are pulled
Stand for, never ignore the blood on blood war
Uncut raw we live for



All I need, is ten big bags of weed
Twenty-four acres of land so I could breathe
Money like Dusty, Prize like Leon, throw darts at you if the heat's ever on
Split you with the .45 caliber rap
Beat y'all down with shit that sound fat
Call 911, you still can't score
You and your dulla ain't prepared for the war
Yeah, you got heat but we got C4
Plus we got buildings that's watching your door
Hunchback, Chi-kids, Brother Jihad
VGL, FMF, the Bam Squad
Terrorize y'all from every direction
Call up Hot 97 for protection
Cappadonna, from the Wu-Tang Clan
Spotted last night in the all black van
Coming down the block with guns out the windows
Licking shots off every time a wind blow
My class come first, I'm first to represent
Killa Bees linger in the air like incense
Instant action, speed of a satellite, insight
Sight snakes from afar
Ajar, one side of a 2 faced bar
Project star, CD hackers
Supreme rapper, with the baseball cap
I attack fatal on the track



Blood on blood war, take your mind on tour, stand tall like the Berlin Wall
Automatic darts are pulled
Stand for, never ignore the silence and violence
That we live for a blood on blood war
Blood on blood war, take your mind on tour, stand tall like the Berlin Wall
Automatic darts are pulled
Stand for, never ignore the blood on blood war
Uncut raw we live for
Yeah

*6 gunshots, then the dropping of shells in the background*




Afro Samurai...
Blood...


It's a family affair
It's a family affair


Blood, is thicker than mud
Even gangstas and thugs'll prove family love
It's a family affair, no calamity there
It's humanity share, who's the rightful heir


With sword style so retarded, it leave enemies
Dearly departed, and we nearly cold hearted
But, down for the fam, mad rivers of blood
It started pouring on land, this be a warrior's clan
Without a friend in the world, they find you in the end
But I'm loving my girl, cause she fight for the win
Will sport a sinister grin, when blowing smoke in the wind
Committing menacing sins, all in the name of the kin
With pinpoint precision and a 'fro's that's wild
Cold razor sharp style again, we killing them down
Stay defending on ten, never depending on men
Living the samurai code from a hundred on in




Will keep blades even sharper than Hattori Hanzo
And be the last man standing after the last blow
Slice with one swipe and like a shovel, the gensu
And swarm like the Wu, when the planet come blitz you
A wise samurai who's alibi is this high
Humble as a butterfly, but a killer inside
Strong family ties, will keep equality prize
Solidy rise, to each other, honestly we can fight
In tune on the attack, platoon up in the back
With room, taking no slack, we zoom in the format
Typhoons, kabooms, and full moons when we combat
Killas for contract, with ninjas and all that
And if you ain't family, we barely gon' interact
Love is for kin folk, a bond is a killer's pack
We strike too quickly for the enemies to react
Blood thick as mud, and a heart is a road map




Oh child, oh child, grows up be
Somebody, just a little blood
And ah, blood child, grows up to be
The one who just loves blood
My love, supposed to build, see it's in the blood
Refuse to love, blood's thicker than mud, just stand that






Bloody days, bloody nights
I will never give up on the fight
Is my soul, up for this right?
Is my heart, struck for this plight?
Many days, many nights
Never felt this strong in my life
Youthful heart, belongs to my knight
Is my soul, up for this plight?


Kill 'em... kill 'em... uh-huh, kill 'em...

Yeah - pages in my heart, you ripped the family apart
Insanity sparked, my soul fill in purple dark
It's murder from the start, survivin like Noah's Ark
I'm Alpha Afro, hit 'em with a thousand darts
You left us for dead, my blade sharp drippin red
It's barefaced cool and no doubt I'm here to take your head
I'm at the pearly gates, my mission to terminate
A guilty conscience only leads to your bloody fate




Youthful heart, belongs to my knight
Is my soul, up for this plight?
Bloody days, bloody nights
I will never give up on the fight
Is my soul, up for this right?
Is my heart, struck for this plight?

"The headband shall be, ours!"




Bloody samurai, my feet will never die
Bloody samurai, my sword will never die


Yeah
I'm like daredevils, I dare devils to take it to that level
Make 'em dig they own grave
Wit they own shovels
Sharpshooter
Drop helicopters, black out shadows
Cuz when it's time to ride, it's like pedal to the metal
Full fledged
Beat suicidal, leave holes with skull heads
Hit your cult for your vault, leave 'em all dead
And some
Nice swipe game plus handsome
Hoes hold me ransom
Get mad and throw tantrums
Seven braids like Samson, strength of Job
Since these niggas wanna trip, I make it all unfold
Didn't choose the genie
Didn't choose the leprechaun
Niggas better watch the gravesite
They stepping on Thinking it's a game
I rose him
Now your ass is frozen
Nuclear explosion
We straight West Coastin'


I was born as a soldier, and I'll fight in a field
I'll run like a hunter, and I'll die in the field




The street apostle with Roscoe's
That'll burn flesh off your fossil
Make you suck on that nozzle
'fore you swallow these hollows
Clutching a bottle, yeah, I'm a hard act to follow
Nigga, I don't write raps
Little homey, I write novels
Every chapter I capture, the mind of millions
When I slang raps like crack, to the women and children
Bring down the building
Crowd roars oh what a feeling
Feels good like I'm puffing on that sticky chameleon
The street villain
Made most of his money from drug dealing
It's rules to the game, trust nobody that's squealing
Cuz snitching is a pet peeve,
Like a bitch with a bad weave
It's not honor amongst thieves, nigga deal wit greed
I'm from a breed of real killas
That's cutthroat
That'll front you to work and kill you if a buck short
Bloodsport
Flick you like the butt of my Newport
Or with the butt of my gun
Take that, nigga, run


I come to stop the hollering and screaming, blaow
Stop screaming, make a nigga wish he still dreaming
Since appearing against a ninja, taught him barbarianism
South Central mentalism
Like the local news on the local high school for all this realism
Don't let all the whites go there cause all the whites'll go there
Have 'em all braiding they hair, and having tattoos
Aand street numbers instead of good grades from school
It's like ridicule, and what would Jesus do?
If he was standing at apartment, he was beeping with that dizzle
Like a hole ain't enough to end all ridicule
But a hoe'll get real holy enough to preach and end you




If you win, I'll tell you where to find the number two
If I win, I have your head
Do we have a deal?




Black Knights
West coast Killa Bee kill
Black Knights, Black Knights
You hear it from the distance


My brain sprouts branches blossoming tragic thoughts
Takes bully lyrics lunch money, pistols or microphone
Welcome to L.A. battle the unexplained
Scarecrows and apples meet Mr. Constrictus
Concrete knuckles and scuffles, I waste groups
Give 'em lumps the size of footballs, bricks and grapefruit
Make soup, blueberry while dining with classic monsters
Better check my sponsor chop before you can answer
Brothers in the Contra, bullet holes in the stop sign
Gods in the neighborhood, pistol in the sunset
Lyrics, the bitch pressed dump trucks with one thrust
Faster than sound, light, or speed that your gun busts
Among us, west coast wreck hopes, infect dope
Whining cause your last Holocaust cassette broke
The hunchback tic-tac heads come to get you
Nine-hundred and forty-three missiles made of crystal
Light a match to those, the crowd put all their lighters up
Stomp through the graveyard in the rain, the architect
Bricks in the mud, the cold weather is scorchin
For boxcar children and orphans, wrote a portrait
Chewing on cactus, rappers better practice
Slimey like a catfish, dollers in the mattress
A hand-carved pipe from Baton Rouge to Cherokee
Grand-high count, feed Macadamias to parakeets
French lemonade, skeletons on the highway
Clove, gets rowdy I'll box my way out
Poor righteous teacher, devils better fear us
Or my pistol splatter your brains accross the mirrors


Bluntz, Martinez, Girlz and Gunz


Gut 'em like a fish, the man who bled Marbles
Bloody Mr. Fixit, holocaust and guns
Stumbled through the doorway wearing my evening chains
Real as the hallway red and blue Crayolas
Now leaving stains, architect from Cali
Rumble through the mist covered valleys, dirty alleys
Crumbs in your suitcase, ice fishing with pelicans
Big 'ole tackling skeleton, you're irrelevant
Riding jeweled elephants, California horizon
Track mud through the kitchen, murder henchmen
Strange man's pockets, cigarettes and candy
Walk with a limp, chance of a lifetime
Bandits want cyborg crank, tic-tac
Blow holes through emcees, size of bowling balls
Briefcase man chant, my flavor's building
Set a fishbowl full of jelly beans out for the neighbor's children
Two-fisted brawler, good times in the sunlight
Tracked him one night, you call and cause a gunfight
Holo-holocaust is sleepy, holdin microphones
4 dead men in the alley, the butcher
Shirts with the blossoms, west coast the gentlemen
Holding the pistol, smoke blunts for hours
To understand the language of flowers
Gritty mugshot, missed her arms and legs, drool bullets
Bedtime time to turn in but into what?
A well set table, third rock from the sun
Dead men hung, Cadillacs and dinosaurs
Hot peanuts and fireworks, the holocaust


Bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz
Bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz
Bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz girlz and gunz girlz and gunz

Bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz
Bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz
Bluntz, martinez, girlz, and gunz girlz and gunz girlz and gunz




Ultimate Breakbeats and shit right?
Niggas still making money offa those shits
Looping the same shits for a thousand years and shit, right?

You know us to be robust, the greatest crew since Cold Crush
This poisonous slang keep MCs avoiding us
Can't think about the proper remedies for destroying us
Your best bet black is sit back and start enjoying us
And run your commissary, attack your coronary
I'm with every revolutionary
Honorary and sonic electronic brain like Johnny Mnemonic
Get boosted from the sorrow and went Wu-tonic
You be fickle, get your tongue thrown into a jar of pickle
To serve to your bird with cheese and pumpernickel
Beefsteak Charlie, a classic like Marley Marl
Tie your ass down and run you over with a trolley car
My nigga Lucky keep 'em Bucky like Dent
Intent, read the fine print
It says, "Do not enter or cross the lines
You be tossed behind and forced to submit to the rhyme"


B-O-B-B-Y
D-I-G-I-T-A-L

.44 in the holster strapped tight by the Velcro
Steel padded vest on the chest, arm knife on the elbow
Pointed rings resemble Killa Bee stings
Instrumental of slinging swords, taking a buck bring
Rain, hail, snow, earthquakes, search your mental birth date
50 straight push-ups keep the body in perfect shape
Just got hit on the hip by this bird talking 'bout
She got a blister on her lip, that comes from not gargling after sucking
I'm toggling the buttons on my cell-phone
Call my nigga Tone, the well known
Bubble goose feathers made 'em think it's Carl Weathers
Solid chrome Beretta 9s stuffed inside the Wu leather
Hot shots melt through your pleather
Never Ending Story not from the Land of Nether
We fight for our rights to the death like Medgar Evers
Wu-Tang Clan Forever, All In Together Now

D-I-G-I-T-A-L

Up from the rugged grains of Shaolin soil
Ol' Earth kept a nigga spoilt
Though the reigns to my veins remain royal, burning up
High speed dub, my CD spins like a hub-cap on a Ac'
Tre-pound snub rap we might joust
Fresh spring water from the Alps
Stalked like a tomahawk, Indian bitch you get scalped
Like a ticket sold in Cleveland, you feel me in
And now I stream up your bone marrow
Wu-Tang song last long as Christmas carols
Niggas throw darts, I'm shooting flaming arrows
Pierce through your physical faculties with pinpoint accuracy
You don't wanna battle me








Aiyyo, let me tell y'all niggas somethin'
One thing, let me tell y'all niggas somethin'
I don't give a, flyin' fuck about
None of y'all niggas out here
None of y'all niggas out here
Cause you ain't, none of my motherfuckin' comrades
I don't give a, flyin' fuck, what?
You want it? Bring it son, bring it son
Bring it, yo, check it on out


Bobby, como puede ser que me jodistes?
Hijo de puta
 el coo de mi, maricon
Y nunca me llamas, Roberto
You treat me like an analog ho


Yo, lyrically, I got all y'all niggas under my wing
Cause I bring terror throughout this rap era
Like them Muslim cats, who don't give a fuck
About blowin' this rock, off the map
Where Mayor Guiliani rest at, so let me get that
Microphone up off of you, cause it's
Definitely not meant for you to have it in your palm
To try to rock the crowd
Puttin' it all on to stay calm
You waited for the God Islord to drop the bomb
And swarm the stage about a hundred fat
With lyrical material that's all that
Like a two point five carat clustered jew-el
Rock like Patti La-Belle
Cause everything is real kid, you dead up
Dissect the true kids gettin' set up
For a car/Jeep heist, it ain't nice
As we ran up in the crib and stuck the kid
And smacked the wife, cause she, had on two chains
With a tray full of ice in 'em
But that's how it goes down
When you livin in the Cold World


Cold World, what?


Todo lo que a ti te gustas es music pa' lo puta


Yo, I spit flames thermonuclear type
Ignite mics, blow up U.S.A. satellites
Insane Unabomber, my whole fam lace golden armor
Royal calmer, black queen black Madonna
The missing link be the big lips on the Sphinx
Intelligent instincts
I say knowledge is the foundation
When I move in the L's formation, against Hell's nation
Bobby Digital cybertech test micro-check
High bi-as, record the levels
Anti four devils anti four devils


Bobby, como puede ser que me jodistes?
Hijo de puta
? el coo de mi, maricon
Y nunca me llamas
Me tratas like an analog ho, Roberto
Nadie te importa, cario
I wanna be Digital Bobby
Bobby Digital
RZA me advertio de Bobby
Bobby Digital


All you analog cats from weak tracks, and weak raps
And weak video clips and weak stacks
Beatin' bitches with weak lawyers, and weak acts
And weak staffs, born life couldn't copyright
With weak math, come get a dose, of the strong
Coconuts splittin', all you chocolate deluxe butter alms
French buttercups, probably wanna see Bobby in handcuffs
With the toes in my mouth
Stand up or rape me, rotate auto-locate me
In the center solar
Corner block Hip-Hop now expand to the polar
Fuzzy low short frequency
Circuit breakers, try to take
Us on illusionary rides to the future
Polygram graphic rap actors, flash ya
Cash and jewelry like bus passes
That's why your ass got stuck up
So wake the fuck up or get smoked
Analog rhymes hoes are like groupies we fucked
Took for derelict, sales are too soupy
Better get the Bobby Digital movie!




Tarantula, that groove season
Newlywed of rap, which G you believe in?
Rally back, twist a half a man arm off
Late night, nearly happy standoff
How boldly blinded by Bobby crossthievin' van diva
Lever 2000 mic talk
Might bolt to match, pinch me in the eve
Carved perfectly from God
Manufactured through the eye, came Puma dash
I snares Dumar, Nicolas, half a face, Cage
Half a coke Dutch sprinkle sage
Bounce to Huey crib yo and got laid
Straight off the ground y'all word up
Bad bitch


Yo, yo
Yo my tapdance sword splash
Yo.. my nigga Dix'll leave you whiplashed, feel the cash
Pussy worth a key a stash, bloodbath
Hard to walk the righteous path
Flavor for life into death
This berry tart your ginger
Ooh she mad tender, analog surrender
Off my motherfuckin' splendor, Jamie Sommers pussy bionic
Super-sonic, splash you with the Wu-Wear garments
For the nine fuckin' nine, motherfuckers

Bobby, all you ever want is weed, money, music, and pussy




Bird flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze drifting by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for...
Bird flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze drifting by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me


Who be the last man standin' when I cock back the cannon? (Bobby!)

Yo this is Westwood
I'm at Radio 1 just doin' my thing tonight
And just walked into this studio some of the hottest UK cats out there
My man Skinnyman {Woah, woah}, Blade 
And Mr. Tibbs what's the deal? What you got for me?
{Yeah we got ya the new banger Tim straight from RZA
Straight from the Wu-Tang}


(Yeah representin' live all my UK hip hop heads in the North Side, el tarno)
Down it's gonna bang in ya face, lets go


Regardless, I'll be here bringin' it heartless
Ruthless, to the death I'll stand for the truth yes
My God given talent is all that I can do best
Keep spittin' over these tracks and leavin' you blessed
So who requested my time on the set
Skinnyman's what you get, so you ain't really hearin' nuttin' yet
Ya best upthreat cuz it gets better yet
I'm that deft intellect, them boy they don't pent
So who requested Wu-Tang on the set (it's the RZA)
What you get so you ain't really hearin' nuttin' yet
We'll never let anybody else step
Or ever come with anything less for what you'd expect
If you pass me the mic then I'll gladly accept
I'll take it to the street, show you how rough it can get
Cuz everybody knows this rappin' thing isn't happenin'
Now they jack it in and go back to shottin' crack again
Locked down the block and get strapped with the gat again
Then we break it down then just deal with the matter then
So how you'd think a British ghetto youth feels
He can't get a record deal but he can get drugs to deal
He can't get a job but he can go for rob and steel
Lookin' for a mill' while you screamin' "keep it real!"
So I'll just stand here with this mic that I hold
Request the higher force to sweep over my soul
So I can fulfill my dream, go for my goals
I'm sick of spendin' every late night out of role


Skinnyman make the party Boing, bza Boing, Boing
Blade make the party bza Boing, Boing
Mr. Tibbs he makes the party Boing, Boing
Bob Digi makes the party Boing, Boing
Skinnyman make the party Boing, bza Boing, Boing
Blade makes the party bza Boing, Boing


Calm but still merciless, rugged on impact
Explosive, leavin' nuttin' but rubber with a spinback
Snap a photo with your camera, capture the stamina
Hand it to a amature, show him how to damage a
Live set, make him feel the full effect
And yet still make it hard to detect and what's left?
Four men remain standin' like Gladiators
When the dusk clears nuttin' for the average ears
For years its been the same with minds of the artillery
God forgave us all for the merciless delivery
Holdin' the tools of the trade with a death grip
Rememberin' the times when nothin' was right, we was desperate
Dreams blown to smithereens, turned into nightmares with screams
There's a world of CREAM
If all goes correct we can stash supreme
Feed the fiend cuz that's the way it was meant to have been
You should of seen the comin', the language is universal
One time perfect attack with no rehearsal
Shook the Earth for what it's worth
You're in danger of a takeover, and it's analysed as global
We can find them whatever your predictions
Enterin' the realm unknown with no restricitons
It might be hard to believe
We invade, we conquer and lead


Skinnyman make the party Boing, bza Boing, Boing
Blade make the party bza Boing, Boing
Mr. Tibbs he makes the party Boing, Boing
Bob Digi makes the party Boing, Boing


I'm a country man at heart but a city man by nature
Cuz even though it's fuck free, it's all about the paper
I love to live expensive, smoke like I'm in Jamiaca
Even when I'm broke I think I'm like but a creater
Avoids the green, even from my early teens
???????? in need of CREAM seen (seen)
But then I had a dream 'bout bein' the best rapper
But that ain't what it seems, next chapter
That's spreadin' the word
Inspiration from the hurb is what you hear when I got heard
I sat back and observed most of the men that shined before me
All that respect, keeper know 'nough of them will bore me
Singin' the same story, I'm better than you
And to tell you the truth most of them men are shut fools
We asked them in the struggle to make ends meet
That's why I told these MCs that talk is cheap
You might think you know Tibbs, you don't know me
Unless you walk my streets and talk to my peeps


Bob Digi makes the party Boing, Boing
Skinnyman make the party Boing, bza Boing, Boing


With your high pitched face like eye liner
If the black gat bust you get struck by the side winder
You can't block and stop it when I spotted
I shoot like Luke Skywalker inside the cockpit
Aimin' at the top fighter
Who I mighta have thirty thousand kids spark the lighter
And set flames to the sky, we aim high
The baseline kick like the kid from Shang-Hi
Make your bubble bust, cuddle up from the rubble thrust
You'se will have the double juice duck, then I doubled up
To the double four, puddles pour from ya bum bot
Open swords can't be cured by the blood clot
Ya bum bastards, son I come classic
Frame won't last the length of my matchstick
Drunk off the Hennessey V.S. stop the B.S
I'm still off to catch the CREAM like P.S
Jake was makin' that green
People always say what the hell does that mean


With Skinny man he makes the party Boing, Boing
Bob Digi makes the party Boing, Boing
Mr. Tibbs he makes the party Boing, Boing
Bza Blade he makes the party Boing, Boing
Skinnyman make the party Boing, a bza Boing, Boing
Blade make the party bza Boing, Boing
Mr. Tibbs he makes the party Boing, Boing
Bob Digi makes the party Boing, Boing
Skinnyman make the party Boing, a bza Boing, Boing
Blade make the party bza Boing, Boing
Mr. Tibbs he makes the party Boing, Boing

Leozzie de volta, niggas be like "t sumido?"
Tava escondido, porque eu ainda to falido

E em agradecimento vocs podem chupar o meu pau

Peguei pesado mas foi totalmente necessrio
Cara ignorante o meu rap game  Mario
Balotelli, quando eu chego cs pensam fudeu
E eu saco a camiseta escrito "por que sempre eu?"

Salvar o dia? esse  um trabalho pra mim
Sou tipo um imperador, livro meu povo do fim
Toca po pai e aprende, mais ou menos assim
S quero que deus perdoe esses rappers ruins

Habilidoso igual Neymar, s que eu no dano
Calmo igual Zidane, um pouco mais manso
Minha vida  trabalho e maconha sem descanso
Eu olho, pego, puxo e passo, Paulo Henrique Ganso

Tenho pegada de animal, Edmundo
Tipo Galinho, Falco e Pato vagabundo
Aqui no tem Rubinho, no nasci pra ser segundo
Nem Messi nem Ronaldo apenas o melhor do mundo



 (U-God):
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on
Yeah, my nigga come on
(This is Digital, this is sizzlin

Bitches always sayin "Why you talk like that?"

Why them R&B niggas tryin to sing like that?
And you fake crossovers tryin to bling like that?
You know, my clique snatch ice like that
Take it down to the scale and get a price like that

Kinetic 9, Bob Digi


Yo we out like that




For y'all niggas gettin high we go like this
Bong bong..
Pop that shit..






Hahaha, Digi, yo, yo


When I was young, I slept with a battery on my tongue
So when I spit, the impact with the sting of a stun gun
At full blast, rock your cradle, fatal razorblades graze you
Split you open, stitch you back wit a staple
I'm football head, I put your head
Into a brook, all four, your momma wouldn't look at ya'll
Gold from the Panama canal, Alabama gam'
Got me laid up, on my nuts like kapow
B-O-B-Boy's fast as Bruce Leroy
Meet the rap Galactus, blow planets off his axis
My Glock is plastic, my dick *sniff* is magic
Stretch up the Power U like Mr. Fantastic


Stop, it's a booby trap
Wouldn't you rather have a Digi or a Scooby Snack?
Digi Snack, yeah, while we living in a booby trap


Yo, when it comes to this mic device, you get ate
Like the gingerbread man try'nna cross the lake
Or the Winchester, call my white son, Lester Poindexter
Tell 'em bring back the black mack, strapped with two extra
Clips, where's the natural, words inside the apple
Pot holes in the street, it cracks the Jeep axle
Shrivel your heart to a raisin, shorty star gazing
Yeah, he got steeper than dunce, once he start blazing blunts
Beef, and get drown in Hunt's
Your flame get toast, your best bet to punt
I lounge like a hungry jaguar, into agua
Trying to catch a fish that multiply like the magua
Pocket fat be Jabba the Hutt, Clan gallops up
Feel the Force of my steel, but you can't count the caliber
Digi, Digi, Digi, all inside your city
Microphone on the roam, like Capone and Frank Nitty




I don't got a taste for blood or flesh skin
My mind, like Professor X from the X-Men
One line, cause MC's to write their albums down
Devils only come amongst you, if you allow them now
Do to trading, they infiltrate with persuasion
That desire to rob and steel and make slaves of all
Living luxury, destructively, conductively
Improper nature, privately and publicly
Man so stupid when confronted by something he don't
Understand, he shoot it, the whole world's polluted
My earth gave birth to a universal, change us
Scribes reflect the child born in the Bethlehem manger
Devils try to steal me of my intellect, rob me of my culture
Like they white washing sculptures
Like they snatching down my posters
But it's been caught through the eyes of Minolta





**DOOM's verse is from 'It Ain't Nuthin' -The Herbaliser feat.MF DOOM
RZA's verse is from 'The Night The Earth Cried' - Gravediggaz


It ain't nuttin like a fistfull a cash or a bliss fulla the hash
That twist like a mustache, from end to end, spread it like a rash
From talking through your walkman or at your disco bash
Gimme the timbs rumple stiltskin brown
A metal face mask with a built in frown
A mic to tilt down, a hundred thousand pounds
And see how kilt sound like spilt milk clown

Cocoa butter on very ashy day fam
With Ray-Bans out on the islands of Cayman
Or i'll break it down for the layman
Bain de Soliel, for that St. Tropez tan
A can a ole gold too cold to hold, slow ya roll
Keep on moving like Soul II Soul, hold the dough
Like a fool who stole pity y'all
From tryna go up against city hall titty bar

The black mic is like a red violin
Ok, everybody back to the lab, try again
Bloody rap game like leviathan
Leave a bad taste, killin my high like niacin
Stop kiddin middlemen need Ritalin
Hit me with the full tin of gin and im a kid again

Keep the bong lightin straight through the song writin
The Supervillain AKA the thong bitin, thats inviting all
To the recitin thats dope and raw
Hoping all yall come in peace and its open bar
Tear the roof off this bumba rasclaat
By the end of the night spazz like shazbot
Spilt a shot made the pen lines runny
A ill plot thats ten times Ben Stien money.... funny

How he rips the scripts with a straight face
With more rhymes than is lines in ya database
Placing rappers in endangerment, who's reckless
With this food for thought sorta like breakfast
You could mark it off as wreck on the checklist
Wear gold fronts, can't afford no necklace
Shit, that there, could go to help them daycares
Somebody say yeahh.. (yeahhh!)
Pay ya fares,... give the Herbalizers his shares
And y'all could pay DOOM in beers.. Cheers!..


I came to the shores of America disguised as a pillar
The alpha and omega and the home of the beggars, the black sellers
Who been beaten, raped, lynched, robbed and stoned
And caused to roam the earth in service cause they couldn't maintain at
Home
This dates back to 1555
When they captured the first tribe of men
And piled them in a pen
Fifty feet high
They took em all on a 9000 mile ride
And landed on the shore of a place they never seen before
But read about this inside the ancient books of war
Bonded in stainless steel, stripped of their language
Still survived the anguish of slavery but still remained nameless
Separated to portions and tricked by John Haughty Hawkins
And sold on the auction, taught birth control and abortion
Rulers of the first part became slaves of the worst part
The devils cursed God and reversed God
And turned God into dog and made people search hard
No relief came to the prophet of W.D. Feraud
To a trauma, dropped our mommas off in Bahamas and Barbados
Tobagos, separated us from slave boats
Made our own brothers hate us
From Virgin Isle to Jamaica
Trinidad, Honduras, Haiti, Grenada
Bermuda to Cayman, mental enslavement
You black gods become awaken




Wu Tang will survive, no no no-no no no
Wu Tang will survive
Cause every time they flip a party
You know the party screams and shouts
Cause you... DAMN! Aw, TC that was the bomb...


Get all my peoples, get all my peoples headphones
All of em
Lay em a death warrant
Aaaah, yo, show it off, kid, show em, what, what
Let em have it, bust it, hey yo, hey yo


Blend wine, who want to win mine
Shorty get a ten-round for floatin
With the richest, huh
Flexed out, Flinstone style
Your crimi-nal pen pal kidnapped Loud, jetted the
Mosyin, posin for them niggas up in Poland
Rollin wax style museum, G 'em
Them richest niggas bless this
Like Russian cut VVS's
Slide the hatchback, black were finessing this
Them niggas over there know, Gazelle goggles
And them Lottos, 88 style, throwin' bottles (bottles)
Scenario rap, rap imperial, material (uh, yo yo, yo, yo)
Murderin' cats is like that real


Yo come do me somethin word to Michelob peep the Land Rov'
Sleeper hold club faggots lay your dome on a stove
It's like space kid, the whole world is pitch black, granola rap
Dough got smaller famous team, walked up in Fotomat
Black down, numerous rounds, boots is brown
Getaway driver, this white bitch from out of town
We love horse races shakin Jakes and high-speed chases
Porno stations, drinkin violations, godly nations
90 minute Maxell tapes, instrumental breaks
Bangin earaches, lay my verse down in two takes
The speaker pops, the Winchester rifle's in the kitchen
Murder the DJ's eyes twitchin, woofer hissin


Yo, he's strong armin, manipulatin niggas, scrapin niggas
Takin play from niggas, hate fakin niggas, yo you hear me?
The whole shit's like wrestling
What you dare me? Back the fuck up kid, we flexin


This rap shit bust yo' gums, and leave you stunned
Pull your plug, now you can't function
There's no to-tal or sum to this equa-tion, you fro-zen
Many may come but few are cho-sen
Pretty niggas want to play the war po-sin
When the ruckus come, they be the first to get their shine stolen
Do or die, it be I, Meta-physical Man
Holding court from my Wu, indivisible clan
I see your thoughts and your hand reachin
It's getting deep in this mud
Cats heat seekin, for one blood
Nameless thugs been aiming slugs, shootin at these stank bitches
Less he gon' bring this above, I make switches
From the lamp I grant three wishes
Johnny be parlayin, I Blaze britches, then I roll
One hundred percent mind, one hundred percent body
One hundred percent soul, individual
Assholes tend to run
From this PLO extortion to the one
The next chamber, you fuckin with the star spangler
To the dawn's early light with this head-banger
Boogie, represent this shit fully
Like I'm constantly at war with the town bully
Who want that pressure, about to get smacked silly
Like a fat bitch in Spandex, free Willy!
We on some milli, check the joint, engine number nine
Niggas wastin time worryin about me and mine
Get your own shit
